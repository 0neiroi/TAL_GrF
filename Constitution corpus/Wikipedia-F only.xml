'''Nick Fallon''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. The role was played by [[Blake Berris]] from November 7, 2006, to January 15, 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that Berris would return to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-blake-berris-days-return |title=EXCLUSIVE: Blake Berris DAYS Return |work=Soap Opera Digest |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on August 27, 2012. His final air date was May 12, 2014, when the character was killed in a [[whodunit]] murder mystery.

==Storylines==
{{plot|date=May 2014}}
Nick, the son of Joshua Fallon and Jessica Blake (the daughter of Marie Horton and the granddaughter of Alice Horton), came to [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]] to get to know his Horton relatives. His medical knowledge and intelligence were put to the test when he was asked to help save [[Kayla Brady]], who was suffering from a rare ailment. He succeeded in saving Kayla, and found himself intrigued by [[Chelsea Brady]]. Nick created an online identity to chat with Chelsea in an attempt to get her to fall for him, and provided a picture of a handsome colleague of his when she pushes to know what he looks like.

Later, Nick helped Chelsea get money to [[Shawn Brady and Belle Black|Shawn and Belle]] who were on the run with their daughter Claire in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Nick's clever and brave actions on this mission caused Chelsea to take interest in Nick as more than a friend. However, shortly after returning from Canada, Chelsea discovered that Nick was her online love. She was devastated and saw Nick's actions as a malicious trick, thinking that Nick used the online lover to secretly mock her while she revealed her inner thoughts and feelings for the first time. She tearfully told Nick that she never wanted to see him again. Hurt, Nick had an affair with Chelsea's mother [[Billie Reed]], who, under the influence of alcohol seduced him. Billie and he both regretted it, and swore never to tell anyone.
 
When Nick saved Chelsea from getting raped by Dr. Reibert, whom she had been dating to spite Nick, she forgave him. Nick began tutoring her in math and this led to them dating. Unfortunately, Chelsea soon discovered Nick and Billie's one-night stand and their relationship was again in turmoil. Then, when [[Willow Stark]] accidentally set Bo and Hope's house on fire, she panicked and attempted to frame Chelsea by planting her hairbrush at the crime scene. At Chelsea's cry of innocence, Nick risked his medical career by stealing the hairbrush out of the forensics lab. Chelsea was so grateful, she was able to forgive Nick for his indiscretion with Billie, and they soon rekindled their romance.

Later, Willow emerged as a threat to Nick and Chelsea's happiness. When Nick stole the hairbrush, it left Willow as the only suspect for the fire. Nick felt sorry for Willow and lent her money. Willow asked for more money, and Nick leased an apartment for her and gave her his credit card to use for her and her baby. Willow used Nick's credit card excessively, then she called Nick and blackmailed him into giving her more money, credit cards, and all kinds of stuff.

Nick later went to the beach to meet Willow and they got in an argument and a struggle that lead to Willow falling, and hitting her head on a log. Nick tried to revive her but Willow died. He found the hairbrush in Willow's possession and buried it in the sand on the beach before calling for help. While Nick was investigated by detective Roman Brady, he convinced Chelsea to go to the beach and destroy the hairbrush. Roman eventually learned the truth, and gave both Chelsea and Nick a pass by closing the investigation.

Nick was also blackmailed by [[Kate Roberts (fiction)|Kate Roberts]] into making Sami's [[amniocentesis]] say that EJ was the father of Sami's twins.

Nick saved [[Sami Brady]] and [[Lucas Roberts]] from a bomb that Dr. Rolf planted, sustaining head injuries in the process. While suffering from a concussion, Nick went to Las Vegas and married a woman named [[Cassandra Arvin]], who was using the alias &quot;China Lee&quot;.  Arvin was eventually persuaded to sign annulment papers. Then she was arrested and went to jail for soliciting, leaving Nick with custody of her two sons, Artemis and Demarquette. Nick deduced that Artemis and Demarquette were not really China Lee's children, which she confirmed upon her release from jail. She had been hired to protect the boys, but refused to retake custody of them. A man named Umar Maboud came to Nick's home and claimed that he worked for the boys' parents and had been sent to bring them home. Nick did not trust Maboud, and [[Jeremy Horton]] (who was staying with Nick at the time) successfully fought him off. Weeks later, Chelsea was abducted and was permitted to use her cell phone only to contact Nick, who was directed to come to a designated location, alone. When he did, the kidnapper offered a hostage exchange: Artemis and Demarquette for Chelsea. Unbeknownst to the man, the boys had followed Nick to the warehouse, but were able to escape. While Nick worked to avert the detonation of what turned out to be a fake bomb, Artemis and Demarquette were rescued by Umar Maboud. Maboud really was in the employ of the boys' parents, who were wealthy foreigners with many enemies. Having secured political asylum, they wanted to be reunited with their sons; Chelsea's abduction had been a ploy by the family's enemies. Nick agreed to let Artemis and Demarquette go.

Nick and Chelsea got back together. He helped Chelsea find proof that Ford Decker was the campus rapist by breaking into Ford's room in order to take photographs of his drugs and journal. After the campus rapist situation was resolved, Chelsea and Nick grew apart because of her attraction to Dr. Daniel Jonas, and the two eventually broke up. Nick then began working on a research project involving alternative fuel sources and began a relationship with Max Brady's half sister, Melanie Layton. Nick ultimately began stalking her and was then revealed to be the killer of Trent Robbins, Max and Melanie's father.

On January 14, 2009, Nick was tried for the murder of Trent Robbins. Maggie and Melanie gave testimony as to why Nick should not be put in jail for the rest of his life. The judge agreed and gave Nick the sentence of 2 to 5 years in a facility and 18 months for good behavior. Nick was thankful to Melanie for her testimony as Melanie told Nick that she forgave him because deep down he was a good person.

On January 15, 2009, Chelsea comes from the hospital to the courthouse. Nick tells Chelsea he's sorry for everything and tells her to move on with her life. Chelsea tearfully tells Nick that he will always have a piece of her heart and that he can focus on getting better.

On August 27, 2012, Nick returned to Salem and, still in jail, had a parole hearing. Having been recently kidnapped, Melanie did not know how she felt. Against the advice of her family, Melanie decided that Nick really had changed, but wanted him to stay away from her. Nick was released and threatened by Chad to stay away. Caroline forgave Nick and gave him a job at the Brady Pub. Chad beat Nick up after believing that he had Melanie, since he had her scarf. Later, Nick met Melanie's former friend Gabi, and they started dating. On November 14, Gabi found out she was pregnant with her gay ex-boyfriend [[Will Horton]]'s baby. Nick agreed with Gabi and Will that he would raise the child, and that he and Gabi would get married. Nick and Gabi had a church wedding, but before they could be pronounced husband and wife, Chad objected, saying that Nick was not the father of Gabi's baby, and it finally came out that Will was the father.

At a later date, Nick blackmailed Will to give up his parental rights to Gabi's baby, by threatening to tell that Will was the one who shot EJ. With several other people around, including Sami, Lucas, EJ, Sonny, and an attorney Nick brought, Will signed the agreement. Nick and Gabi married in a private ceremony. Only later did Gabi learn that Will gave up rights to the baby, but she did not learn about the blackmail, though Will tells her he did not want to do it.

Nick had memories of something terrible that happened in jail, possibly involving another inmate, Vargas, who was recently released and  getting help from the church to adjust to regular life.  The terrible thing is later revealed to be repeated prison rape by another inmate named Jensen.

Nick was kidnapped, along with Gabi, and held hostage by Jensen. Will and Sonny saved them, with Will getting shot in the process. Nick then tried to make things right, considering that Will almost died to save him, and agreed to have Will's name on Arianna's birth certificate. Nick told Gabi the truth about his rape and about blackmailing Will.

Nick was fired by Kate in June 2013. In August 2013, when his parole was up, he was told to vacate the Kiriakis mansion immediately by [[Victor Kiriakis]]. Nick became obsessed with Gabi and got her a modeling job in New York, where he would be as well, hoping that they could be together. After Gabi yelled at him for interfering in her life, he followed her to the park where he tried to rape her. Gabi hit him in the head with a rock and Sami and Kate helped her drag Nick's body to the river where he briefly awoke before apparently drowning on November 27.

On January 24, 2014, Nick arrived at Gabi and Will's daughter's baptism revealing that he had not drowned. He appeared reformed but soon blackmailed Kate into hiring him. Nick also manipulated Gabi into giving him another chance, and she felt that she must do so or risk going to jail for trying to murder Nick. Nick later manipulated EJ and Sami into giving Gabi a modeling contract with Countess Wilhelmina. Later, Nick got involved in a custody agreement of Will and Gabi's daughter Ari, pushing Gabi to only let Will see his daughter at times she allowed it. Will and Sonny felt that Nick would manipulate Gabi until he had Gabi and Ari to himself. In the meantime, [[EJ DiMera]] found out that someone had pictures of him and [[Abigail Deveraux]] kissing sent to his house. EJ and Abigail later found out that Nick was behind it. On May 9, 2014, Nick was shot three times, once in the back and twice in the chest, and he died on May 12 with an open investigation into who was responsible. On May 30, 2014, It was revealed that it was [[Gabi Hernandez]] who shot Nick.

'''Fantômas''' ({{IPA-fr|fɑ̃tomas|lang}}) is a fictional character created by French writers [[Marcel Allain]] (1885–1969) and [[Pierre Souvestre]] (1874–1914).

One of the most popular characters in the history of French [[crime fiction]], Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from [[Gothic novel]] villains of the 19th century to modern-day [[serial killer]]s.

The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], in two respects:&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dvdoutsider.co.uk/dvd/reviews/f/fantomas.html | title=Getting away with murder, A region 2 partial DVD review of ''Fantômas'' by Slarek | work=DVD Outsider | date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their &quot;working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two-halves of the story together in the final chapter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;/&gt; This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the [[film studio]] could produce sequels reliably.

New Fantomas stories set in period are currently appearing in Bold Venture Press' pulp magazine AWESOMED Tales.

The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by [[André Hunebelle]] in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1963 with [[Fantômas (1964 film)|Fantômas]], departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone, and by making Fantômas (played by [[Jean Marais]]) more of a James Bond enemy. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.

==Overview==
[[File:Fantomas-mortquitue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A poster for the third ''Fantômas'' serial by [[Louis Feuillade]]. Fantômas wears his iconic black hood and black leotard, more sinister features than the traditional gentleman thief's domino mask and tuxedo.]]
Fantômas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Schütt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fantômas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to see Fantômas's tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Crime Fiction|last=Priestman|first=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-00871-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantômas was introduced a few years after [[Arsène Lupin]], another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] who enjoys killing in a [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] fashion.

He is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested [[rat]]s, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.

Fantômas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German Principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.

C. 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian Prince who was Fantômas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.

In 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and [[Mexico]]. There, he ruined his then-business partner, Etienne Rambert.

In 1899, he fought in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.

Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.

Fantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor who is employed at the newspaper ''La Capitale''. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was [[guillotine]]d in his place.

Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.

Fandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas's repeated attempts to break them up, married her.

Fantômas's evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girlfriend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.

===Notes===
* The original covers by Gino Starace are often considered works of lurid genius in themselves and may be seen at the &quot;Fantômas Lives&quot; site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fantomas-lives.com/ | title=Fantômas Lives | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Fantômas book cover, showing a contemplative masked man dressed in evening dress and holding a dagger, boldly stepping over Paris, is so well known that it has become a visual cliché.
* The novel ''The Yellow Document, or Fantômas of Berlin'' by Marcel Allain (1919), despite its title, is not a Fantômas novel.
* The last novel written by Allain was published as a newspaper serial, but never appeared in book form.
* During the 1980s, the first two novels of the series were published in revised English translations: ''Fantômas'' appeared in 1986 with an introduction by American poet [[John Ashbery]]; and ''Juve contre Fantômas'' appeared in 1987 under the title ''The Silent Executioner'', with an introduction by American artist [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[silent film]] pioneer [[Louis Feuillade]] directed five ''Fantômas'' [[Serial (film)|serials]] starring [[René Navarre]] as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, [[Georges Melchior]] as Fandor, and [[Renée Carl]] as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial ''[[Les Vampires]]'', which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual [[vampires]]) is also reminiscent of the ''Fantômas'' series.

There was a 1920 20-episode American ''[[Fantômas (1920 serial)|Fantômas]]'' serial directed by [[Edward Sedgwick]] starring [[Edward Roseman]] as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas's nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by [[John Willard (playwright)|John Willard]]. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title ''Les Exploits de Diabolos'' (''The Exploits of Diabolos''). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title ''Fantômas in America'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackcoatpress.com/fantomasus.htm |title=Fantômas in America |work=BlackCoatPress.com |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221212201/http://www.blackcoatpress.com:80/fantomasus.htm |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their tone was generally much more light-hearted than the novels' and the characters were updated in a [[James Bond]]-like style including Bond-type gadgets like the flying [[Citroën DS]] of Fantômas with retractable wings that converts to an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0058089|Fantômas|(1964)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
A ''Fantômas'' series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring [[Helmut Berger]] as Fantômas, [[Jacques Dufilho]] as Juve, and [[Gayle Hunnicutt]] as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by [[Claude Chabrol]]; episodes 2 and 3 by [[Luis Buñuel]]'s son, Juan Luis Buñuel.

The [[Fantômas (1964 film)|French movie version]] of ''Fantômas'' appears in the [[Czechoslovakia]]n 1979-1981 children fantasy series ''[[Arabela (TV series)|Arabela]]'' as well as its sequel series ''Arabela se vraci'', performed respectively by actors [[František Peterka]] and [[Pavel Nový]]. In this version, he does not perform a villain's role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children's series ''[[Lucie, postrach ulice]]'' as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers' depiction.

==Comic books==

===French===
* &quot;Fantômas contre les Nains&quot;. A weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in ''Gavroche'' #24-30 (1941). This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, ''Fantômas et l'Enfer Sous-Marin'' was written but not published.
* A daily &quot;Fantômas&quot; strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels.
* Seventeen ''Fantômas'' fumetti magazines adapting books 1, 2, 3, and 5 were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963.
* A new weekly &quot;Fantômas&quot; color page, written by Agnès Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in ''Jours de France''.
* Finally, a series of ''Fantômas'' graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by [[Claude Laverdure]] were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: ''L'Affaire Beltham'' (1990), ''Juve contre Fantômas'' (1991), and ''Le Mort qui Tue'' (1995).

===Mexican===
During the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a ''Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante'' (Fantomas, the Elegant Threat) comic book series that became popular throughout [[Latin America]]. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films. Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.

This Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal ''[[Diabolik]]'' — and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by [[Lucha libre|Mexican wrestling]].

The Latin American Fantômas mixed Italian and Mexican styles creating a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] - just as the [[flag of Mexico]] and the [[flag of Italy]] are made different by the central emblem of the Aztec pictogram for Tenochtitlan on the Mexican flag. The French character wore a black mask like his Italian inspiration, the Latin American a white mask like Mexican wrestling hero [[Santo]] (literally 'saint' in Spanish) - Italy faces Africa home to a majority Black population, Mexico the United States mostly with a majority White population. These characters had to remain relevant and mysterious to their specific geographical regions to survive and succeed.

Apparently the series was also influenced by the ''[[James Bond]]'' movies, as Fantômas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fantômas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American [[Hugh Hefner]], who created ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males.

Latino Fantômas also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 &quot;Zodiac Girls&quot;, beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames – the signs of the [[zodiac]]. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their [[femininity]] and preceding [[Charlie's Angels]] by decades.

Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival [[Grupo Editorial Vid]] in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both [[Central America]] and South America. Fantômas continues to be one of Latin America's favorite comic characters. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below.

===American===
A short ''Fantômas'' story by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Romano Felmang|Roy Mann]] appeared in ''[[Captain Action]] Comics'' No. 1, published in 2009 by [[Moonstone Books]].

==Cultural influence==
The ''Fantômas'' novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the [[surrealism|surrealists]]. [[Blaise Cendrars]] called the series &quot;the modern [[Aeneid]]&quot;; [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] said that &quot;from the imaginative standpoint ''Fantômas'' is one of the richest works that exist.&quot; The painter [[René Magritte]] and the surrealist poet and novelist [[Robert Desnos]] both produced works alluding to Fantômas.

The movies were also very popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fantômas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: &quot;Seven Old Men and One Girl&quot; (1968, directed by E. Karelov) and &quot;Old Men Bandits&quot; (1971, directed by E. Ryazanov).  In 2007, Russian author [[Andrey Shary]] published the book ''Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen'', dealing in particular with this phenomenon.

==Pastiches, homages, and related characters==
* ''Fantômas'' may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, ''Zigomar'', the creation of Léon Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in ''Le Matin'' in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in ''Zigomar contre Zigomar'' for eight more issues in 1924.
* In France alone, Fantômas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are [[Arnould Galopin]]'s ''Tenebras'', Gaston René's ''Masque Rouge'', [[Arthur Bernède]]'s ''[[Belphégor (novel)|Belphégor]]'', R. Collard's ''Demonax'' and Marcel Allain's own ''Tigris'', ''Fatala'', ''Miss Teria'' and ''Ferocias''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/marcelallain.htm | title=Marcel Allain - Tigris - Fatala - Miss Téria | work=CoolFrenchComics.com | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1915 adventure film ''[[Filibus]]'' was probably inspired largely by the popularity of ''Fantômas'', although the film's title character, a female [[air pirate]], strongly resembles [[Arsène Lupin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Uomini meccanici e matrimoni interplanetari: La straordinarissima avventura del cinema muto italiano di fantascienza|first=Paolo|last=Bertetti|journal=Anarres|volume=2|date=Winter 2013–14|url=http://www.fantascienza.com/anarres/articoli/32/uomini-meccanici-e-matrimoni-interplanetari/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the success of the first [[Fantômas (1913 serial)|Fantômas film serial]] directed by [[Louis Feuillade]], [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] produced another serial directed by Feuillade in the same style, ''[[Les Vampires]]'', about a gang of criminals. As Feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws, his next serial for Gaumont, ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'', starred this time a positive hero, a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of Fantômas. [[Judex]] was himself featured in various adaptations, sequels and remakes. The original ''Judex'' serial was released in the United States and appears to have been an inspiration for the American pulp character [[The Shadow]], who was himself an inspiration for [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Fournier, ''Super-héros : une histoire française'', Huginn Muninn, 2014, p. 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fantômas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two French stage plays: ''Nick Carter vs. Fantômas'' (1910) by [[Alexandre Bisson]] and [[Guillaume Livet]] (translated, ISBN 978-1-934543-05-4) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] vs. Fantômas'' (''La Mort d' Herlock Sholmes, ou Bandits en Habits Noirs'', 1914) by Pierre de Wattyne and Yorril Walter (translated, ISBN 978-1-934543-67-2).
* A number of Italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fantômas. Among the most famous are [[Diabolik]], [[Kriminal]], [[Killing (comics)|Killing]], and [[Satanik]].
* The British film critic and writer [[Kim Newman]] has argued that ''Fantômas'' inspired the ''[[Pink Panther]]'' film series starring [[Peter Sellers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;/&gt; In the initial 1963 ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|Pink Panther]]'' film, Fantômas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton (the Phantom), and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau.
* ''Fantômas'' also has many plot points in common with the 1969 Hong Kong movie ''Temptress of a Thousand Faces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teleport-city.com/wordpress/?p=921 |title=Fantômas Review |date=February 26, 2008 |work=Teleport-City.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094929/http://teleport-city.com:80/wordpress/?p=921 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paperinik]], (Duck Avenger) alter-ego of [[Donald Duck]] created by [[Guido Martina]] and [[Giovan Battista Carpi]] in 1969, is partly based on Fantômas. His predecessor, Fantomius, (Fantomallard) was obviously also named after Fantômas. In France the character is known as Fantomiald; in Germany as Phantomias; in Greek as Phantom Duck and in Spain as Patomas.
* ''Fantômas'' inspired [[Julio Cortázar]]'s 1975 novella ''Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales''.
* A character in the [[Doctor Who]] novel [[The Man in the Velvet Mask]] (1996) is named Fantômas.
* ''Fantomas'' was the inspiration for the character Mr. Ixnay, who appears in ''The Chuckling Whatsit'', a 1997 graphic novel by writer/artist [[Richard Sala]], creator of ''Invisible Hands'', an animated homage to old-fashioned mystery thrillers which aired on [[MTV]].
* In 1999, former [[Faith No More]] singer [[Mike Patton]] named his [[heavy metal music|metal]] group ''[[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]]'' after the fictional character.
* There is a [[Marvel Comics]] character named [[Fantomex]], first appearing in August 2002. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]] for the title ''[[New X-Men]]''.
* In one of the [[The New Traveller's Almanac|back-story sections]] of the graphic novel ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II]]'', Fantômas is described as being a member of &quot;Les Hommes Mystérieux&quot;, the French counterpart of the League, alongside [[Arsène Lupin]], the sky-pirate [[Robur the Conqueror|Robur]], and the [[Nyctalope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comp.dit.ie/dgordon/League/OtherLeagues/1910s/1910Mysterieux.html | title=Les Hommes Mysterieux 1910s | work=Comp.dit.ie | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the follow-up, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the League's encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fantômas detonates a bomb which destroys the [[Opera Garnier]], after saying in unaccented English, &quot;I win&quot;.
* The character of Spectrobert in [[Gahan Wilson]]'s book ''[[Everybody's Favorite Duck]]'' is a direct parody of Fantômas.
* Fantômas is a partial inspiration for the character of [[Phantom Limb (character)|Phantom Limb]] on the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' His last name, in fact, is Fantômas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in &quot;[[The Invisible Hand of Fate]]&quot;. It is revealed that Phantom Limb is actually the grandson of the famous criminal. Fantômas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode &quot;ORB&quot; as one of the original members of the [[Guild of Calamitous Intent]].
* Fantômas has a German cousin in the person of the (supposedly British) [[Raffles (Lord Lister)|Lord Lister]].
* In the story &quot;Fantômville&quot; by Nick Campbell, in the book ''[[Wildthyme in Purple]]'', Fantomas meets the time traveller [[Iris Wildthyme]].
* In the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', the Fantom (a character resembling the title character from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'') owes more than a little to Fantômas, although he is ultimately revealed to be [[M (James Bond)|M]], who in turn is revealed to be [[Professor Moriarty]].

'''Fantomex''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is commonly associated with the [[X-Men]] titles. Fantomex first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy#New X-Men|New X-Men]]'' #128 (August, 2002) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]]. Initially introduced as a character similar to [[Fantômas]] and [[Diabolik]], he is later revealed to be an escaped experiment from the [[Weapon Plus]] Program.

==Publication history==
Fantomex resembles the titular character of the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Diabolik]]'', whose film adaptation was released as ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', Diabolik's lover being named Eva. The character of Diabolik is loosely based on the character [[Fantômas]], the subject of a series of early-20th century [[France|French]] detective thrillers and a popular Mexican comic book adaptation, whose name is more directly reflected in Fantomex's own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #66], [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex's name, Jean-Phillipe, is a reference to actor [[John Phillip Law]], star of &quot;Danger: Diabolik&quot;. In addition, his Weapon X designation—&quot;Weapon XIII&quot;—is a reference to the secret agent protagonist of the Franco-Belgian comic ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]''.

After Morrison's run, the character made sporadic appearances in ''[[Weapon X (comic book)|Weapon X]]'' #23–25, ''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' #20–21, 24, the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: The List—Wolverine'' one-shot and in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #515–522 during the &quot;[[Nation X]]&quot; storyline before becoming a founding member of a new covert X-Force as seen in the monthly ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' series.

In July 2013, Marvel announced the character's first solo series, ''Fantomex MAX'', written by Andrew Hope, and illustrated by Shawn Crystal.  The series does not take place in current Marvel continuity, and the character is not affiliated with any other Marvel characters.  In this series, the character of Fantomex is a more literal take on the Diabolik character, with a storyline less influenced by traditional superhero plots, skewing more towards the concepts  of intrigue and James Bond-tinged adventure.  Issue #1 debuted on October 2, 2013.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Fantomex was created by the [[Weapon Plus]] Program to serve as a [[Sentinels (comics)|super-sentinel]] against Earth's mutant population. Weapon Plus created a population of [[Techno-organic material|technorganic]] organisms whose living tissue was fused with Sentinel [[nanotechnology]] at the [[Nanochondrion|cellular]] level. His mother, a member of this race, became pregnant when she was fertilized with [[Nanorobotics|nanomachine]]s, resulting in the birth of Fantomex. Like the rest of his people, he was born and raised in [[Weapon Plus#The World|the World]], a man-made environment designed to create super-sentinels, media-friendly mutant-hunters modeled after [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s. Although his nationality is technically British as the World was located in England, Fantomex claims he was raised in a virtual France with imperfect programming.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #13&lt;/ref&gt; He's developed a French sense of identity and persona; whereas his experiment designation at the World facility was &quot;Charlie Cluster-7&quot;, he usually goes by the name &quot;Jean-Phillipe&quot;.

===New X-Men===
During his first appearance, Fantomex seeks a safe haven at the [[X-Corporation]] in Paris while fleeing from authorities. He claims to be a mutant thief with the ill-defined power of misdirection. Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asks for asylum, which [[Professor X]] grants him. Fantomex explains to Professor X and [[Jean Grey]] that he is being hunted because he is one of the most wanted thieves in Europe. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey are able to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocks their mental probes. However, they agree to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surround the building, Fantomex uses his ship E.V.A. to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his home in France. While there, he introduces them to his mother and continues to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he tells the two that he has stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in the [[Chunnel]], and offers to sell it to Professor Xavier for $1 billion. After submitting his proposal, he puts himself in a light hypnotic trance and removes the bullets that riddle his body. Finished, he asks Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the Chunnel in an effort to destroy [[Weapon XII]]. The three speed away in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.

Fantomex then leads Professor Xavier and Jean Grey to the Chunnel disaster. Packed full of people and animals that Weapon XII has turned into mindless slaves, confusion runs rampant. Knowing that those who have fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence are lost, Fantomex kills [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] and all others who are mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slips a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrive.

Fantomex later travels to Afghanistan in an attempt to steal a list of the world's richest mutant slaver traders, the names on which he intends to blackmail. There he encounters an unconscious mutant known as [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], a former captive who unwittingly killed her captors by turning into a deadly sandstorm. Upon his exit, he encounters [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], leaving Dust in his care.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #133&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Fantomex contacts Wolverine and offers him information about his mysterious past if he helps Fantomex destroy Ultimaton, also known as Weapon XV, the last creation of the Weapon Plus Program. Fantomex, Wolverine, and the X-Men's [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] travel to the World, an artificial, time-altering environment designed by Weapon Plus to quickly develop and evolve new generations of super-soldiers.

The three are defeated by Weapon XV (Ultimaton), who escapes by breaking through the barriers of the World and flying to the Weapon Plus space station. The team pursues their target in E.V.A., Fantomex's biological spacecraft. Upon arriving at the space station Fantomex keeps his word by showing Wolverine the complete Weapon Plus database. Shocked at learning the terrible details of his past (including his role in the slaughter of the entire population of Roanoke while under the influence of [[Weapon X]]), Wolverine initiates the self-destruct sequence for the space station before catching and apparently killing Ultimaton (who reappears later as a subordinate&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Force'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;). Fantomex and Cyclops escape the explosion in one of the station's shuttles.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #145&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Earth, Fantomex joins Cyclops and a group of X-Men students in their fight against [[Xorn]], who had taken the identity of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He had gathered a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and had taken over New York City. With the aid of [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]], Fantomex, and the others were able to break into Xorn's skyscraper headquarters and bring him down.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapon X and Mystique===
Later on, Fantomex tries to track down [[John Sublime]], the director of the Weapon Plus program. However, upon examining his empty grave, Fantomex finds a note reading, &quot;Roanoke.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;  He locates the secret facility of the splinter program [[Weapon X]] and finds it abandoned except for [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]]. The pair reluctantly joins forces and travels to the site of Roanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, the three finally encounter Sublime but are opposed by his [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] and forced to flee against overwhelming odds. In an attempt to escape in E.V.A., Fantomex is shot down and left for dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Fantomex manages to survive and some time later is contacted by the diminutive mutant [[Shortpack]] who seeks his help in assassinating mutant arms dealer Steinbeck, also known as the [[Prudence Leighton|Quiet Man]], in revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack's care. Fantomex refuses, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack is captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shapechanging mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a double agent for both Xavier and Steinbeck's ally Shepard, learns of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter in Madagascar, Mystique finds Fantomex in Monte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense of being a mutant thief, and learns of Shortpack's plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;  As she leaves to rescue him, Fantomex follows and uncovers her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bids Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returns with the stolen goods (a vintage Spider-Man costume), Mystique infects both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaces and helps Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she finally defeats.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign, Nation X, and Second Coming===
During his tenure as leader of HAMMER, [[Norman Osborn]] tries to take control of the World and the Weapon Plus creations. Wolverine and [[Noh-Varr]] head to the World to try to stop Norman Osborn but are soon attacked by a large army of Weapon Plus creations infected by Allgod (Weapon XVI), the living religion. Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex (who has apparently spent all the time since his last appearance &quot;stealing things mostly&quot; and admits he should have kept an eye on the World), and the two of them make their way to the World's brain (now a sentient being) where they are confronted by the Allgod drones, Wolverine included. Fantomex is not affected by Allgod because nanites in his neocortex render him incapable of believing in anything greater than himself. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, thus showing it some compassion, and disabling Allgod. Immediately after this, the three of them defeat Osborn's invading army of [[Deathlok]] prototypes. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he reportedly stole from [[Doctor Doom]] to shrink the World and take it for his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: The List—Wolverine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards Fantomex is hired by a young mutant boy to hunt a rogue [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] stalking mutants beneath New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #519&lt;/ref&gt;  After dealing with the Predator X, Fantomex and E.V.A. run into Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who ask for his help to defeat the creators of the Predator X. Fantomex initially turns their request down, but is later convinced by the same young boy he helped to help the X-Men. Fantomex saves the team from a group of John Sublime's associates and later takes them home.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #521&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex remains with the X-Men on Utopia and is later seen in San Francisco fighting alongside the X-Men against [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion's]] army of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] sentinels.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #525&lt;/ref&gt; Once the battle is over, he's shown to have secretly joined a new iteration of [[X-Force]], alongside Wolverine, [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], Psylocke, and [[Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncanny X-Force===
[[File:X-Force Psylocke.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fantomex with [[Psylocke]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #12: &quot;Dark Angel Saga, Chapter 2: Interruption&quot; (art by Chris Stevens)]]

The first mission of the new team is an assassination job to kill [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], reborn in the form of a child and being indoctrinated by [[Clan Akkaba]] on their Moon base.  After defeating Apocalypse's Final Horsemen and getting to the young Apocalypse, no one on the team can summon up the courage to kill a child.  When the group resigns to bring the child back with them and to reeducate him, Fantomex fires a shot in the child's head, apparently killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Fantomex realizes a presence calling itself Weapon Infinity has started manipulating the timestream within the World. After a battle against Weapon Infinity (actually the transforming of all future heroes into time-travelling [[Deathlok]]-type cyborgs &lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #5&lt;/ref&gt;), it is revealed that Fantomex has actually cloned the Apocalypse child in order to see if the boy could become a hero if raised as a good man in a virtual environment deep within the World.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex is later abducted by [[Captain Britain]] who brands him a dimensional threat and take him to Otherworld, where an interdimensional court sentences him to erasure from existence itself. He is rescued by his teammate Psylocke, who turns against her brothers. Together they encounter the [[Skinless Man]] and rejoin their teammates to defeat The Goat, a corrupted future incarnation of Psylocke and Captain Britain's older brother [[Jamie Braddock]], who attempted to consume the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #20 - 24&lt;/ref&gt;

When Psylocke is captured by the newly reformed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Fantomex sacrifices himself to save her. He is captured and killed when the Skinless Man cuts out his heart. With his connection to E.V.A severed, she believes herself dying as well. She survives, however, and evolves into a humanoid form.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #27&lt;/ref&gt;

After Uncanny X-Force disbands, E.V.A. attempts to clone Fantomex back to life, but due to his three brains, an error occurs and three different bodies are grown for each personality: the evil brain becomes &quot;Weapon XIII&quot; (originally referred to as &quot;Jean-Phillippe&quot;), and wears a costume with inverted colors; the noble brain becomes &quot;Cluster&quot;, a female version of Fantomex; and the mischievous one is restored to his proper body, taking the name of &quot;Fantomex&quot;. He goes on to continue his relationship with Psylocke.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex and Cluster later hijack a plane (leaving the pilot drugged and the flight attendants bound and gagged) in order to find Psylocke and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but Weapon XIII follows and kidnaps Fantomex. Cluster enlists the help of the new Uncanny X-Force (Puck, Psylocke, Spiral, and Storm) to find Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force (vol. 2) #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyslocke and Cluster travel to Madripor to hunt Weapon XIII. Weapon XIII uses his power of misdirection (which Fantomex and Cluster no longer possess) to confess his love to Psylocke. She agrees to stay with him only if he allows her to kill Fantomex, who betrayed her during a heist at the Louvre. During a heated battle she decides to free Fantomex and stun Weapon XIII, stating that she is done with all three of them.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Force Vol. 2 #8&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Force===
Cable recruits Fantomex as part of his new [[X-Force#Volume 4|X-Force team]] with the promise that he'll help Fantomex find Cluster and Weapon XIII. He proves a questionable ally, as he constantly bickers with [[Psylocke]] and has a psychic sexual relations with Meme, who he really knows is actually Hope Summers (who Cable thinks is in a coma). He also kills new recruit [[List of Marvel Comics characters: F#ForgetMeNot|ForgetMeNot]] because &quot;he was bored&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 # 10&lt;/ref&gt; The only concession that keeps Fantomex in line is that he gets to kill Cable every night,since Cable's body dies at the end of the day anyway and he has a clone ready to take his place the next day. Eventually Hope hacks into his mind and unwittingly transfers the super-mutant genetic code from mutant arms trafficker Volga. He then betrays the team, but is shot in the head by Domino.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11&lt;/ref&gt; This is short-lived since E.V.A. is able to reboot his brain using the super-mutant code and now Fantomex has wings and god-like powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he is tricked by Meme/Hope Summers into thinking he killed the team, but once he learns the ruse he vows vengeance. Fantomex is tricked again by Cable by agreeing to meet at various spy organization or organized crime locations for showdowns, but X-Force never shows; however, Fantomex still destroys the base, which ultimately helps X-Force's missions. Fantomex eventually finds X-Force, but is tricked by ForgetMeNot into teleporting near Hope Summers, who copies his super-powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of fighting him head-on, Hope implants a thought into his mind that one cannot be perfect, unless you have a well rounded personality, which includes inadequacies and insecurities. Fantomex cannot comprehend being perfect and imperfect, so he has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psychic blades to scramble his brain.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Fantomex can create extremely realistic illusions (he calls this ability &quot;misdirection&quot;). This ability is based on &quot;reality skewing&quot;, rather than telepathy or holographic projection (Uncanny X-Force 14).

Fantomex has an external nervous system referred to as E.V.A. He has mentioned that E.V.A. emerged from his mouth during his time in the World and developed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel. The relationship between E.V.A and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A. experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. When E.V.A. is separated from his body, Fantomex feels no pain and seems able to ignore most injuries. Along with this symbiotic relationship, Fantomex is linked to E.V.A. via telepathy. He can see through E.V.A.'s point of view and can take control of her movement. However, this requires concentration on the part of Fantomex. Moreover, E.V.A, as a bio-mechanical being, can reshape her body into a variety of forms, fly herself, and generate energy discharges to be used as weapons.  Fantomex contains three brains that used for parallel and independent thinking as well as nano-active blood; the nanites in his brain prohibit him from believing in anything greater than himself, such as gods or any supernatural beings. He also maintains an internal back-up nervous system which can be engaged if E.V.A. is damaged. However, this system is less complex than E.V.A. and does not allow Fantomex to see colors.

He possesses enhanced strength, speed, agility, dexterity, durability, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. Fantomex is also capable of registering frequencies beyond the hearing range of normal humans. He even once mentioned a healing factor.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself : Uncanny X-Force'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

His three brains, allow him to survive severe head wounds since his secondary brains can take over should one be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. In this state, he can also recover faster while placed in water. He can expertly read the body language of others in order to predict their attacks.  He is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a master of stealth techniques. His title in his birthplace, the World, was &quot;stealth-fighter.&quot;

Fantomex is a superb marksman. He used to use special bullets covered in sentient mutant skin that never missed their target (designed by Sir James Braddock, the father of Psylocke and Captain Britain) but he used his last of these against Archangel. He carries a variety of guns and other weapons.

His mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics. These allow his mind to remain completely unreadable, even facing the most powerful telepaths of the Marvel Universe (Professor X and the Shadow King among others).

==Other versions==

===Days of Future Now===
In one variant of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline (titled ''Days of Future Now'' and depicted in Frank Tieri's ''[[Weapon X]]'' series), Weapon X and the Sentinels are at war with Wolverine's X-Men and many other mutant groups, including Excelsior and Gene Nation. In this timeline, Fantomex becomes the host of Sublime and, possessed by the sentient bacteria, sabotages Wolverine's efforts to overthrow Weapon X.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' storyline, set in an alternate timeline 150 years in the future, the entire world is ruled by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] (possessed by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]). E.V.A. is a member of this era's X-Men, which includes Wolverine, [[Tito Jerome Bohusk|Tito]] ([[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]]'s grandson), [[Sentinel (comic book)|Tom Skylark]] and his Sentinel known as Rover, [[Weapon XIV|Three-in-One]] (the Stepford Cuckoos), [[No-Girl]], and a reformed [[Cassandra Nova]] as their leader. E.V.A. has taken on a humanoid form and does not want to bond with anyone else's nervous system after &quot;what happened to Fantomex.&quot; Whatever happened to Fantomex is never explicitly explained in the storyline, though it is strongly hinted that Beast's U-Man follower, Apollyon the Destroyer, is actually Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #151–154 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men: The End===
Fantomex is depicted briefly in ''X-Men: The End'' as part of X-23's dream induced by the Ladies Mastermind, as she is stated to be in love with him in this reality. In X-23's dream, they are shown together playing with a small daughter in their backyard.

'''Marion Anthony D'Amico''', better known by his Mafia nickname &quot;'''Fat Tony'''&quot;, is a recurring character in the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Joe Mantegna]] and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=murderer&gt;Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Fat Tony is a [[gangster]] and the [[underboss]] of the [[Springfield Mafia]]. His henchmen include Legs, Louie, and Johnny Tightlips, and he answers to Don Vittorio DiMaggio.  The character somewhat resembles real-life mobster [[Anthony Salerno|&quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno]]. While serving his terms, real-life mobster &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno died in a federal facility located in [[Springfield, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/us/anthony-fat-tony-salerno-80-a-top-crime-boss-dies-in-prison.html|title=Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, 80, A Top Crime Boss, Dies in Prison|date=1992-07-29|author=James Dao|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
&quot;Fat Tony&quot; D'Amico was behind several of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s criminal enterprises. His [[racket (crime)|rackets]] included [[illegal gambling]], [[cigarette smuggling]], and [[rum-running|bootlegging]]. In &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot;, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] contracts with the mafia to drive out [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s rival snack food distributors. Fat Tony took out a hit on [[Mayor Quimby]] in &quot;[[Mayored to the Mob]]&quot; in retaliation for a raid on their rat milk facility, which Quimby opposed, as they had promised him &quot;dog or higher&quot;. Fat Tony puts out a contract on Homer after his private security business interferes with the mob's interests in &quot;[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]&quot;. Homer would have been executed gangland-style if not for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] coming to the rescue with her rifle. Fat Tony's son Michael is first mentioned by Fat Tony as he is talking to Marge in &quot;[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]]&quot;, saying she drove him home from school sometimes. He is then properly introduced in the episode &quot;[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]&quot;. The episode also reveals that Fat Tony's wife &quot;was whacked by 'natural causes'.&quot; Fat Tony and his associates meet in what is known as the &quot;Legitimate Businessman's Social Club&quot;. Fat Tony played the [[violin]] in &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;.

Fat Tony dies in the twenty-second season episode &quot;[[Donnie Fatso]]&quot;, only to be replaced by his slimmer cousin &quot;Fit Tony&quot;. By the end of that episode, Fit Tony has taken to eating as a way of dealing with the stress of assassination attempts. His weight gain causes a change of nickname to &quot;Fit Fat Tony&quot; and eventually &quot;Fat Tony&quot;, essentially restoring the original character. In &quot;[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]&quot;, he supposedly marries [[Patty and Selma|Selma]], but the relationship falls apart when Selma discovers Tony only held a ceremony to make her his [[gun moll|goomar]] as he is already married to another woman.

==Name==
[[File:Paul Sorvino.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Fat Tony's visual appearance was modeled after actor [[Paul Sorvino]].]]

Fat Tony's actual name is the source of some dispute, as several different real names have been revealed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, Fat Tony is referred to in a news report given by [[Kent Brockman]] as '''William''' &quot;'''Fat Tony'''&quot; '''Williams''', presumably an alias. In the eighth-season episode &quot;[[The Homer They Fall]]&quot;, the announcer at [[Homer Simpson|Homer's]] boxing match against [[List of celebrities in The Simpsons#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]] refers to Fat Tony as '''Anthony D'Amico''' (incidentally the name of one of the three Re-Recording Mixers in the end credits), which he is called later as well, for example, by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. In the twelfth-season episode &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Frankie the Squealer|Frankie the Squealer]] claims that Fat Tony's birth name is '''Marion''', a reference to actor [[John Wayne]]'s real name, Marion Robert Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).

===Development===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Bart the Murderer.png|180px|right|thumb|Fat Tony and [[Bart Simpson]] in &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;]] --&gt;

Fat Tony first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; The writers conceived the episode before the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', which has a similar plot, was released. However, when it was, the writers incorporated references to the film in the episode.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; Fat Tony was modeled on [[Paul Sorvino]], who played mobster [[Paul Vario|Paul Cicero]] in ''Goodfellas''.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; The appearance of [[Springfield Mafia#Legs and Louie|Louie]], one of Tony's henchmen, was based on another ''Goodfellas'' actor, [[Joe Pesci]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Rich (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the episode portrays a TV movie about the events depicted in the episode, in which Joe Mantegna will play Fat Tony (this was before it was decided that Fat Tony would be a recurring character).

===Voice===
The writers originally wanted [[Sheldon Leonard]] to voice Fat Tony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''Feng Meng/Beng Meng (Peng Meng)''', or '''Fengmeng''', ({{zh|c=逢蒙|p=féng/béng méng|w=feng²/peng² meng²}}) was a figure from [[Chinese mythology]] closely associated with the divine archer [[Houyi]]. He was the apprentice of the divine archer and was envious of his skill with the [[archery|bow and arrow]]. In a fit of envy and anger, Feng Meng murdered Yi with a club made from a peach tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Jeremy|title=Chinese Mythology|year=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|isbn=978-1-60413-436-0|pages=142–143|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in mythology ==
After his wife [[Chang'e]] consumed the [[elixir of immortality]], Houyi realized that he would never again be immortal and would soon die. He resolved to pass his knowledge and skills of archery and hunting to the next generation to ensure that they would live after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot; /&gt;  In order to do so, he decided to take an apprentice, Feng Meng; this apprentice soon became an expert archer but even so he was still envious of Houyi's superior abilities, especially after a fateful archery competition in which Houyi killed as many geese as Feng Meng did with his archery despite having a far more difficult target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Festivals&quot; /&gt;  Feng Meng made multiple attempts on his old master's life; tried to ambush him with his bow and arrow only for Houyi to stop his arrows with a return volley. Finally, Feng Meng resorted to the use of a stick made from a peach tree to bludgeon his master to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Tony Allan, Charles|title=Ancient China's myths and beliefs|publisher=Rosen Pub.|location=New York|isbn=1-4488-5991-3|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stories are told of Peng Meng, set in times previous to or after this fateful event. In one telling, told during the Chinese 'Mooncake Festival' or [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], Feng Meng (rendered in this translation as Peng Meng), was the cause of Chang'e's fateful decision to consume the elixir of immortality herself instead of sharing it with him. In this telling, Feng Meng attempted to steal the elixir of immortality from Chang'e by force while Houyi was out. As she realized that she couldn't defeat him, Chang'e escaped the only way she could—by consuming the elixir of immortality and ascending to the heavens where he couldn't reach her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Festivals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Chinese Festivals|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/Festivals/78311.htm|publisher=China Internet Information Center|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewcanadians.com/CULTURE/mooncakefestival.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lauren Fenmore''' is a fictional character from the American [[CBS Daytime|CBS]] soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. Introduced by [[William J. Bell]], the character made her debut during the episode airing on January 21, 1983, portrayed by [[Tracey E. Bregman]]. In 1992, Bregman brought the character to ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', resulting in her migrating there fully in 1995.

The character was first married to private investigator [[Paul Williams (character)|Paul Williams]] ([[Doug Davidson]]) for two years. Much of Lauren's history on both soap operas revolves around her rivalry with villain [[Sheila Carter]] ([[Kimberlin Brown]]). They first fought over [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Scott Grainger]] ([[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]]) in the early 1990s, with a [[love triangle]] forming around the three characters. The character was married to Scott twice and shares a son with him, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scotty]] ([[Blair Redford]]). Lauren has had numerous other storylines with Sheila throughout the years. In 2000, Bregman returned to ''The Young and the Restless'', remaining on a recurring status.

In 2007, the character killed Sheila in self-defense. Lauren also has a long-running romantic history with [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), whom she married in 2005. They share a son together, [[Fenmore Baldwin]] ([[Max Ehrich]]). In 2010, Bregman portrayed dual roles as Lauren and Sheila's previously unheard of sister, [[Sarah Smythe]], who was also killed by Lauren in self-defense. In 2013, after twelve years on a recurring status, Bregman was placed back on contract with the series. The actress has been positively received for her portrayal, which has garnered numerous [[Daytime Emmy Award]] and [[Soap Opera Digest Award]] nominations.

==Casting==
Bregman initially believed her role as Lauren would be brief, but after six months the soap offered her a contract and she accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;article&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Walking the Tightrope of Success | publisher=Rosemary Rosst | accessdate=2009-02-24 | url=http://www.celebhost.net/traceybregman/article3.html}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Bregman began making recurring appearances on ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. Three years later, the actress left the role on ''The Young and the Restless'', migrating to its sister soap full-time until 1999. After a return guest appearance on ''Y&amp;R'' in 2000, Bregman returned on a [[recurring status]] on August 24, 2001. In March 2013, it was announced that after twelve years on recurring, Bregman had been placed back on contract with the series. She was downgraded back to recurring status in May 2016.

In 1985, Bregman became the first actress to be honored with the  [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series]]; when it was then titled &quot;Outstanding [[Ingenue (stock character)|Ingenue]] in a Drama Series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Children' Heads Day, Nominations|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|publisher=[[Black Press]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=May 30, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emmy Belongs To CBS But For Non-Winner NBC, Awards Day Was The Longest Day|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=August 2, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATAS 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The 33rd Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award Nominations |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/33rdAnnual_daytime_nominees_only.html |publisher=emmyonline.org and [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |date=February 8, 2006 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HiEUlRtm?url=http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/33rdAnnual_daytime_nominees_only.html |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATAS 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The 35th Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award Nominations |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_35th_nominations.html |work=[[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |publisher=emmyonline.org |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |date=April 30, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HiF4EwPL?url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_35th_nominations.html |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is known for her longtime rivalry with Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). On the topic of Lauren and Sheila's &quot;cat fights&quot;, Brown said: &quot;People like cat fights because we can get away with what you can't get away with in everyday life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [boy] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it.

A woman claiming to be Sheila's sister, [[Sarah Smythe]], had [[plastic surgery]] to look like Lauren; she wanted revenge on Lauren for killing Sheila. Of the storyline, Bregman said, &quot;Sarah really wants Lauren to suffer because Sarah has suffered so much. In Sarah’s mind, Sheila was murdered in cold blood by Lauren.

==Storylines==
Lauren Fenmore, an only child, is raised by her father [[Neil Fenmore]] (Jim Storm) due to her parents divorce. Lauren rebels during her teen years, singing with [[Danny Romalotti]] ([[Michael Damian]]) and [[Traci Abbott Connolly|Traci Abbott]] ([[Beth Maitland]]), who was her rival for many years to come. Lauren spends years bullying and scheming against an insecure Traci. As she matures, Lauren falls in love with and marries private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]] ([[Doug Davidson]]), to the dismay of his interfering mother [[Mary Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Mary]] ([[Carolyn Conwell]]). A stalker named [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Shawn Garrett|Shawn Garrett]] ([[Grant Cramer]]) targets Lauren and forcing her to lave Paul by threatening to kill Paul if she didn't.  Lauren discovers she is pregnant and is buried alive by Shawn (after he overhears her true feelings for him), though eventually saved by Paul, having lost the child. Paul leaves Lauren for good after she sells a nude photograph of him to a magazine. Neil dies and leaves Lauren as the owner of the Fenmore Department store chain.

Lauren falls in love with and later marries [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]] ([[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]]). However, a mentally unstable nurse named [[Sheila Carter]] ([[Kimberlin Brown]]) plots to steal Scott away from Lauren. Sheila drugs Scott and sleeps with him, allowing herself to become pregnant; Scott leaves Lauren to be with Sheila for the sake of the child. During this time, Lauren finds out that she is also pregnant, while Sheila loses her child. Sheila then fakes a pregnancy and purchases a baby on the black market and switches it with Lauren's baby boy when he is born. Lauren is left to believe her child died, though Sheila's mother Molly (Marilyn Alex) tells her the truth. Sheila kidnaps both Lauren and Molly and sets fire to the cabin they are in; Lauren and Molly make it out alive though Sheila is presumed dead. Lauren later learns that Sheila is alive in Los Angeles and engaged to [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]]). Scotty dies and makes Lauren promise to make peace with Sheila, who he believes has changed.  When Sheila later attempts to drown Lauren in a hot tub, however, Lauren informs Dr. James Warwick ([[Ian Buchanan]]) of Sheila's destructive past.  Lauren helps the Forresters get Sheila committed after Sheila holds them all hostage. During her stay in Los Angeles, Lauren engages in a brief romance with Eric, to the chagrin of his wife and Lauren's former friend [[Stephanie Douglas Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]). They eventually break up.

After crossing forth between Los Angeles and Genoa City, Lauren returns to Genoa City for a permanent stay in 2001, when she begins a partnership with [[Jabot Cosmetics]]. Lauren then reunites with Paul; the relationship recurs due to Paul's unstable former lover [[Isabella Braña]]'s ([[Eva Longoria]]) pregnancy, as well as his romance with another ex-wife, [[Christine Blair]] ([[Lauralee Bell]]). Lauren is stalked by a teenager named [[Kevin Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Kevin Fisher]] ([[Greg Rikaart]]), who developed an obsession with her. After learning that Lauren accepted his prom invitation only to try to make him confess the crimes he committed, Kevin holds Lauren captive. During the abduction, Kevin tries to commit suicide, though his elder half-brother [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]) talks him out of it and rescues Lauren. This period saw Lauren and Michael grow unexpectedly closer, and they begin a relationship which soon progresses into an engagement. Lauren's now grown up son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) returns to Genoa City. It is revealed that Sheila had broken out of prison and had another female undergo plastic surgery to take her place; Lauren believes this is Sheila and resumes her normal life after an anxious period. Sheila has been living near Scott, who she grew close to. Sheila then returns to Genoa City and torments Lauren, involving Kevin's father [[Tom Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]) in her next scheme. After Michael and Lauren's wedding, they retreat to a honeymoon on a yacht. Tom and Sheila show up, and blow up the yacht, allowing everyone to believe Lauren is dead. In reality, Tom had abducted both Sheila and Lauren. Lauren is eventually saved by Paul, though Sheila once again disappears.

Lauren and Michael become pregnant, though stress over Sheila wanting to steal her child leads Lauren to suffer anxiety during her pregnancy. She gives birth to a premature son, [[Fenmore Baldwin]] ([[Max Ehrich]]). Paul locates Sheila in Genoa City; she underwent plastic surgery to look like Lauren's best friend [[Phyllis Summers]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]). Paul holds Sheila captive in a cage she created herself to entrap Fenmore. Sheila manages to escape and kidnaps Phyllis, her daughter [[Summer Newman]] ([[Hunter King]]) and Fenmore. Lauren frantically worries and eventually tracks down Sheila, Phyllis, Summer and Fenmore. Lauren shoots Sheila and resumes her peaceful life with Michael and Fenmore. In the following years Lauren helps Michael deal with his father [[River Baldwin]] ([[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]]) and sister [[Eden Gerick]] ([[Vanessa Marano]]), who return to Genoa City.

Lauren begins acting erratically, even sharing a kiss with Paul at a bar. Soon, she is abducted by Sheila's previously unheard of sister [[Sarah Smythe]] (Bregman), who is aided by Sheila's long lost twin children, [[Ryder Callahan]] and [[Daisy Carter]]. Sarah then poses as Lauren, as revenge for killing Sheila. Michael rescues Lauren and Kevin's wife [[Jana Hawkes]] ([[Emily O'Brien]]), who Sarah was also holding captive. Lauren shoots and kills Sarah.

Lauren's life is complicated when she learns that [[Jill Foster Abbott]] ([[Jess Walton]]) is Neil's daughter, therefore her half-sister. Lauren's estranged mother confirms that Neil was aware of an illegitimate child, and Jill is granted ownership of Fenmore's Department stores. Despite an initial bitter rivalry, Lauren and Jill soon develop a relationship. Lauren continues to strive in her business career, earning a seat on [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]]'s ([[Eric Braeden]]) board of directors at Newman Enterprises. Fenmore soon develops into a rebellious teenager, much like Michael and Lauren were during their upbringing, and develops an obsession with a now also teenage Summer. Summer and Fenmore bully a troubled fellow student, [[Jamie Vernon]]. Jamie and Fenmore have a fight on a rooftop, and Jamie falls onto a roof below. Jamie lies and tells the police that Fen pushed him, which is false. District attorney Michael is now forced to arrest Fenmore, weakening Michael and Lauren's marriage. Michael moves out and Lauren has an affair with the manipulative [[Carmine Basco]] ([[Marco Dapper]]), who develops an obsession with his love for Lauren. The affair is revealed, further straining the marriage. With much work, Lauren and Michael are able to get back together. However, they are soon forced to deal with an unstable Carmine who is consumed by Lauren, posting a video of their sexual encounter online and even kidnapping Lauren briefly.

He later became G-Wing Governor but once [[List of Bad Girls characters#Helen Stewart|Helen Stewart]] ([[Simone Lahbib]]) returned to her position he returned as a prison officer and principal officer.

==Casting==
In 1999, Ellis accepted the role of Jim without needing to look at the scripts. The actor told Yvonne Swann of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that he had been in debt and welcomed the role. He added that &quot;it certainly put my name on the map&quot; as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swann|first=Yvonne|title=Mirror Works: Jack of all trades; My CV: Jack Ellis ... from treading the boards to TV baddies|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mirror+Works%3a+Jack+OF+ALL+trades%3b+My+CV%3a+JACK+ELLIS+...FROM+TREADING...-a0136492349|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==
[[Debra Stephenson]] who plays inmate [[Shell Dockley]], told reporters from the ''Daily Mirror'' that her character would begin a &quot;lusty affair&quot; with Jim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Thomas|title=Sex in the nick; new show will be TV's steamiest jail drama|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sex+in+the+nick%3b+NEW+SHOW+WILL+BE+TV'S+STEAMIEST+JAIL+DRAMA.-a060388929|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|author2=Carroll, Sue|date=15 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim begins a feud with Governor [[Helen Stewart (Bad Girls)|Helen Stewart]] ([[Simone Lahbib]]).

In one storyline [[Neil Grayling]] ([[James Gaddas]]) drugs Jim in an attempt to seduce him. Ellis told Steve Hendry from the ''Sunday Mail'' that he enjoyed the playing the story because it gave him the chance to be funny.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt; He explained that it was a departure from his character's &quot;brooding nasty presence&quot;. Jim is a &quot;predatory character&quot; but the situation changes and he is the victim. The scenes have a dark tone to them and are not quite politically correct. Ellis quipped &quot;it couldn't happen to a nicer guy&quot;. Jim deals with Neil's advances by sexually assaulting his ex-fiancee [[Karen Betts]] ([[Claire King]]).&lt;ref name=neil&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendry|first=Steve|title=TV preview : Steve Hendry on the next seven days on the box; Fenner hits a new low|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+preview+%3a+TV+preview+%3a+Steve+Hendry+on+the+next+seven+days+on+the...-a085150018|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=28 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Fenner is initially introduced to the series as a Principal Officer, ranking him above both Senior and prison officers. During [[List of Bad Girls characters#Neil Grayling|Neil Grayling]]'s ([[James Gaddas]]) reign as Larkhall's 43rd Governing Governor, Fenner is promoted to Governor of G-Wing making him 43rd in a line of 42 others. During Series 4, Fenner finds himself the subject of (unwanted) sexual advances from Neil; after Fenner succeeds in having Neil fired, he takes over as The 40th Acting Governing Governor of Larkhall, putting him in charge of the entire prison. True to form, Fenner abuses the power granted to him in his new position and uses it to further his own ends, rather than to assist with the rehabilitation of inmates.

His main enemy within Larkhall was [[Yvonne Atkins]] ([[Linda Henry]]). Fenner continually attempts to use his authority to punish Yvonne for various &quot;rule-breaking&quot;, although she is often not at fault. In turn, Yvonne would use the respect she had earned among the inmates to work against Fenner. Eventually, it becomes clear that Yvonne and Fenner couldn't co-exist within Larkhall for much longer and Yvonne arranged for a hitman to dispatch him. Unfortunately for her this was unsuccessful - due to a tip off from officer [[List of Bad Girls characters#Colin Hedges|Colin Hedges]] (Tristan Surrock) - and ultimately, Yvonne and Fenner's long &quot;contest&quot; of one-upmanship culminates in Fenner locking Yvonne in a disused hanging cell on a redundant wing at the prison. During the first episode of Series 6, inmate [[List of Bad Girls characters#Kris Yates|Kris Yates]] ([[Jennifer Ness]]) discovers Yvonne's decomposing corpse.

Fenner is murdered in the same hanging cell where Yvonne died. He was beginning to feel the effects of a couple of previous assassination attempts from inmates and staff. [[List of Bad Girls characters#Julie Saunders &amp; Julie Johnston|Julie Saunders]] ([[Victoria Alcock]]) poisoned some candles using bleach, Neil spiked his drink during his farewell party, [[List of Bad Girls characters#Tina O'Kane|Tina O'Kane]] ([[Victoria Bush]]) appeared to give him a poisoned [[cheese straw]] during that same party, [[List of Bad Girls characters#Darlene Cake|Darlene Cake]] ([[Antonia Okonma]]) and [[List of Bad Girls characters#Janine Nebeski|Janine Nebeski]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) used a crude [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] to fire a poisoned thorn at him. However, none of these methods succeeded in their purpose and Fenner clambers to the doorway of the hanging cell, where he is met by [[List of Bad Girls characters#Julie Saunders &amp; Julie Johnston|Julie Johnston]] ([[Kika Mirylees]]), who stabs him in the throat with an [[icicle]]. He dies in front of the hanging cell where he murdered Yvonne.

==Other appearances==
Jim features in stage version of the drama. The series' creative team Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus devised the piece, which had been planned for four years. The musical was first performed in 2006 at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Veronica|title=Jailbirds stage a musical breakout|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3652618/Jailbirds-stage-a-musical-breakout.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=([[Telegraph Media Group]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
For his portrayal of Jim, Ellis was awarded &quot;Best Actor&quot; at the 2004 ''[[TV Quick]]'' Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street wins top soap at TV awards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3633628.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Purnell of the ''Daily Mirror'' said that Jim &quot;turned out to be the chief screw in more ways than one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purnell|first=Tony|title=Last night's view|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW.-a060445200|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=2 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purnell later bemoaned the storyline in which Shell tries to get &quot;sadistic&quot; Jim fired, he questioned if anyone knew or cared about the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purnell|first=Tony|title=Last night's view|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW.-a060433481|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=4 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purnell later said that he hoped Jim would die after being stabbed by Shell.&lt;ref name=bottle/&gt; Tim Randall of the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said that the aftermath of the stabbing made for intense action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=Tim|title=Television your essential TV &amp; Satellite guide for the week ahead; Samantha Bond's peroxide look may have scared her son, but it got her a new role, says Tim Randall|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Television+YOUR+ESSENTIAL+TV+%26+SATELLITE+GUIDE+FOR+THE+WEEK+AHEAD%3b...-a072193140|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=24 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Mail's'' Hendry said that &quot;Mr. nasty&quot; Jim was the biggest villain on television. The character was voted one of [[Channel 4]]'s &quot;top 10 TV Bastards&quot;.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt;

John Russell of ''[[The People]]'' said that Jim was &quot;a screw evidently determined to live up to his job description, who lurches from one ludicrous scene to another.&quot; He added that &quot;grim Jim&quot; shared a torrid affair with Shell behind the back of his &quot;witless wife&quot; while having &quot;all the sexual appeal of a sinus wash&quot;. On Ellis' portrayal, Russell added that he &quot;just glowers in all directions and invites you to select whatever emotion you think he might be experiencing. If that is proper acting, I'm David Beckham.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=John|title=Jail tripe's past its sell cell-by date; TV|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JAIL+TRIPE'S+PAST+ITS+CELL-BY+DATE%3b+TV.-a061393151|work=[[The People]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=9 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A columnist for the ''Daily Record'' observed Jim as becoming &quot;hell-bent on self-descruction&quot; and digging himself into a hole. He opined that his greed and hunger for power could lead to his downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critic's choice; Love in the laundry room|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CRITIC'S+CHOICE%3b+Love+in+the+laundry+room.-a061511883|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=15 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was saved from Masque by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and agreed to join Cable's [[paramilitary]] group [[X-Force]] in return for protection.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #100 (the final issue of the comic book series)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside X-Force, she first battled the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], and she broke [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]]'s jaw.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; She then severely injured [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] during combat training.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She fought her sister [[Thornn]], when Thornn and Masque invaded X-Force Base.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; She next battled [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside X-Force, she battled [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]]&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #7, 9&lt;!--Not entirely sure about those issue numbers--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was later compelled by the [[Dredmund the Druid|Druid]] to go to Starkesboro, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #407&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] saga, she was attacked by the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] alongside X-Force.  She was captured by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and was taken prisoner with X-Force by the X-Men and X-Factor.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #295; ''X-Factor'' #84; ''X-Force'' #16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Feral later received a new costume, and left [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] with the rest of X-Force.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; With X-Force, she then fought [[Nick Fury]] and [[War Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

Feral was always the ticking time bomb of X-Force especially when it came to teammate [[Siryn]], barely capable of controlling her deadly temper. Prior to joining the group, it was later revealed that Maria and her sister Lucia (who later became known as Thornn) had to leave home and lived with the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. It was later discovered that both girls had been [[child molestation|molested]] by their [[cocaine]] addict stepfather; in retaliation, Feral killed the man and shoved his body into the wall. Her mother, who was also addicted to cocaine, found out and sought vengeance on the girl by killing all of her pet pigeons. This infuriated Feral to the point where she also killed her mother in a fit of rage. It was also hinted at that she had purposely pushed their younger sister down the stairs, leading to her death, as well as allowed their younger brother to fall to his death from their roof. Ultimately, Feral betrayed X-Force and became the enemy of her former teammates when she was convinced to join the terrorist group known as the Mutant Liberation Front,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #28&lt;/ref&gt; although her alliances would continue to shift.

After a brief stint with the MLF, Feral emerged from hiding when the New York City police captured Thornn. Thornn revealed that she had seen Feral kill Harry Bellinger, their mother's boyfriend. [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] provoked Feral into admitting that she had murdered her mother. Cannonball overpowered Feral, and an old friend of Lucia's, police detective Jose Hidalgo, arrested her for killing three members of her family and Bellinger. During her jail time, Feral discovered she was infected with the [[Legacy Virus]]. She was either unable to be convicted or escaped, as she was next seen trying to obtain Isotope E (along with other virus sufferers) as a possible cure from the [[High Evolutionary]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}
[[Image:xforce90.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''X-Force'' #90 where Feral injures Siryn]]
Feral, now mentally distraught from her illness later resurfaced with a new incarnation of the [[Hellions]] led by [[King Bedlam]].  Although the team's criminal activities were limited to stealing the Armageddon Man to use him as a weapon, Feral left her mark.  All of the rage that she had felt for Siryn in the past boiled over in an argument where Feral sliced through Siryn's [[vocal cords]], incapacitating her powers.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

After being cured from the virus, Feral apparently had a change of heart.  She, as well as her sister Thornn, were recruited to be members of the [[Mumbai]] branch of the [[X-Corporation]] along with her former teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]. The team helped save [[Professor X]] from an [[assassination]] attempt by a crazed [[Lilandra Neramani]], who still believed that Charles Xavier was [[Cassandra Nova]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New X-Men&quot; #133&lt;/ref&gt;

She stayed with X-Corp for quite some time, but she returned to New York after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused the mutant [[gene]] to disappear from 90-95% of the mutant population worldwide, making them &quot;baseline humans&quot;. Both Feral and her sister were depowered and in [[District X|Mutant Town]], looking for answers.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

They both traveled to Wakanda where both sister met up with other feral heroes all of them animal in appearance such as [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. As a group, the four of them were to aid Wolverine in his search for his longtime foe [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. During the group’s investigation to find Sabretooth, both Feral and Thornn would be kidnapped by the enigmatic geneticist [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]], a 2,000 year old mutant. Romulus specializes in feral mutations preferring wolf-based entities such as individuals like Wolfsbane. Despite Feral and Thornn's cat-like exteriors, the girls would be put under extreme experiments that changed them on the genetic level.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

The sisters woke up and found that they were in a Weapon X experiment facility, and remembered nothing of the events that brought them there. Though not feeling any different except for their slight amnesia, they were more than surprised when they got up and looked at each other, the sisters realize that their bodies had been tampered with as they only saw their once mutant forms; cat-like in appearance. Whatever had been done to them had, in their beliefs, reversed their depowering and they were both mutants again.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

===Fighting Sabretooth===
Their memories however, began to slowly come back when Wolverine appeared. He was surprised to see their visages but gladly accepted the additional power that their mutant forms carried, should they wished to continue. Feral would choose to proceed, ecstatic in the chance to use her powers again. Now that Wolverine had finally found and secured the sisters he could continue his search for Sabretooth. The two would continue to search the facility they were in. With so many hallways and doors they inadvertently got separated. While alone, Feral stumbled upon Sabretooth. He was very different, more animalistic, even more so then normal. Confident in her skills, she willingly confronted him. In such close quarters and Sabretooth in his apparently mindless state, she would find the truth about her powers far too late. Sabretooth killed her. Wolverine would arrive right after Sabretooth had just killed her, too late to save her,&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' V3 #54&lt;/ref&gt; though he later killed Sabretooth, beheading him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Wolverine'' #54, [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the team regrouped. With Feral dead, it was then speculated by Wolfsbane that the sisters were still base-line humans. Only their outward appearances had been changed back to their once feline forms. Wolverine agreed, as it explained why she would have lost so easily. It would appear that Romulus only reverted their physical forms back to their previous mutant forms, without actually granting them their mutant powers. Feral's life would come full circle; she was murdered cold-blooded by a feral mutant in a berserker state as she in a similar state did too much of her family in her youth, many years prior.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Despite the fact that she had lost her powers prior to her death, Feral was resurrected and repowered by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], she took part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]], and was seen attacking X-23 and Dr. James Bradley.&lt;ref name =&quot;XFv3i21&quot;&gt;''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hassling Wolfsbane===
Later as Shatterstar and Wolfsbane defeated a demon, calling itself a Sin-Eater, at a local church, the two are about to leave when Feral was waiting outside the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Factor 3rd series #220&quot;&gt;''X-Factor'' (3rd series) #220 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Feral wants to get Wolfsbane’s unborn baby for herself. The motive is not clear, however, she doesn't care if she has to rip it off from the cold dead body of Rahne Sinclair. Feral’s attack does not go as planned because she passes through Wolfsbane's body.  Feral thinks Shatterstar did something to her. As they speak, Rahne reminds her that she is dead. She comments about the way it happened since she was present there when it happened. However, Feral does not believe it but feels something is wrong about herself. As she pauses to collect her thoughts, she realizes that she is dead. She vanishes and later materializes, with her memories intact in the taxi Rahne and Shatterstar are riding, as they are being chased by their enemies.  She reveals that there are many supernatural entities, specifically animal-type gods with dog and cat forms, now after Rahne's hybrid unborn baby. They are using Maria's spirit as a homing beacon on Rahne as she was once part of the human world when she was still alive, with the promise that they will reward her service to them by fully resurrecting her.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Factor 3rd series #221&quot;&gt;''X-Factor'' (3rd series) #221 (Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
She formerly had a feline mutation that endowed her with a thin layer of light orange fur covering her body, sharp claws and fangs, pointed ears, superhumanly acute senses including night vision and sense of smell, enhanced strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance paired with enhanced healing capabilities as well as a [[prehensile]] tail.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} Feral was depowered during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=June 2011}} She was repowered when she was briefly resurrected during [[Necrosha]].{{issue|date=November 2012}}

'''Joan Ferguson''' is a fictional character in the Australian television series ''[[Wentworth (TV series)|Wentworth]],'' who serves as the main antagonist from season two onwards. Joan is portrayed by actress [[Pamela Rabe]]. ''''Joan’s notable storylines is her one-sided feuds with [[Will Jackson (Wentworth)|Will Jackson]] and Matthew Fletcher. She is made the new governor of Wentworth after Erica Davidson is fired. The second series follows her turning Will Jackson and Matthew Fletcher against each other as well as replacing Franky Doyle with Bea Smith as top dog. After Bea becomes top dog, she turns against Joan and in the third season, their fight for power over the prison as well as Joan's vendetta against Will Jackson leads Joan to be arrested. In the fourth season, Joan returns as a prisoner of Wentworth, where she befriends Kaz in the hopes of taking out Nils Jesper, her former hitman who is testifying against her, and securing her release from prison.''''

During her time as both governor and prisoner, Joan is known for creating many conficts within Wentworth prison and its inmates. She is notable for killing Simmo Slater and staging as an overdose as well as attempting to murder Matt Fletcher. In the third season, she tortured Jodie Spiteri and had Bea drugged to stop her from exposing her as well as framing Will Jackson for the murder of Bea's ex-husband, Harry Smith. She also murdered Jess Warner and set the prison on fire to cover her tracks whilst her henchman also tried to have Fletcher killed again. In the fourth season, she manipulated Kaz Proctor into helping her murder Bea in revenge for Bea informing the police of Kaz's group, the Red Right Hand. This was foiled when Kaz found out it was Joan who called the police and revealed her identity to them and made it look like Bea. Afterwards, she used her knowledge of officer Jake Stewart's drug ring to have him kill Nils Jesper and help her hotshot Allie Novak, which led her to have no witnesses and her case dropped. Whilst walking free, Bea ambushed her in revenge for her attack on Allie and stabbed herself to make it look like Joan had killed her. The fifth season follows her second time being incarcarated and trying again to secure her release whilst the other inmates, including Franky Doyle, are out for revenge on her murder of Bea.

==Creation==
FremantleMedia Director of Drama Jo Porter said “Prisoner offered up a very rich well of amazing characters to draw upon and the Wentworth writers are very excited about revisiting the character of prison officer Joan ‘The Freak’ Ferguson in our second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/07/who-will-play-the-freak.html|title=Who will play The Freak?|work=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then announced that Pamela Rabe was going to portray Joan. It was said “In reviving the role of Joan Ferguson, Rabe adds to Wentworth‘s stellar cast and will undoubtedly add new layers to an imposing character…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/pamela-rabe-revives-the-freak-on-wentworth.html|title=Pamela Rabe revives The Freak on Wentworth|work=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
The Wentworth website states “Joan’s strength is her determination to succeed against the odds. She found a career in corrections and started as an officer. Her no-nonsense attitude won her fans in high places and she was fast-tracked to Deputy Governor of Queensland’s most troublesome prison, Blackmoore.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohotv.com.au/character/wentworth-joan-ferguson/|title=Joan Ferguson Character Profile|work=Wentworth Home Page|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
In a Joan centric episode, “The Fixer”, we see that Joan worked in a different prison, and was having a relationship with one of the inmates, Jianna. Jianna's baby was taken away from her, and Joan blamed Will Jackson, then a [[Will Jackson (Wentworth)|social worker]], for Jianna’s death. Joan wasn’t aware that, because of their relationship, Jianna was, in fact, killed by the other prisoners.&lt;ref name=2.9&gt;Episode 19: The Fixer&lt;/ref&gt;

As punishment for Franky’s drug trade, Ferguson makes the inmates watch as she bulldozes the whole garden project.

In the midst of Bea’s escape, Fletch finds out from Bryant that Joan assaulted Kelly to keep her quiet on her relationship with Jianna Butler. Fletch confronts Joan, along with the knowledge that she invaded his house and has a vendetta against Will, since he was the social worker that took Jianna's baby away. To keep him quiet, she has Fletch run down outside of Will's house.

Ferguson then demands answers from Doreen, [[Maxine Conway]], Franky and other prisoners as to information where Bea went. Joan later makes out that Bea and Will were complicit and planned the escape. She has Vera affirm this accusation since she has the knowledge that Vera euthanized her sick mother. When Bea returns she addresses Joan as &quot;Freak&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Episode 22: Fear Her&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan visits Fletch and when she learns that Vera has been going to see him behind her back, she calls her trust in Vera into question.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 26: Righteous Acts&lt;/ref&gt;

Jodie makes an abuse complaint against Ferguson which blindsides her. Joan isn’t happy when Derek can’t quash the complaint as it had been made directly to the ombudsman. When realising that Bea had a hand in the complaint, she gets her henchman to drug Bea and drag her into the exercise yard through the tunnels. Without Bea at her hearing, Jodie fumbles and is sent to the psych unit &lt;ref&gt;Episode 28: Evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan has Bea put in the psych unit when Bea's behavior in the exercise yard is mistaken as a psychotic episode. Joan forces Bea say it was a mental breakdown to get Bea out of the psych unit.

In the third season finale, Joan finds the walls closing in on her. She plants a recording device in the secure spot where Kaz Proctor reveals to Bea the name of Joan's henchman is Nils Jesper.

Joan leads Tasha to the shower, where Tasha pushes the panic button to stop her from being raped. Joan convinces Kaz to stop Maxine from punishing Tasha but Maxine lets Tasha off.

Joan comforts Tasha and saves her life when Tasha tries to kill herself. Joan later discovers that Bea is to be a witness at her trial. Joan then tells Kaz that Nils Jesper is working with Bea to keep Joan in prison. Joan is then seen witnessing Allie and Bea kiss in the kitchen. After Kaz is sentenced to 12 years in prison, Joan offers to kill Bea if Kaz uses her contacts on the outside to kill Nils.

Joan then receives roofies from Tina's Asian crew, testing the tablets out for herself. As Maxine goes for her breast cancer treatment, Joan manipulates Boomer into believing that Vera didn't offer to let Boomer come with Maxine to prison. This causes Boomer to get angry at Vera, leading her to be slotted. With Boomer and Maxine out of the way, Joan has Kaz cause a fight with Bea while she slips the drugs into Bea's drink. While Bea goes to the kitchen to meet with Allie, Kaz takes Allie and the other women to make a stand for Maxine departing alone. Joan uses this distraction to have Bea immobolized by the drugs and attempts to drown her. Meannwhile, Will Jackson finds the phone call that put Kaz Proctor away and it is revealed that it was actually Joan who made the call, claiming to be an inmate at Wentworth so as to plot the idea that Bea Smith called Kaz. Will shows Kaz the phone call, leading Kaz to angrily fight her and put her arm in the fryer. Bea is then resuscitated afterwards.

After going to hospital, Joan is moved into protection under medical until her trial. She meets with Shane Butler to gain his trust. Joan makes conversation with Jake about Vera. Joan convinces Shane that she is innocent and asks him to kill Nils Jesper. After witnessing Jake dealing drugs with Allie and being under stress when drugs are found in Tina's cell, Joan confronts Jake about his job as a drug dealer. Joan offers to pay him the money he owes if he kills Nils and helps her kill Allie. At the end of the episode, Allie is in the shower by herself when Joan appears behind the mirror, holds her down and injects heroin into her neck, staging a drug overdose.

Before her trial, Joan confronts Bea about Allie, calling her &quot;collateral damage.&quot; Although Franky manages to stop Shane from killing Nils, Jake hijacks Nils van and shoots him, setting the van on fire. Joan's charges are dropped and she is released. On her way out, she is confronted by Bea, who plans to kill her due to the attack on Allie. Joan overpowers Bea and takes hold of her knife. Bea then thrusts herself into the knife, making it appear that Joan has killed her.

===Season Five===
Joan is put in the isolation unit of Wentworth following Bea's death. She is then released into the general population at the same time as Allie comes back from the hospital following her overdose. In the exercise yard, Allie and a number of different inmates attack Joan. Joan fights back and proves victorious, snapping an inmates arm and strangling Allie just as she had done to Jess, scaring the other inmates. She believes that Vera was trying to help Bea kill her and conveys this to her lawyer, Jake and Vera herself. Since this is true, Vera makes it appear that Bea had used another officer's card to escape and kill Joan, infuriating her.

==Reception==
Joan Ferguson has been described as “arguably the biggest villain within the Wentworth walls.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/wentworths-pamela-rabe-people-squeal-when-they-see-me-off-set/news-story/97629540783eff4c125166e594bdc55a|title=Wentworth’s Pamela Rabe &quot;people squeal when they see me off set&quot;|work=News.com.au|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gay Times]]'' described Ferguson as a “formidable governor”, they also said “Straight edged, hair back and a stern face, Joan Ferguson is a force to be reckoned with”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/8687/chat-wentworths-formidable-governor-aka-pamela-rabe/|title=We chat to Wentworth’s most formidable governor aka Pamela Rabe|work=[[Gay Times]]|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reveal Magazine'' billed Joan as “The dreaded Joan Ferguson” when talking about the episode Born Again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reveal.co.uk/lifestyle/news/a594250/wednesdays-tv-pick-wentworth-prison.html|title=Wednesday's TV pick: Wentworth Prison|work=Reveal Magazine|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Metro'' said, &quot;Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson isn't just the most terrifying character in all prison dramas - she's the baddest and most sinister baddie ever to grace TV.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/07/22/10-reasons-wentworth-prison-is-better-than-orange-is-the-new-black-5307336/|title=10 reasons why Wentworth Prison is better than Orange Is The New Black|work=Metro|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Rabe was nominated for a [[Logie Awards of 2016|Logie Award]] in the category &quot;Most Outstanding Actress&quot; for her portrayal of Joan Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/shows/tv-buzz/a/31244589/2016-logie-nominations-announced/|title=2016 Logie nominations announced|work=Yahoo|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graeme Blundell of the Australian wrote &quot;So much awe surrounds Ferguson that she seems to possess supernatural powers, a Hannibal Lecter-like superhuman cunning and lack of empathy, though Rabe, a performer of unerring grace and authenticity, is such an accomplished actress she avoids the melodrama, turning Ferguson into one of the most believable villains we’ve seen on the local screen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/wentworth-prison-drama-with-pamela-rabe-returns-for-fifth-season/news-story/85e364fd322ad226eece65e860d13670&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Fisk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[criminal]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the son of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and his wife [[Vanessa Fisk]]. Although he was originally a [[villain]], he became an [[antihero]].

The character first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83 (April 1970) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]]

==Publication history==
The character Richard Fisk first appears as '''The Schemer''' in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #83 (April 1970), created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]] He first appeared as '''The Rose''' in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253 (June 1984), but was not revealed as the Rose until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286 (March 1987).&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Richard Fisk grew up as a child of privilege, believing that his father Wilson Fisk was a respectable and honorable businessman. Wilson was sometimes abusive to Richard, but Richard still loved him. At one point he and his childhood friend [[Samuel Silke]] saw Wilson roughing up someone. It was when he was attending a prestigious college in [[Switzerland]] that he discovered that his father was, in reality, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] of Crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #29&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the luxuries of his youth had been financed by a criminal empire, Richard was distraught and vowed to make atonement for his father's crimes. When his parents received word that Richard had perished in a skiing accident, they suspected that it was really a suicide after Richard learned the truth of his father's identity. Heartbroken and furious that his son could have acted so spinelessly, the Kingpin sunk into a spell of depression.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

===Schemer===
[[File:Schemer.png|175px|thumb|left|Cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83. Art by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]
Not long afterward, a new gang emerged in New York, led by a mysterious figure calling himself the '''Schemer'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most gangs in New York, the Schemer's organization seemed bent solely on dismantling the Kingpin's empire. After a series of confrontations, the Kingpin and the Schemer finally met face to face. It was then that the Schemer revealed that his face was really a mask, and that his true face was that of Richard Fisk. Richard explained that he had faked his death in the Alps and was striking back at his father using his own money. This final shock was too much for the Kingpin to bear, and he collapsed into [[catatonia]]. This finally made Richard realize how much he had hurt his father, and he set off to find a way to cure his comatose state. Richard joined the international [[terrorism|terrorist]] group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], becoming a leader of the Nevada fragment of HYDRA and eventually rising to the rank of Supreme Hydra. Now with HYDRA's expansive medical resources at his disposal, Richard was able to return his father to full health. The Kingpin, reconciled with his son, proved that he was back to normal by clandestinely taking over as ruler of HYDRA. However, it was soon revealed that the true leader of HYDRA was the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]], and the Fisks had to team up with [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to stop the mad dictator. Richard was critically wounded in the final battle, and the Kingpin had his son placed in [[suspended animation]], finally curing him by siphoning some life force from [[Spider-Man]].

===Rose===
Several years later, Richard joined his father's organization, calling himself the '''[[Rose (Marvel Comics)|Rose]]''', a crime lord under the Kingpin's control. However, this was all a ruse to undermine the Kingpin's empire from within. Aiding Richard in this scheme were his good friend Alfredo Morelli and [[Ned Leeds]], who was brainwashed to act as the supervillain the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. However, the Rose's subterfuge resulted in an explosive gang war that tore New York City apart. During a shoot-out Richard shot and killed a police officer, an act that became a turning point for him - no longer could he consider himself morally superior to his father. After Leeds' death and the end of the gang war, Richard resigned himself to his birthright and rejoined the Kingpin's organization as himself. However, the desire to overthrow his father once again arose, and Richard and Alfredo plotted to make the Kingpin think that Richard was ready to inherit his father's position. Alfredo had plastic surgery to make himself look just like Richard (since he had more combat experience), and slowly began climbing the ladder of power. However, when the Kingpin was overthrown by the combined forces of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and HYDRA, Alfredo betrayed his old friend by maintaining that he was truly Richard, and took over as the new Kingpin. Richard then became '''Blood Rose''', a [[Punisher]]-like [[vigilante]], and began gunning down criminals in a bloody purge of the city. The Blood Rose even shot and wounded Alfredo, who later returned under the alias of Gauntlet, although he was ultimately defeated by [[Nightwatch (comics)|NightWatch]] and incarcerated. Finally caught by Spider-Man and arrested, Richard entered the Witness Protection Program.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253-286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Coup===
Years later, Wilson Fisk once again regained the mantle of the Kingpin, and Richard re-emerged to public life and rejoined the Kingpin's organization, once again vowing to never again attempt to overthrow his father. However, upon meeting his old childhood friend, the ambitious enforcer Silke, Richard thought that he at last had found the perfect way to make his father pay for his crimes. Silke's assassination attempt nearly did succeed, stabbing and seriously wounding the Kingpin (already blinded from an earlier attempt on his life). However, Richard did not count on the tenacity of his mother, Vanessa. Vanessa quickly made a startling counter-strike, eliminating the rebellion and selling her husband's territory so he could travel to [[Europe]] and recover. Richard cornered her, insisting that by getting rid of the Kingpin they could be free to have a new life, but Vanessa coldly shot her son dead, eliminating him as a threat once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Richard Fisk has no superhuman powers, however he is trained in the use of guns and has some martial arts training. He is highly intelligent and also has a number of criminal contacts. As the Rose he wears a bulletproof three-piece suit. He always carries a handgun and often a variety of mini-grenades as well.

==Other versions==
Another version of Richard Fisk appeared in [[PunisherMAX]]'s first story arc called &quot;Kingpin&quot;. Here, he is depicted as an eight-year-old child rather than a young adult, and his death is caused by his father's takeover of the mob. During his final confrontation with Fisk, mob boss Rigoletto takes Richard hostage and threatens to kill him but Fisk, showing no concern for his son's fate, stands idly by as Rigoletto slits the boy's throat. Fisk later reflects that he had always thought that he was trying to advance his criminal career for his son's sake, while in reality it was only for himself. Richard's fate causes Vanessa Fisk to plot the downfall of her estranged husband.&lt;ref&gt;''PunisherMax'' #1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RichardFisk.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Richard Fisk (left) and Tombstone (right) as seen in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: Animated Series]]'' episode &quot;Guilty.&quot;]]
Richard Fisk appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Nick Jameson]]. In this continuity, Richard is loyal to his father and heads a [[front company]] called Fisktronics. In the two-part episode &quot;Framed&quot; and &quot;The Man Without Fear,&quot; Wilson Fisk hires Peter Parker to work for Fisktronics under Richard Fisk. Richard frames Peter Parker for selling government secrets with the help of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. Spider-Man and Daredevil successfully team up to clear Parker's name, which results in Fisk's arrest and conviction, in part due to his father's machinations. In the episode &quot;Guilty,&quot; Richard teams up with [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], who is incarcerated in the same prison, to frame Robbie Robertson. Fisk makes his final appearance in &quot;The Prowler&quot; in a flashback appearance when he is saved by [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown]].

'''Vanessa Fisk''' is a fictional comic book character appearing in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. As the wife of mobster Wilson Fisk, the so-called [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]], and the mother of [[Richard Fisk]], she appears as a supporting character in stories featuring those villains, usually those starring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].

The character has appeared in media adaptations, including the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Ayelet Zurer]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita, Sr.]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #70 (March 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about Vanessa Fisk's personal life and early years. No maiden name has ever been revealed. As the wife of [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], the &quot;Kingpin&quot; of New York's criminal underworld, Vanessa did not approve of her husband's criminal activities. At one point their son [[Richard Fisk]] became involved in a plot to overthrow his father's criminal syndicate after discovering he was the Kingpin.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

After the Kingpin had a near-death experience, Vanessa gave him an ultimatum; he had twenty-four hours to get out of crime, or she would leave him. The Kingpin was about to kill Spider-Man when the deadline passed, and Vanessa forced him to choose between Spider-Man's life or their life together. He chose his wife and spared Spider-Man as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #197. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

The two went into retirement in Japan. Kingpin prepared to settle his remaining business with his fellow mobsters by cooperating with the authorities and leaving the world of crime forever. This infuriated one of Kingpin's closest advisors, Lynch, who believed that Vanessa was a liability and had turned the once mighty Kingpin into a henpecked husband. When Fisk's former lieutenants in New York caught wind of his plans to sell them out in exchange for immunity, they kidnapped Vanessa, who was in town to secure the legal services of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #170. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisk started a gang war against the mob in New York to rescue his wife. The mob bosses attempted to ransom Vanessa off in exchange for the evidence against them Fisk had intended to turn over to the authorities, but during the exchange, Kingpin used a sonic device to stop the criminals, and found her bound and gagged in a building. However Lynch fired an explosive at Vanessa, in an attempt to deprive Fisk of the thing that kept him retired and bring him back as the Kingpin of Crime. However, she was buried alive in the rubble and presumed dead, although she did not actually die.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #171. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; As planned, this drove Kingpin back into the world of crime, although he found out Lynch was behind the explosion, partially due to a headache he gained, and took revenge by murdering his traitorous advisor. He then forced the remaining mob leaders to confess to hiring the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill several of Fisk's men.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #172. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks later, Matt Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], found Vanessa in the sewers. Being buried alive had left Vanessa amnesiac and mentally unstable, and she ended up taken in by a grotesque mutant who lived in the sewers. Daredevil ultimately used her as leverage to force Kingpin to order his puppet Randolph Cherryh, newly elected to the office of mayor, to resign and to confirm to the media that he was indeed a mob puppet. After reuniting with her, Kingpin had his now catatonic wife shipped off to a sanitarium in Europe in order to have her regain her sanity. This would take years, as Vanessa's husband's organized crime empire would fall and be rebuilt during the period that Vanessa was institutionalized.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Ultimately Vanessa would recover, and she would remain in Europe. But when her husband was the victim of an assassination attempt orchestrated by her son, Vanessa arranged for her husband to be shipped out of the country to recover from his injuries, and to cut a deal with his fellow mob bosses to divide up Fisk's recently rebuilt crime syndicate in exchange for a truce. Vanessa then took the final, brutal step of personally murdering her own devoted son, who admitted to Vanessa that his motivation was to rid the family of his father, who he blamed for his family's troubles.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The act of murdering her own beloved son caused a horrific physical toll on Vanessa, causing her to slowly lose the will to live, which along with the injuries she sustained when she was buried alive, culminated in her body undergoing terminal organ failure. Blaming both her husband and Matt Murdock, who had recently been revealed to be Daredevil, for the endless cycle of violence that had consumed her family, Vanessa faked the death of Foggy Nelson in an attempt to provoke Murdock into killing Fisk while they were both in prison. When that failed, she manipulated the super-hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] into posing as Daredevil, which ultimately drove Matt to break out of prison to find Foggy's murderer and the identity of the man impersonating him, culminating in her confronting Matt with an offer to clear his name in exchange for him clearing Kingpin, so that the two would be free to try and kill each other anew.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #92. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Daredevil refused this deal, Vanessa went ahead and arranged for the murder of Leland Drummond, the corrupt [[FBI]] director who outed Matt in order to advance his own career within the FBI. To discredit his outing of Daredevil, the murder was made to look like a suicide and a false and highly damning suicide note was planted at the scene, claiming that Drummond took his own life after it became apparent that his scheme to frame Matt Murdock was about to be exposed. Shortly afterwards, Vanessa died and Murdock found himself morally guilted into serving as the Kingpin's lawyer, getting the charges dropped on the grounds that the evidence was too tainted to bring him to court. But Daredevil would exact his own form of Faustian bargain with Kingpin, as he forced the crime boss to renounce his American citizenship and leave the country forever in exchange for his nemesis's legal services, stating that any attempt to continue their vendetta would be an insult to the memory of the good woman Vanessa had once been.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #93. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Fisk is later seen at her grave where he breaks down emotionally. She has since been talking to Wilson as a ghostly vision taunting him that he will never regain his former glory, an indication that her death still greatly affects him.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The Arbiters bring Vanessa back as a [[revenant]] as apart of a test intended to gauge the Kingpin's worth as the head of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #7|date = 17 July 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt; Reluctant to combat his wife, Fisk tries to appeal to whatever humanity that she may still have left in her, and kills her when she still flings her weapons at him, unaware that she was actually aiming at the assassin who was approaching him from behind.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = 18 September 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] &quot;reanimates&quot; Vanessa in an attempt to coerce the Kingpin into allying with him in ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]''.

==Other versions==
In the Marvel/DC crossover book ''[[Batman &amp; Spider-Man: New Age Dawning]] #1'', Vanessa is infected with terminal cancer by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who offers the Kingpin the cure for it in exchange for his help in a plot that will destroy New York. Disgruntled under Ra's, the Kingpin forms an alliance with Spider-Man and [[Batman]] and succeeds in defeating Ra's, only to be denied the cure for his wife's cancer by the beaten eco-terrorist. Vanessa is cured near the end of the storyline by an antidote provided by Ra's al Ghul's daughter [[Talia al Ghul]], who recognizes Vanessa as a kindred spirit, as both of them loved a man that society would regard as a monster.

In the alternate universe of ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', it is revealed that she was not infected or eaten when the zombies took over the world. but has been secretly kept alive by her zombified husband, who is able to control his hunger for human flesh when she is around, but when the Kingpin's clone factory is destroyed by [[Machine Man]], and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], he consumes Vanessa.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2 (2008). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanessa Fisk appears as an important background character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. The Kingpin seeks the [[Tablet of Time]], as it alleged to have powers that Kingpin hopes may awaken Vanessa from a coma. but it is stolen by the [[Black Cat (comics)#Ultimate Black Cat|Black Cat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p). ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #50 and 53. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after Kingpin sets fire to Daredevil's law office, Daredevil breaks into Fisk's home and threatens to murder the comatose Vanessa, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Fisk orders Vanessa to be taken out of the country before he is arrested himself over the attempted murder of [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #110. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Punisher Max]]'' series, set in Marvel's [[Max (comics)|MAX]] universe, Vanessa is married to the Kingpin, but their marriage collapses as Wilson Fisk's takeover of the mob causes the death of their eight-year-old son Richard.

Later, in order to protect himself from [[Punisher|the Punisher]], Kingpin hires [[Elektra (comics)#PunisherMax|Elektra]] as a bodyguard.

After the Kingpin is killed by the Punisher in issue #21, Vanessa has his body cremated and flushes his ashes down a toilet. She appears ready to take charge of her husband's former empire, as her chauffeur calls her &quot;Madam Kingpin&quot;. But in issue #22, she is ambushed and killed by [[Nick Fury]].

== Development ==

=== Casting ===
Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html|title=Ginger Snaps|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2001|work=salon.com|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''What Culture'' said:

: &quot;Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when shes bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Gingers humanity and her animalistic side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-badass-female-horror-villains?page=5|title=10 Badass Female Horror Villains|last=|first=|date=|website=What Culture|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Roakes of ''The Toast'' also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying &quot;Ginger’s body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenant of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2014/10/29/ginger-snaps-menstrual-horror-movie-dreams/|title=Ginger Snaps: The Menstrual Horror Movie Of Your Dreams|last=|first=|date=|website=The Toast|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trevor Fitzroy''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]], in particular [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #281 (October 1991).

Fitzroy hails from the same [[dystopia]]n future as Bishop. A mutant criminal, he possesses the ability to absorb energy from human beings and use that energy to open [[time travel|time portals]], which is how Bishop traveled to the present. He has since been featured as the main adversary in the series featuring Bishop.

==Fictional character biography==
===The future===
Trevor Fitzroy was the illegitimate son of Anthony Shaw, Black King of [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], in a dystopian future. Fitzroy joined the '''Academy for [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]]''' (XSE) and had a relationship with [[Shard (comics)|Shard]]. He turned out to be a criminal, though, and was removed from the Academy. His wealthy father tried to protect his son for a while, but when Fitzroy was caught for murder, even he could no longer protect him. Fitzroy was captured and arrested by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], Shard's brother and an XSE officer. 

Fitzroy himself thought that he was merely a teleporter, but a secret group of XSE agents, known as the '''Xavier's Underground Enforcers''' (XUE) discovered that Fitzroy had the ability to travel through time. The XUE recruited Shard and freed Fitzroy, hoping to use his powers to change the past to create a better present.  However, Shard, reminded how dangreous Fitzroy was, stopped them and Fitzroy was returned to prison.

===The Upstarts===
From prison, Fitzroy escaped to the present time with his mutant minion [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]]. There, he became involved with a group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a competition set up by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] to eliminate her rivals within the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Led by the Gamesmaster, the Upstarts had to kill other mutants to receive points. The Upstart with the most points would win the prize: control over the Hellfire Club and the other competitors. To enter the competition, one had to kill a member of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle (though later members didn't have to.) 
As part of this “game,” Fitzroy unleashed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and their leader [[Donald Pierce]]. All were killed except Pierce, who escaped and arrived at the Hellfire Club, followed by the Sentinels. The Sentinels killed Pierce (later rebuilt) and then killed most of the [[Hellions]], put their leader, [[Emma Frost]], into a coma and apparently killed Jean Grey (who had actually switched her mind with Frost). The [[X-Men]], who had been negotiating with Frost, fought Fitzroy. Fitzroy was forced to open a large time portal, allowing prisoners from his own time to escape to the present. The prisoners attacked the X-Men, but stopped when three figures stepped through the portal: Bishop and fellow XSE agents Randall and Malcolm. They went after Fitzroy, eventually killing the escaped criminals. However, Malcolm and Randall were killed, and Bishop remained in the present, joining the X-Men.

Fitzroy turned on Selene and captured her, though she later managed to escape. He also brought in [[Siena Blaze]] to compete in the Upstart competition. Fitzroy clashed with the X-Men a second time when he tried to kill [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], but managed to escape again. When the Gamesmaster declared that the new target for the Upstart competition would be former members of the [[New Mutants]] and Hellions, Fitzroy attacked [[X-Force]], demanding they turn over [[Rictor]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. X-Force leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tricked Fitzroy into trying to absorb his life-energy, but as Cable's arm wasn't organic, Fitzroy's powers used his own life-energy to open a portal, seemingly killing him.

===After the Upstarts===
How he survived its left unknown, but Fitzroy eventually reappeared under the thrall of Selene as the White Rook of the Hellfire Club. During this time he cooperates with Pierce and Shaw, despite his previous attempts to kill them. He leaves the Club and travels back to an alternate future (Earth-9910), now calling himself the '''Chronomancer'''. He takes control over this new timeline, but Bishop arrives and fights Fitzroy, eventually killing him.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===X-Factor===
A younger version appears that is a participant in the Summers Rebellion. Here, he is shown to be a good guy. After Cortex kills him during a fight, [[Layla Miller]] resurrects him physically but is unable to revive him with a soul, establishing the point at which he becomes a villain.&lt;ref&gt;X-Factor' vol.3 #46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Fitzroy possessed the mutant ability to drain others of their life forces, converting it into energy and absorbing it into himself. With these energies, Fitzroy could create portals that could teleport those passing through them across time and space, yet, the portals are one way, trying to pass through the wrong way results in the traveler having his body terribly misshapen. He often was dependent on the mutant Bantam to direct and catalog the time-portals he made, lacking the ability to do so himself.

Fitzroy also can use the converted life force he drains to infuse on the dead that essentially resurrect them, however due to his nature, its an ability he rarely uses.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' (1st series) #17&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early appearances, Fitzroy wears a futuristic battle-armor that increases his strength and protects him from opponents. This battle armor was destroyed by the X-Men and a second suit of armor was destroyed by X-Force.
Fitzroy also had several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obeyed his commands. These Sentinels were smaller than the 20th century type, but had the ability to repair themselves using material from their near vicinity.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Trevor Fitzroy &amp; Bantam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trever Fitzroy and Bantam from [[X-Men Animated Series]]]]
Fitzroy was a guest-star in the two-part episode &quot;One Man's Worth&quot; of the episodes of the mid-’90s [[X-Men animated series|''X-Men'' animated series]]. Fitzroy, known as &quot;the Mutant Traitor&quot;, under the orders of [[Master Mold]], travels back in time to 1959 to murder Charles Xavier. In the cartoon, he does not kill those whose energy he absorbs, but knocks them unconscious for a few days.

===Video Games===
Fitzroy was one of the bosses in ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy]]''.  Defeating him allows [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to be a playable character.

'''James Ford''', better known by the alias &quot;'''Sawyer'''&quot; and later as &quot;'''Jim LaFleur'''&quot;, is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Josh Holloway]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.

Sawyer was born on 18 February 1968; he was initially portrayed as a conniving, sarcastic handsome flirt who keeps stashes of washed-ashore items. His flashbacks typically depict a more sensitive side to him, juxtaposed against acts of betrayal and theft. He has a romantic interest in the fugitive [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]), and the two fall in love over the series. Their relationship is particularly prominent in the beginning of the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]] he develops a more heroic side, becoming protective of [[Claire Littleton]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and sacrificing his chance to escape so his friends can in the [[There's No Place Like Home|season finale]]. In the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]], Sawyer quickly acclimates to his new role as group leader as they are sent back through time, and after being without Kate for three years, falls in love with [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]), creating a love triangle when Kate returns to the island. Sawyer is the show's primary [[anti-hero]].

==Character biography==

===Prior to the crash===
Sawyer was born in [[Jasper, Alabama]] in 1968 as James Ford. When James was nine years old, his parents were conned by a man under the alias of &quot;[[Characters of Lost#Anthony Cooper|Tom Sawyer]]&quot;; as a result, his father killed both his mother and himself.  On the day of the funeral, [[Characters of Lost#Jacob|Jacob]] expresses his condolences to Sawyer, even as he is writing his 'I am going to find you' letter for the conman who took his family. At the time of his parents' death, James and his family were living in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] according to the letter Sawyer carries. James also claims to have dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but has a &quot;high school transcript.&quot; A major driving force in James' life is his vow to avenge his parents' deaths by hunting down the original Sawyer; as an adult, when he found himself in financial difficulty, he adopted the profession and alias of the man responsible for his parents' death, using his looks and charm to seduce wealthy married women, thus he &quot;became the man he was hunting.&quot; One of his scams involved waking up next to his victim and pretending to be late for an important meeting; as he rushes to get ready, his briefcase will &quot;accidentally&quot; spill open, revealing bundles of cash the woman &quot;wasn't supposed to see.&quot; With her interest piqued, he convinces her and her spouse to invest cash in a legally questionable, but supposedly lucrative business opportunity, before disappearing with the money. On one occasion, he runs this con up until he discovers the targeted couple has a child, experiences an attack of conscience and cancels the deal.

On another occasion, Sawyer carries out a &quot;[[Confidence trick|Long con]]&quot; (large-scale con) on a divorced woman named [[Characters of Lost#Cassidy Phillips|Cassidy]] who is known to be less gullible than his usual victims. He sets up the usual con and spills his cash over the ground, only this time with fake bank notes. Cassidy realizes he's trying to con her from the moment he spills the money, and tells him  his con wouldn't have worked  because she received no money after the divorce. Instead of being mad, however, she asks him to teach her his profession. After learning a few basic tricks, Cassidy soon asks Sawyer to pull off a long con. He tells her such a con requires money, and she reveals she actually received $600,000 from her ex-husband. He pretends to begin a long con, using her money to set it up, but in fact he simply plans to take the money. However, she has begun to grow on him, and he wavers on his con. While visiting the diner of [[Kate Austen|Kate]]'s mother, his partner (played by [[Kevin Dunn]]) forces Sawyer to resume his con on threat of death. He goes back to Cassidy and tells her that he has been conning her, and warns her of a car parked outside. He stuffs the money into a bag and tells her to leave with it, and he will take the blame. When she runs off, he takes the real money (having given her fake bank notes) and returns to the car, actually empty.

Cassidy presses charges against Sawyer for conning her, and he is sent to prison. Cassidy visits him and informs him they have a daughter, named Clementine. While in prison, Sawyer befriends a man named Munson, sentenced for a [[white-collar crime]]. On behalf of the police, he cons Munson into revealing where he hid the money he stole; as a result, Sawyer's sentence is cut short, and the monetary reward he receives is deposited in an anonymous bank account for Clementine at his request. Later, as Sawyer is seducing another woman, another partner (played by [[Robert Patrick]]) informs him of the whereabouts of the original Sawyer who conned his parents. Sawyer travels to [[Australia]] to confront the man, and shoots him. Before he dies, Sawyer realizes his partner had conned him into killing someone who owed money to an important person. Sawyer also encounters and drinks with [[Christian Shephard]] at a bar. While in Australia, Sawyer is arrested, at the same station visited by [[Boone Carlyle|Boone]], for assaulting [[Warren Truss]], an Australian politician and leader of the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]], during a bar fight. As a result, Sawyer is deported and banned from returning to Australia; he leaves on board [[Oceanic Flight 815]], his seat number being 15D.

===After the crash===

====Season One====

Upon crashing on the island, Sawyer almost instantly clashes with the other survivors. He initially accuses [[Sayid Jarrah|Sayid]] of being the terrorist who caused the crash. Despite this, he joins Sayid, along with [[Kate Austen|Kate]], [[Charlie Pace|Charlie]], [[Boone Carlyle|Boone]] and [[Shannon Rutherford|Shannon]] on a hike to send out a distress signal. Upon returning, Sawyer searches the plane wreck for anything and everything he can find and keeps them for himself, causing the other survivors to bargain with him for items. He and [[Jack Shephard|Jack]] clash over the attention of Kate on regular intervals. Kate claims to see through his attempts to make people hate him, until he shows her the letter he wrote but implies it was written to him by one of his victims; later she sees the date on the envelope and realizes he wrote the letter himself. After Jack is caught in a cave-in, Sawyer locates Kate in the jungle and eventually informs her. When Shannon experiences asthma attacks, Sawyer is immediately under suspicion of possessing her inhalers after Boone sees him with one of his belongings. After being interrogated by Sayid, he tells Kate that he doesn't have them, causing an enraged Sayid to stab him in the arm. Kate then confronts Sawyer regarding his selfish actions, and tells him to change his ways by cooperating more with the survivors.  He reluctantly agrees.

In the jungle, Sawyer and Kate discover a case, carried on the plane by the Marshall, and the two constantly fight over its ownership, until Jack takes it from Sawyer.  Soon after, Sawyer becomes constantly harassed by a boar, and seeks Kate's help in finding it. Upon cornering it, however, Sawyer decides to let it go. After learning about [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael]]'s plan to build a raft, Sawyer asks for a place on board, to which he is granted. However, after someone (later revealed as [[Walt Lloyd|Walt]]) sets the raft on fire, Sawyer and Michael blame [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin]] and Sawyer takes him to the beach with the intent of beating him. Once the matter is solved, Sawyer experiences headaches and, after consulting Jack, is prescribed reading glasses, made from pairs found in the wreckage. His voice also calms the newborn of survivor [[Claire Littleton|Claire]].

The day before the raft sets sail, Sawyer and Kate clash once more, this time over his place on the raft. While Kate placed a good argument, Sawyer revealed his past life as a criminal to the survivors, securing his space on the raft. The next day, Sawyer, Michael, Walt and Jin set sail on the raft. When a piece of the raft breaks off, Sawyer is the first in the water to retrieve and re-attach it. He also begins reading through the survivors' personal messages,  kept in a bottle. That night, they encounter a small boat and begin celebrating their rescue. However, they soon reveal themselves as the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], and demand they hand over Walt. In an attempt to prevent Walt's abduction, Sawyer is shot in the shoulder before the raft is destroyed by the Others, who leave with Walt.

====Season Two====
Sawyer and Michael are stranded at sea with the wreckage of the raft. Sawyer removes the bullet from his shoulder prior to arriving back on the island, encountering the tail section survivors from the plane and being thrown into a pit. Once the mishap is cleared, Sawyer, Michael and Jin are released and forced into leading them to the fuselage camp. Throughout the journey, Sawyer constantly clashes with leader [[Ana Lucia Cortez|Ana Lucia]], until he passes out from his bullet wound. He is then carried via hand-made stretcher until the death of Shannon, where he is carried by [[Mr. Eko]] into the hatch. He is cared for by Kate, until her father, Wayne, is channeled through Sawyer. Upon recovering, Sawyer reluctantly must seek Jack's medical expertise on a regular basis. 

On one such occasion, Sawyer releases Jack and Locke from the armory after Michael locks them in to search for Walt alone. Sawyer agrees to join them as they follow, only to encounter the Others. After revealing to have Kate held hostage, Sawyer, Jack and Locke reluctantly hand over their guns for her safety. Unlike Jack, Sawyer sympathizes with Kate's actions. Soon after, Sawyer sets up a long con, with the help of Charlie, in order to gain possession of the camp's entire firearms and medicine, using [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun]] as a victim of a faked abduction attempt. Upon succeeding this feat, Sawyer is challenged by Jack to a game of poker with the medicine as the prize, which Jack wins. Sawyer later gives Sun a pregnancy test upon request, and informs [[Bernard Nadler|Bernard]] and Jin about her suspected pregnancy.

Sawyer also uses his possession of the medicine to his advantage, and mocks [[Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes|Hurley]] when he admits to seeing things, only for his tirade to backfire. He also refuses to help Bernard create an S.O.S. sign on the beach. He is soon confronted by Ana Lucia, demanding he give her a gun. She seduces him, and steals his own gun from him. Upon discovering this, Sawyer, along with Jack, Locke and Kate, head for the hatch, where they discover Michael injured, [[Libby (Lost)|Libby]] fatally wounded and Ana Lucia already dead. Michael asks Sawyer if he will go with him to the Others' camp, to which he agrees. After the funeral of Ana Lucia and Libby, Sawyer joins Michael, Jack, Kate and Hurley on the trek, where they are suddenly ambushed by the Others, tied up and taken to a pier. While Michael (along with Walt) leave the island, and Hurley is released, Sawyer is taken away by the Others, along with Jack and Kate.

====Season Three====
Sawyer wakes in the Others' camp, imprisoned in a cage originally designed to hold polar bears. Karl, a teenager being held in the cage across from Sawyer's, helps Sawyer to figure out the mechanism in his cage so he can gain access to food and water. Karl then helps him to escape, but Juliet shoots Sawyer in the neck with a tranquilizer dart and he is returned to his cage. Karl is taken away, and Kate is placed in the cage vacated by Karl. Sawyer and Kate are forced to mine and haul rocks for the Others. During this manual labor, Sawyer kisses Kate, even though he gets beaten for it by Danny Pickett.  Pickett, one of the Others, dislikes Sawyer, blaming him for the death of his wife. 

Sawyer and Kate concoct an escape plan, but they are prevented from acting on it when Sawyer is knocked unconscious by Ben.  The Others operate on Sawyer, implanting a pacemaker which will malfunction and kill him if his heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute.  He is told if he does not cooperate, Kate will be given a pacemaker too.  Because of this, Sawyer does not defend himself when Pickett violently beats him up. Later, Sawyer nearly dies (supposedly) after Kate turns her back to him in her cage and starts undressing. Sawyer sees this and his pacemaker beats rapidly. Kate asks him what this sound is and Sawyer lies, saying that it is his watch and tells her to 'put some clothes on'. 

Kate realizes she can slip out between top bars of her cage, but Sawyer refuses to escape with her. Instead of fleeing on her own, she returns to her cage.  Later, Ben reveals to Sawyer that he has been conned, and there is no pacemaker in his heart.  Ben informs Sawyer they are on a smaller island, separated by a stretch of open ocean from the island on which their plane crashed. Sawyer realizes how inescapable the island is, and is returned to his cage.

Kate opens Sawyer's cell but Sawyer again refused to leave, knowing how futile it would be to try. They have sex, and while Ben is unconscious, having a tumor removed by Jack, Pickett takes the opportunity to finally kill Sawyer. However, Jack threatens to let Ben die unless Kate and Sawyer are released. Sawyer turns the tables on Pickett, beats him up, and he and Kate escape.  Alex Rousseau helps them hide in the jungle in return for freeing Karl (her boyfriend), and gives them a canoe to escape in. Right before they leave the beach, Pickett finally catches up with them, but is shot dead by Juliet, who Ben ordered to help them escape.

Back on the main island, Sawyer and Kate argue over his decision to leave Jack behind (and also to let Karl go free). At the survivors' camp, Sawyer keeps his distance from Kate and has a beer-fueled joyriding session with Hurley, Jin, and Charlie in an abandoned Dharma truck Hurley found in the jungle. Back at camp he discovers Kate has gone off with Sayid and Locke in order to rescue Jack. He and Hurley develop a friendship, often playing table tennis together.  Hurley surprises Sawyer by announcing with Jack, Locke, Kate, and Sayid gone, the rest of the survivors are looking to Sawyer to lead them. Sawyer rises to the challenge and bonds with the other survivors.  When Kate and Jack finally return, Sawyer is outraged they have brought Juliet along. He and Sayid attempt to get information on the Others out of her, but they ultimately fail. 

Sawyer resumes his relationship with Kate but suspects she is using him to make Jack jealous. One night Locke tells Sawyer that he has captured Ben, and takes Sawyer to the ''Black Rock'', locking him in a room with a bound and gagged stranger.  This man, not Ben, reveals  he is Anthony Cooper (Locke's father), a conman who also goes under the name &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot; Sawyer realizes this is the man whom he has been searching for and, after Cooper mocks his letter of vengeance, Sawyer strangles him to death in a fit of anger. With no more use for the nickname &quot;Sawyer,&quot; he begins to call himself James again, though others continue to refer to him as Sawyer. Locke presents him with a tape showing Juliet is still working for Ben, and the Others are preparing a raid on the survivors. When Sawyer shows the tape to Jack at their camp, Jack reveals he knows about the raid, and Juliet has been working with him to double-cross the Others. 

Sawyer and several survivors hike across the jungle to the radio tower, but Sayid, Jin, and Bernard stay behind to thwart the Others and end up captured.  Sawyer decides to go back with Juliet to rescue them.  With the help of Hurley and the Dharma truck, their rescue is a complete success. Two of the Others are killed and the third, Tom, is captured before Sawyer shoots him out of vengeance for 'taking the kid off the raft.'

====Season Four====
When Desmond breaks news about Charlie's death, Sawyer attempts to comfort Hurley, though his efforts are rejected. Although originally unsure of the meaning of Charlie's dying message, &quot;Not Penny's Boat,&quot; when the survivors split Sawyer chooses to go with Locke to the Barracks, telling Kate he was simply doing what he's always done: surviving. While holding Kate hostage in Ben's house on Locke's orders, Sawyer tells Kate he doesn't wish to return to the real world, seeing as he has nothing for him back there. He then proceeds to tell Kate she should do the same, and that they could try to start a life on the island. Kate and Sawyer sleep together but she leaves after Sawyer is relieved that she isn't pregnant, reasoning that they wouldn't be able to handle a baby. They have an argument and part on bad terms as Kate returns to the beach. Later on, a group of people from the boat arrive at the barracks to capture Ben. Ben, Locke, Hurley and Aaron take refuge in Ben's house and they barricade the door. Sawyer runs to retrieve Claire who is still sleeping alone in her house and watches in horror as it is blown up by the Freighters. He finds Claire alive under the ruins and proceeds to run back to Ben's house. After Alex is murdered by Keamy and Ben unleashes the smoke monster on the attackers, Sawyer decides to go back to Jack and the others on the beach. Claire, Aaron and Miles go with him. Hurley was going to go with Sawyer as well, but Locke, pointing a gun at Sawyer, forces Hugo to stay with him. After Sawyer warns Locke not to hurt &quot;a single hair on his [Hugo's] curly head,&quot; he leads the rest of the group back to the beach. 

Sawyer, Claire and Miles soon come across the bodies of Danielle and Karl. After leaving the area, they decide to settle down to make camp, however during the night Claire takes off into the jungle. Sawyer wakes up the following morning and Miles tells him Claire walked into the jungle in the middle of the night with someone she called &quot;Dad&quot;. A short while later he hears Aaron crying and runs off to find him alone in the jungle. Sawyer and Miles, along with Aaron, continue on where they meet Jack and Kate in a small field. Jack and Kate were in the process of moving towards the helicopter from the freighter, with Jack inadvertently thinking the dropped satellite phone from Frank was a message to follow the crew. Sawyer then informs Jack and Kate that Claire walked off and the freighter's crew are up to no good.  He hands Aaron over to Kate and tells her to go back to the beach with Miles and the infant, while he insists on going with Jack to face Charles Widmore's men.  The two then find the helicopter, discover Frank handcuffed to the seats, and are told the men are heading towards Ben. Sawyer then tells Jack that Hurley is with Ben and the two head off to rescue Hurley.

Jack and Sawyer eventually find Hurley and Locke at the [[Dharma_Initiative#Station_6:_The_Orchid|Dharma Orchid station]]. After Jack finishes talking with Locke, Sawyer and Hurley meet up with Kate, Sayid, and Frank at the helicopter. En route to the freighter Frank notices that the helicopter is quickly losing fuel due to a bullet hole in the gas tank. The passengers ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load, but Frank declares it will not be enough. Sawyer whispers something to Kate, he gives her a goodbye kiss, and he then bails out of the helicopter to give the others a chance of escape. Sawyer swims back to the Island and encounters Juliet, who directs his attention to smoke coming from the ruins of the freighter. As the two lie on the beach drinking rum they disappear with the vanished Island.

===After the Island===

After the [[Characters_of_Lost#Oceanic_Six|Oceanic Six]] (Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun, Sayid and Aaron) leave the Island, flashforwards in &quot;[[Something Nice Back Home]]&quot; reveal Kate is doing undisclosed favors for Sawyer, who, according to Jack, &quot;chose to stay on the island&quot;.

===Season Five===

====After the flash====

Before the strange flash, James and Juliet meet up with Charlotte, Miles, Rose, Bernard and the other 815 survivors and they discover  their camp is somehow missing. James is then introduced to [[Daniel Faraday]], who tells him the camps are not gone but that it hasn't been built yet and whatever Ben did in the Orchid station has made them constantly shift through time. They are in the past. The group set out to find a man-made landmark on the Island to determine where they are in time. After several more flashes, the team decide to head back to the beach. At the beach, they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows, resulting in several casualties. The group ultimately splits up, with James and Juliet heading toward the creek together. There they are attacked by three strangers.  They demand answers, and even threatens to cut off Juliet's hand to emphasize their impatience, when Locke arrives to kill one and injure the other two.  James, Juliet, and Locke question the two attackers and Juliet discover they are Others when they speak Latin to each other. They arrive at a camp where [[Others (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] is leading his people and he has Charlotte, Daniel and Miles held captive. The year is 1954. When an Other called [[Characters of Lost|Ellie]] takes Daniel at gunpoint to try to disarm a hydrogen bomb called Jughead, James holds a gun at her in order to rescue him. He then discovers Daniel had told Ellie  they are from the future and are not part of the American military which the Others had believed they were. Suddenly, there is yet another flash and the Others including Ellie and Richard disappear. James and the rest see Charlotte bleed from her nose and collapse.
[[File:WhateverHappenedLost.jpg|thumb]]
James watches as Juliet and Daniel attempt to wake up Charlotte, who eventually comes around.  James and Locke decide to head to the Orchid Station, believing a way to stop the jumps is there. When they return to the beach they discover the camp is back but has been abandoned and they also find a rowing boat on which they decide to use to get to the Orchid. However whilst rowing they are attacked by unknown assailants from behind - Juliet manages to shoot one of the attackers but before anything else can happen there is another flash.  The assailants are gone, and they are rowing in the rain. Later on, the team is reunited with Jin, last seen in [[There's No Place Like Home|the season four finale]], who is alive. Along with Jin the team then continue on to Orchid where the flashes become worse and becomes painful for all the castaways and not just Charlotte. James, Juliet and Miles get headaches and bleeding noses but it becomes too much for Charlotte who once again falls to the ground. The shifts are slowly but surely killing them. Daniel decides to stay behind with her and the rest continue to the Orchid. They arrive to find only a well, which evidently leads to the wheel. Locke will stop the time flashes, and as he lowers himself, James and the others bid him good-bye. Just then, another flash engulfs the Island, forcing James to try to grasp Locke's hand, but to no avail. Once the flash is passed, the well is not even existent. In a frenzy, James starts digging at the ground, but Juliet tells him Locke is gone.

====1974====

Locke then goes into a cave and turns the crank, which Ben originally turned, and the island stops moving through time. James, Juliet, Miles and Jin head back to Daniel, who informs them Charlotte has died due to violent shifts through time. As they all head back to the beach they hear the sound of gunshots and a woman screaming. Approaching the source of the commotion they see two men holding a woman hostage with a bag over her head after just killing her male companion. James and Juliet aim their guns at the men and tell them to stand down but when one of the men takes a shot at James both he and Juliet kill the men in self-defense. James releases the woman, who introduces herself as Amy. She tells them they need to bury the men they killed and to take her husband's body back to her people in order to keep a truce. As the team and the woman called Amy trudge back, they approach a sonic fence. Amy appears to turn off the machine and walk through it without being harmed. However James, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Jin walk through and are all knocked unconscious. Amy is revealed to be wearing earplugs. 

James later wakes up in a house on a couch.  A man named Horace Goodspeed ([[Doug Hutchison]]) demands to know who he and his friends are. Being a slick con-man, he lies and tells Horace his name is Jim LaFleur and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island. Horace, believing his story, tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that James and his friends must be on it. James asks if he could search for his &quot;other friends,&quot; but his plea is denied. It appears Horace and Amy are part of the DHARMA Initiative.  Later that night, Richard Alpert enters the Barracks, DHARMA's homes, to demand where his two men, the ones James killed, are buried.  James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to Richard alone. He explains to Richard he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with John Locke, who had met Richard a few years prior during an earlier flash. He gives the flustered Richard information able to fully convince the latter. James also tells Richard that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense; Richard however tells him his people are livid and want some justice; Amy agrees to give Richard the body of Paul, her husband, in order to keep the truce. The agreement is made; Richard leaves. It appears the present time is 1974, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative's presence on the Island. Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce, stating they must respect their own privacy on the Island. A relieved and obliged Horace kindly informs James he and his fellow survivors can stay on the Island for two more weeks in order to search for his friends (Locke), before boarding the next submarine off the Island. James and Juliet share a quiet moment at the dock, the latter telling the former her longing to leave the Island is at its peak. She wants to leave on the next submarine, but James reminds her she has nothing to go back to, since they are thirty years back. Juliet consents to staying.

====1977====

Three years pass, and James is still on the Island along with his friends.  They are all working for DHARMA, and for the most part they are contented living at the Barracks, especially James, who shares a home with Juliet.  He is the head of security and an apparently trustworthy figure, using his alias “Jim LaFleur.” One morning, he receives a call from Jin regarding the return of Jack, Kate, and Hurley, having returned to the Island and to the past. Stunned, he goes out to meet them at a grassy field far from the Barracks, and there he tells them of his position within DHARMA and the present time of 1977. Kate's return makes him realize that despite being apart for 3 years and having fallen for Juliet, he is still in love with Kate, and becomes torn between her and Juliet. Likewise, Kate continues to be torn between Jack and Sawyer, and is jealous upon learning of Sawyer's relationship with Juliet. In order to smuggle them into DHARMA, Sawyer instructs the three to dress up in appropriate clothing and pretend to be new recruits for DHARMA so as to avoid awkward questions and the Hostiles, DHARMA’s name of choice for the Others.  Later Sayid, (last seen in [[316 (Lost)|316]]), who also traveled back in time, is caught in the jungle and is mistaken by DHARMA as a Hostile.  James is pressured to execute him for violating the code of truce between DHARMA and the Hostiles, but he has him locked in a cell and quietly contemplates a plan to free him.  

Sayid escapes a few days later with the help of eleven-year-old [[Benjamin Linus|Ben]].  After the former shoots the latter and runs off, Jin carries the boy back to the Barracks, where he is treated with minimal success at the infirmary.  James alerts Jack and pleads him to help, but his request is snubbed.  Eventually, James and Kate take the unconscious boy to the Others, believing they can provide the only cure.  After doing so, with the caveat Ben will never be the same again, James asks Miles through the surveillance camera at the border between DHARMA’s area and the Others’ territory to remove the tape containing footage of Ben being taken away.  The two return to the Barracks afterward.  James is alerted of Roger Linus’s, Ben’s father, suspicions, and begins to worry about what may come next.  Security staff member Phil ([[Patrick Fischler]]) confronts James and shows him the tape mentioned earlier, this proving Miles failed James’ order.  James knocks him out in response and keeps him tied up and gagged in the closet.  The next day, he holds a meeting with only the Oceanic Six survivors and Juliet and reluctantly tells them his comfortable life within DHARMA is ending, thanks to Jack, Kate, and Hurley.  He wants to return the beach and start over.  However, following the events in [[The Variable]], Radzinsky, an antagonistic engineer of DHARMA’s, discovers Phil in the closet and ties up James and Juliet in two chairs, furiously demanding answers. James refuses to comply, forcing Radzinsky to violently beat him, even with Horace pleading him not to.  When Dr. Pierre Chang ([[Francois Chau]]) disrupts the interrogation to order everyone to leave the Island because of impending danger, James requests the women and children get on the submarine and leave.  He also agrees to tell everyone everything on the condition he and Juliet also get spots on the sub.  An agreement is made; they get on board, James hoping never to turn back.  Unfortunately, Kate also gets on, informing him and Juliet of Jack’s intentions to detonate a hydrogen bomb which will decimate the Island and alter the past so Oceanic 815 will never crash twenty-seven years from now.  Very reluctantly, James agrees to help stop Jack, and the three secretly leave the sub and head back to the beach.  After briefly meeting up with [[Rose Henderson|Rose]] and [[Bernard Nadler|Bernard]] (last seen in [[The Lie (Lost)|The Lie]]) and leaving them, they confront Jack, Hurley, Sayid, Jin, and Miles.  James drags Jack to a secluded area and tells him that he, James, could have stopped [[List of Lost characters|Anthony Cooper]] from conning his parents and thus preventing their deaths a year ago, but asserts what is done is done, and Jack should do the same in his case.  When Jack rebuffs, they get into a fistfight which continued until Juliet intervenes.  Much to James’ vexation, Juliet agrees with Jack.  Juliet tells James she will never lose him if she does not know him.  

As Jack prepares to go to the constructing Swan Station to drop the bomb on the electromagnetic source, Phil and his men spot him and try to shoot him down.  James, Juliet, Kate, and Miles come to Jack’s aid, and an intense gunfight ensues.  DHARMA’s men are besieged, and James urges Jack to go ahead and discharge the bomb.  However, the bomb does not go off, and the electromagnetic source is activated, causing pandemonium.  Phil nearly kills James, but is stabbed dead by a [[rebar]] in the process.  Amidst the chaos, James spots Juliet falling in the chasm and in danger of getting sucked in.  He and Kate grasp her hands and he tells her to not to leave him, but the force becomes too strong, causing pain for all of them.  Juliet tells James she loves him and releases her clutch, dropping down to the bottom where she cannot be seen.  James sobs hysterically, not registering himself, even when Kate and Jack drag him back up.

===Season 6 ===

====2007====
In the premiere of season 6, James wakes up in the middle of the jungle and finds out he and the rest of the group traveled back to 2007. They discover the Swan imploded, just like they left it in 2004. James realizes the plan didn't work and Juliet died for no reason, and he beats Jack. They all fall into the hole where the hatch door was supposed to be, and Kate suddenly hears moaning coming from underneath the steel, which leads her to believe Juliet may still be alive. After removing all the pieces of metal, James climbs down and finds a heavily bleeding Juliet. She asks him to kiss her, and after doing so, Juliet dies in his arms. James buries her with Miles' help, but really wants him to implement his [[medium (communication)|medium]] skills to find out what Juliet's dying words were supposed to be. Miles says Juliet told him &quot;it worked,&quot; to which James pouts. Later, he and Miles are captured by the Others, but not before taking down several of them as Miles proclaimed. They are taken to the Temple, the Others' vicinity and only safe location from the Smoke Monster.  In his anger over Juliet's death, he tells the Others to do whatever they want with his friends, whom he proclaims are no longer his friends to this point, and leaves. Kate goes after him, following him back to the Barracks and what used to be his and Juliet's house. When James and Kate sit on the docks, he confesses he planned on asking Juliet to marry him, having a ring and all. He admits to Kate he should have let Juliet leave with the sub when she asked him to, back in 1974, but made her stay because he didn't want to be alone. He also tells Kate he doesn't blame her for Juliet's death. He throws the ring in the ocean and then leaves, telling Kate that he will not help her on her mission to find Claire.

He spends his time playing loud music from his record player and drinking. When the Smoke Monster shows up, in the form of [[John Locke (Lost)|Locke]], James is not entirely surprised about it, but suspects he is not Locke, judging by the way he talks. The Man in Black persuades him to follow him to a part of the Island to answer the most important question of all: &quot;Why is (James) on the Island?&quot; They then head off; James spots a boy in the jungle and the Man in Black is perturbed to know he can see him too.  While the Man in Black runs after the mysterious boy, James meets [[Richard Alpert|Richard]], who frantically asks him to come along to the Temple.  James refuses, and Richard, hearing the Man in Black coming back, runs off. They climb down a cliff to a cave. James sees a scale with a black stone and a white stone, the Man in Black throwing into the sea the latter. The Man in Black then shows James mysterious carvings on the cave ceiling; among them are the surnames of John, Hurley, James (himself), Sayid, Jack, and Sun. [[Mythology of Lost|The Numbers]] 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 correspond to a surname, for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively. James is informed Jacob picked and manipulated those people at various points in their lives to have them show up on the Island. James is a candidate to take up the mantle of leader of the Island; thus, he is given three choices: do nothing, become leader of the Island, or leave the Island with the Man in Black. James firmly chooses the third choice.

He follows the Man in Black to Claire's camp, Claire being a follower of the former. James agrees with Jin he will help look for Sun. The Man in Black then sends him to the other Island, dubbed &quot;Hydra Island&quot; to look for survivors of the Ajira Airways Flight 316. Arriving there, James greets Zoey ([[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]]), who tells him she is the remaining survivor. However, James learns she is lying and demands answers, until a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]), who has returned on a submarine. James makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. He travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating he is loyal to the Man in Black. However, he later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted. 

When the Man in Black leaves to recruit Sun, James tries to stop Jin from leaving camp, until a barrage of tranquilizers bring them down. Jin is taken away by Widmore's team, who has been spying on them, and James tries to remain calm as the situation reaches higher levels of strain. 

In the series finale, James escapes the island on an airplane piloted by [[Frank Lapidus]], along with [[Kate Austen]], [[Claire Littleton]], [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] and [[Miles Straume]].

===Afterlife===
After James' untold death at a later date, he appears in the alternate timeline in 2004. James is on the plane along with the rest of the passengers and has a conversation with Hurley. He somewhat flirts with Kate, a fugitive again, escorted by Edward Mars. Later on, after the plane lands, James and Kate share an elevator at the airport, him noticing the handcuffs around her wrists and realizing her criminal status. When security guards enter the elevator, James helps Kate escape them, knowing she's on the run.

As it turns out, James is actually a policeman from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]].  His partner is [[Miles Straume|Miles]].  However, his back story involving his parents' death at the hands of [[Characters of Lost|Anthony Cooper]] remains unchanged (as shown in his blind date with [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]]), and he is adamant on hunting Cooper down and killing him.  He had traveled to Australia to look for him, under the pretense he went to [[Palm Springs]], as he had told Miles.  However, Miles finds out the truth and threatens to sever their partnership unless James tells him about the trip to Australia.  Later, in his car James tells Miles everything, including his yearn to kill Cooper. Miles objects, but before James can respond, a car crashes into his and its driver runs off. The two cops pursue, and James apprehends the driver, [[Kate Austen|Kate]].

Along with Kate, James and Miles arrest Sayid, their only suspect in the killing of Martin Keamy and his men. [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun]] was shot during the battle and was included in the report. After [[Desmond Hume|Desmond]] runs over [[John Locke|Locke]] with his car and attacks [[Benjamin Linus|Ben]], he turns himself in to James. The three (Sayid, Kate and Desmond) are then told they are being transported to County Prison. Before the concert begins in the final episode, [[The End (Lost)|The End]], Miles sees Sayid in the passenger seat of Hurley's car. He notifies James, who then believes Sayid is after Sun, at the hospital. When James arrives, Sun and Jin are preparing to leave. He notifies them of the possibility of Sun being Sayid's target but they both re-assure him she is safe. Before they leave the hospital room, Jin tells James, &quot;We'll see you there&quot;, which leaves him confused. He leaves the room shortly after and bumps into Jack asking him if he knows where to get some food around here. Jack tells  him the cafeteria is closed but there are vending machines at the end of the corridor to which he responds, &quot;thanks Doc&quot;. A connection was seen between the two but nothing played out. The candy he chooses gets stuck so he tries to reach it using the tray at the bottom. Juliet arrives at the same moment and gives her advice to unplug the machine and the candy will fall. While unplugging the machine, there is a short and the entire room's electricity goes off. Juliet then tells him it worked and while handing him the candy, they both flash. They begin to recall the last few words they said to each other about getting coffee, and they touch again, which allows them to remember what occurred. They embrace, hug, and kiss and are later seen at the church with the other main characters.  James and Juliet move on to the next phase of the afterlife together, as soulmates.

== Personality ==

Sawyer is not initially liked by the other survivors due to his narcissistic personality, rude attitude, and his habit of calling everyone by offensive nicknames. He keeps a stash of such items as [[Whiskey]] and [[pornography]], which he had stolen from the wreckage.  He is manipulative of his fellow survivors. For example, he claimed to be in possession of [[Shannon (Lost)|Shannon's]] asthma medication and promised to hand it over for a kiss from Kate: it is revealed after the kiss that he never had the medication in the first place. It is also hard for him to work with other people, a quality essential for surviving on the island, and is quoted saying &quot;every man for himself&quot; when he is expected to help Jack escape from The Others in [[Lost (season 3)|season three]]. However, he grows more mature and caring in the later seasons, mostly because of his love for Kate, and, later, his own leadership role on the island and his relationship with Juliet. He shows his emotional side occasionally in the earlier seasons, too, especially in the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. He is very often depicted reading books, a habit that contrasts with his &quot;redneck&quot; side.

==Development==
Sawyer was originally a slick conman who wore a Prada suit. Midway through his audition for the role, Josh Holloway forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration. He managed to remember his lines after this and finished reading the monologue. The producers knew he didn’t suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, and kept the same intelligence he originally had. [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]], [[Jorge Garcia]] and [[Dominic Monaghan]] read Sawyer's lines when they came in to audition because there was no existing script for their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;&gt;&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;.  ''[[Lost (season 1)#DVD release|Lost: The Complete First Season]]'', [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].  September 6, 2005.

'''Dr. Adam Forsythe''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]''. He was played by [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]].

==Storylines==
Adam arrived, looking for a quiet life in Emmerdale, following his divorce. His first medical emergency from on his arrival was being alerted by [[Daz Eden]] ([[Luke Tittensor]]) that [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) was in labour while in [[Seth Armstrong]]'s ([[Stan Richards]]) hut.

Adam set up a clinic at the church hall and worked hard to gain the respect and admiration of his new neighbours. Working in the village and living at the B&amp;B, Adam was right at the heart of the community and soon won over pensioners [[Edna Birch]] ([[Shirley Stelfox]]) and [[Betty Eagleton]] ([[Paula Tilbrook]]) with his well-worn [[charm offensive]]. It wasn’t just the pensioners that loved the new [[General practitioner|GP]].

His living circumstances meant Adam started spending a lot of time with B&amp;B manager [[Steph Stokes]] ([[Lorraine Chase]]) – who was finally getting her life back on track after a traumatic year. From the offset there was a flicker of attraction between the pair and as they continued to live under the same roof as their relationship blossomed. But falling in love hadn’t been on Steph’s agenda – especially considering she’d never experienced real devotion before. However, Adam got her to trust him and soon she opened up about her traumatic childhood, confessing to him that her brother [[Terence Turner|Terence]] ([[Nick Brimble]]) had [[Child molestation|sexually abused]] her. Horrified by the revelations, Adam vowed to support Steph and appealed to her to tell her father [[Alan Turner (Emmerdale)|Alan]] ([[Richard Thorp]]) what had happened. However, as Steph and Adam were grappling with the fall out of her confession, Alan had got back in touch with Terence.

Upon arriving in Emmerdale, Terence was quick to deny Steph's claims – leaving only Adam believing her story. Life was hard for the couple as Terence continued to cast a shadow over their lives but a breakthrough came when the violent alcoholic admitted to Alan that he had abused Steph. Adam was delighted to see him driven out of Emmerdale and hoped for a quieter life. The problem was that Terence had no intention of going quietly and started digging around in the doctor’s past to find [[blackmail]] material. He didn’t have to dig too far, soon Terence discovered that Adam was not legally allowed to practice as a doctor after being struck off years before for assaulting a child. Backed into a corner, Adam started to panic and when he came home to find Terence in the B&amp;B cornering Steph, a struggle ensued. The violent altercation ended when Adam struck Terence over the head with a [[Fire extinguisher]] and killed him. He and Steph dragged the body to the woods and buried it.

Terrified she was going to confess all, Adam then whisked Steph away to [[Barbados]] and married her. The newlyweds returned to Emmerdale but it was clear Steph wasn’t coping so Adam felt forced to drug her to try to contain her growing paranoia – provoking suspicion in those close to them. But as hard as Adam tried to keep Steph quiet, he couldn't and when she spectacularly fell apart, he was forced to take drastic measures. Letting her confess to Alan, Adam then accompanied father and daughter to the woods where Steph offered to dig up Terence’s corpse. However, Adam had already moved it and Steph later found out that he moved Terence's body to under the Kings Show Home, (where it was discovered after the House Collapse) and she was left, looking mad. Realising he had double-crossed her, Steph went crazy and was promptly sectioned. Adam has proved that beneath the polished surface beats the heart of a calculating villain willing to go to any measures to stay afloat.

Adam left the village to escape what he thought was the inevitable exposing of his actions. The police discovered Terence's body. It emerged from the police that Adam was able to continue to illegally practice medicine, because his father, who had the same name and was also a doctor, died whilst abroad in Africa. Adam did not inform the authorities  (the [[General Medical Council|GMC]] and coroner's office) in the UK, but merely obtained and started using his dead father's Medical Registration documents. On 7 November, the day of Steph's trial, Adam was led to court in handcuffs to testify against his estranged wife who flew into a rage when she saw him after the court had adjourned for the day. After Steph falsely admitted to murdering Terence along with Adam, Adam committed suicide in prison, by hanging himself, and his body was found on 12 November.

Anne is the mother of [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]) and wife of [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] (Paul Clayton). The character and casting was announced on 4 August 2011. Taylor revealed she had found her first day on set &quot;terrifying&quot;, but she quickly settled in. A reporter for the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' branded Anne a &quot;pompous matriarch&quot;. Taylor said that after being revealed as Frank's killer, she fears that she will be hated in real life. She also admitted that she only knew the identity of Frank's killer when Lancel revealed it to her during filming and added that she loved filming her scenes as Anne. Taylor made her first appearance as Anne on 4 September 2011. She was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 15 years in prison and made her last appearance on 19 March 2012.

==Storylines==
Anne and Sam arrive to celebrate Frank's engagement to [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]). Following a car accident involving Frank and Carla, Anne and Sam go to the hospital to check Frank and Carla are okay.

Anne later returns to tells Carla that she will be taking over Frank's share of the business until Frank is cleared of raping Carla. Anne joins Frank at his new factory and is very pleased to hear that Carla has had a meltdown and fired the workers. [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) hears what Frank has done to Carla and goes to Frank's factory to bring everyone back to work at Underworld, angering Anne. Anne tries to persuade Carla to drop the charges in exchange for Frank's share of Underworld but Carla refuses and throws her out of her home. Anne goes on a cruise with Sam and a couple of days later she phones Frank and tells him his father has died. Anne comes home and initially struggles with her grief, blaming Carla for Sam's death and confronts her at the factory. Anne returns to work with Frank and [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) and they return to Underworld, alongside Carla and Michelle. Anne later learns that Frank is having an affair with [[Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) behind Sally's back and tells her so Frank then fires Anne and tells her to go home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Sally finally sees Frank's true colours|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a366275/sally-finally-sees-franks-true-colours.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne is devastated when Frank is found dead in the factory. She sees Frank's body being removed from Underworld and tells the police that she believes Carla killed Frank. She later notices the contract that gave Frank full ownership of Underworld is missing and accuses Carla of stealing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Peter cannot remember last night|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a367077/peter-cannot-remember-last-night.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally realises Frank's watch is missing and Anne assures her she will tell the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Sally uncovers a new clue|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369101/sally-uncovers-a-new-clue.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne attends Frank's funeral with Sally and apologises to Carla, which Carla finds suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Frank's funeral takes place|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369460/franks-funeral-takes-place.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later goes home alone and Sally visits her. She sees that Anne has Frank's watch and assumes that the police have returned it until Anne admits that she has had it all along. Sally realises that Anne killed Frank and tries to leave but trips and hits her head. Anne, however, calmly continues packing her bags until Carla arrives, wanting to know why Anne apologised earlier. Carla finds Sally and goes to call an ambulance, but Anne threatens her with a knife. Anne explains that she blamed Frank for Sam's death after overhearing Frank goading Carla about the rape. She went to the factory to get his watch back, but she struggles with Frank for it. When he pushed her away, she picked up a whiskey bottle and hit him. Carla then talks Anne into dropping the knife and she is later arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Frank's killer tries to flee|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369462/franks-killer-tries-to-flee.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and casting==
Anne made her first on screen appearance on 4 September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/meetfranksparents/|title=Meet Frank's Parents|date=4 August 2011|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character and casting was announced on 4 August 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt; Taylor revealed she had found her first day on set &quot;terrifying&quot;, but she quickly settled in.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a344110/coronation-street-frank-will-be-protected-by-anne-says-gwen-taylor.html|title='Coronation Street' Frank will be protected by Anne, says Gwen Taylor|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 October 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was married to [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] (Paul Clayton) and is the mother of [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt; Of Anne and Sam, a show spokesperson said &quot;Sam and Anne are pretty full -on characters, like Frank. No sooner have they arrived than they're talking grandchildren which instantly freaks Carla out and tensions soon rise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt;

Taylor admitted in March 2012 that adjusting to the tight soap schedule was a challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' Gwen Taylor: 'I upped my game for Anne role'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a372831/coronation-street-gwen-taylor-i-upped-my-game-for-anne-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor said she was impressed with the acting skills of the regular cast, especially the one with children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot; /&gt; She commented: &quot;I'm going to remember the commitment that everyone had for the work. A lot of the women there had babies and young children, but everyone turned up on time and knew their lines - and I was so impressed by that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot; /&gt; When signing to play Anne, Taylor had no idea that she would be playing a killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Corrie's Gwen Taylor: 'Andrew Lancel told me I was the killer'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a372131/corries-gwen-taylor-andrew-lancel-told-me-i-was-the-killer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=22 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress departed from ''Coronation Street'' in March 2012, after the conclusion to Frank's murder storyline.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt;

==Development==
After Frank's fiancé, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), accuses him of raping her and calls off the wedding, Anne supports her son.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt; She installs herself at Underworld to protect Frank's half of the business and makes Carla's life a misery.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt; Of Anne's support for Frank, Taylor said &quot;In Anne's eyes, Frank can do no wrong. She'll do whatever it takes to protect him. If he tells her he didn't do it, then he didn't do it. There are plenty of mums out there like that. When the recent riots happened, some women refused point blank to believe their children had been involved. So mums can be a pretty loyal bunch, for good or ill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt;

In January 2012, it was announced that Frank would be killed in an upcoming &quot;whodunnit&quot; storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' confirms Frank Foster death plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a363873/coronation-street-confirms-frank-foster-death-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=22 March 2012|date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/891632-five-coronation-street-favourites-suspected-of-frank-fosters-murder|title=Five Coronation Street favourites suspected of Frank Foster's murder|date=28 February 2012|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank was found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; The ''Metro'' reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; Carla, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]), also fell under suspicion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; Anne was not listed among the characters, but Sarah Ellis of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' included Anne as an additional suspect during a feature on Frank's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|title=The prime suspects!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=3–9 March 2012|issue=9|pages=6–7|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis stated that Anne develops a motive for killing Frank after she discovers his true colours, despite believing he could do no wrong. Anne was devastated as she realised that she had got her son so wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Ellis pointed out that Anne played every inch the grieving mother and by blaming other people for her son's death, she could have been covering her own tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Ellis added that it must have been painful for Anne to realise that she had raised a monster, so maybe she decided to get rid of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Taylor said that after being revealed as Frank's killer, she feared that she would be hated in real life.&lt;ref name=Hated&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Jen|title=Corrie Anne: I'm most hated in Britain|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4205783/Corrie-Anne-Im-most-hated-in-Britain.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=News Group Newspapers|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to a reporter for ''TV Biz'' Taylor said that Anne had been the nastiest character she ever played.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; Taylor quipped that Anne had been very unkind and cruel towards Sally after she is revealed as killed Frank's killer.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; She added &quot;I hoped I'd get to play a character this evil one day. They are always more interesting and I'd like to do it again. It's nice to play someone with no redeeming features.

Taylor also revealed people had also confronted her in public, having recognised her from the soap.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; Taylor admitted that she only knew the identity of Frank's killer when Lancel revealed it to her during filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; She explained &quot;It was strange, because I didn't know when I signed on that it was going to develop so brilliantly. But a little while after, Andrew was telling me that he was leaving at a certain point.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; Taylor also said she loved filming her &quot;showdown&quot; with Carla when she tries to call emergency services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; Speaking of Anne's situation, Taylor said &quot;A lot has happened to the poor woman, she's lost her husband then her son and stuck to her guns about his innocence. Then she begins to realise something is very wrong. The humiliation of that, and the fact she has been so horrible to people, is too much for her to live with.

'''Tory Foster''' is a [[fictional character]] from the 2004 TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', portrayed by [[Rekha Sharma]].

==Character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
Tory, like the other members of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The Final Five (Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh)|Final Five]], was originally from a planet called [[Earth_in_science_fiction#Battlestar_Galactica|Earth]]. This Earth had been colonized by the 13th Tribe (composed of [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] from the planet [[Kobol]]) roughly 4,000 years before the events of the series (c.152,000 BC as revealed by the final episode). Tory and [[Galen Tyrol]] were in a relationship in their past lives - they lived together and planned to get married. Tory and the other members of the group that would later be known as the Final Five were working to recreate the resurrection process their Cylon ancestors used to employ on Kobol, a process that had fallen out of favor on Earth due to procreation. They had some advance knowledge of the impending destruction due to warnings from people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Tory looked like a man. When Earth was destroyed roughly 2,000 years ago the Final Five arranged to have themselves resurrected aboard a sub-light ship orbiting earth. They then left to find the Twelve Colonies and warn them about treating their artificial life with respect or face the same doom that befell Earth. By the time the Final Five completed their sublight journey thousands of years had passed, and they arrived near the end of the first Cylon/human war. Meeting the Cylon centurions, the Five offered to show them how to create humanoid cylon models in exchange for the centurions ending the war. The Final Five created eight models. However, the first model ([[John Cavil]]) destroyed the seventh model ([[Number Seven (Battlestar Galactica)|Daniel]]) out of fraternal envy. Cavil then killed the Final Five and boxed their minds for years, later resurrecting them in new bodies and reprogramming them to think they were humans from the Twelve Colonies. Presumably, he also reprogrammed the other Cylon models to not think about the Final Five or investigate their identities, and that to do so would constitute heresy.

In her new life, before [[the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies]], Tory was a precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi on Caprica for five years. In this capacity, she became an expert on [[opinion poll|polling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the nuclear attack on the Colonies she was driving down a road on Caprica and got hit by the force of a nuclear shockwave.  Her car was destroyed and she was injured, but she managed to survive the shockwave and was presumably picked up by a Raptor that landed nearby looking for survivors.

Following the death of [[Billy Keikeya]], Tory Foster becomes one of [[President]] [[Laura Roslin]]'s chief aides and advisors. She takes a particular responsibility for managing Roslin's election campaign. One of her first moves is to take an opinion poll, the results of which clearly show Roslin leading her presumptive opponent, [[Tom Zarek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt; She plays a part in finding a human foster mother for the half-Cylon child [[Hera Agathon]] and is one of the few people who know the child is alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downloaded&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Downloaded| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counsels Roslin during the Rya Kibby case, as she weighs up the consequences of appeasing the [[pro-life]] beliefs of the Gemenese and the need to repopulate the human race versus the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under Colonial law before the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt;

After Roslin's executive order criminalizes abortion throughout the fleet, [[Vice-President]] [[Gaius Baltar]] announces his candidacy in the forthcoming election, and garners Zarek's support as campaign manager (and eventual Vice-President&lt;ref name=&quot;Precipice&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Precipice (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Precipice| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The discovery of [[New Caprica]] and the Baltar-Zarek campaign's pro-settlement position swings much popular support away from Roslin. With Roslin's at first tacit, and later explicit, approval, Foster conspires with [[Colonel]] [[Saul Tigh]] and others to rig the election in Roslin's favour. The deception is discovered by [[Lieutenant]] [[Felix Gaeta]] on account of a typographical mistake on one set of ballot papers, and Baltar is sworn in as Roslin's successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation of New Caprica by the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], Foster joins the human resistance movement, again serving as Laura Roslin's aide. She works to compile a list of known Cylon collaborators among the human population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Precipice&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupation&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Occupation| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helps to organize the swift and orderly evacuation of the civilian population to their assigned vessels, and is one of the last people to see [[Maya (Battlestar Galactica)|Maya]] and her adopted daughter [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera/Isis]] as the evacuation takes place. Despite having two bodyguards, Maya does not make it off New Caprica, Hera is captured by [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]], and Foster personally apologizes to Roslin for what she sees as her failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exodus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roslin's second [[inauguration]] as President of the Twelve Colonies, Foster resumes her former duties as a presidential aide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collaborators&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Collaborators| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few episodes of season 3, her mental condition starts deteriorating, and she starts hearing music. In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, &quot;[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]&quot;, she, along with [[Samuel Anders]], [[Saul Tigh]], and [[Galen Tyrol]] become aware of the fact they are Cylons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07085/770732-352.stm Ronald Moore confirms they are Cylons in this interview]&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[music]] (which turns out to be &quot;[[All Along The Watchtower]],&quot; as performed by [[Bear McCreary|Bear McCreary's]] brother &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearmccreary.com/html/blog/blogmain.htm|title=Bear's Battlestar Galactica Blog|accessdate=2007-12-11|author=Bear McCreary|work=|date=2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) only they can hear, and a &quot;switch&quot; that goes off within them (as Chief Tyrol mentions). Foster and Anders have experienced at least the beginnings of a physical relationship. As the Cylon fleet attacked, Tigh defiantly declared &quot;Whatever else I am, I'm an officer in the Colonial Fleet and if I die today, that's the man I'll be.&quot; Following this speech, Foster reported to the CIC to aid President Roslin.

Season 4 opens with Tory Foster continuing her participation in clandestine final-four Cylon meetings (Anders, Foster, Tigh, Tyrol). Tigh suggests Gaius Baltar as a potential source of information, citing Baltar's previous time spent among the Cylons;  Foster attempts to gain Gaius' confidence via professed admiration and seduction. Despite her initial objection to actual sexual relations, she has sex with Baltar during which she weeps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Six of One&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)| title= Six of One | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baltar asks why she is crying, she says it's just something she does, and things could be worse: she could be a Cylon. Baltar tells her he believes Cylons can feel, and, touched, she stops crying and kisses him in earnest. Subsequently, she seems to be spending more and more time with Baltar, not necessarily just to gain information. In &quot;[[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]],&quot; she attends one of Baltar's monotheism rallies, and appears to be approving.

When she discovers [[Cally Tyrol]] has overheard one of the clandestine meetings, she follows her to a [[Colonial Viper|Viper]] launch tube, dissuades Cally from killing herself and her son, and secures the infant, but Foster then ejects the mother out the tube herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)| title= The Ties That Bind | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster shows no guilt. She appears to have embraced both being a Cylon and her own version of Baltar's teachings, allowing her to by-pass such feelings and adopt an almost hedonistic approach to life. She declares herself to be &quot;perfect&quot;, something that disturbs fellow Cylons Tigh and Tyrol, and is in marked contrast to Tigh's and Caprica Six's guilty consciences ([[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]).

Later, Foster meets with President Roslin, who first pleasantly comments about Foster's positive change in mood any time she is aboard Galactica. Roslin asks Foster to find out who was sharing the rumors of the president's shared visions to Baltar, then sticks the dagger in, telling Foster she is very aware that she is sleeping with Gaius Baltar. Before Foster can say a word, Roslin tells her there are enough reports of her visitations to &quot;make her a charter member of his nymph squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt;&quot; Foster confesses to believing in Baltar's spiritual message, but Roslin is feeling quite betrayed and turns her back on her to do other work, ordering her away ([[Guess What's Coming to Dinner?]]).

Out of the known members of the Final Five, Tory seems to be embracing her Cylon-self more than the others. The other three are attempting to maintain their human selves (the same way that [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Boomer]] did). This results in a change to her personality.

After Downloaded Three is unboxed, now knowing the identities of the Final Five, and brought to Galactica, Foster stays true her earlier affinity for her Cylon side. Under the pretence of bringing Laura Roslin her medication, she flies to the Cylon basestar, where she is introduced to her fellow Cylons and tells Roslin and Baltar about her true nature. During the ensuing stand off between Three and Galactica over the remaining three Cylons, she helps Three's cause by informing her of Lee Adama's perceived weaknesses (Revelations).

When the fleet arrives at Earth and discovers it is a barren world destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe and once populated by Cylons, Foster and her fellow Final Five Cylons begin remembering details about their past lives on the planet. One detail she clearly remembers is how Anders used to be a musician and used to play a song he wrote for her and their friends, Galen Tyrol and Saul and Ellen Tigh. She and Tyrol were also lovers at the time ([[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]).

Since being publicly identified as a member of the Final Five Cylons, Foster has taken up full-time residence on board the rebel basestar, living with the Twos, Sixes (less Caprica-Six), and Eights (less Sharon Agathon &amp; Sharon Valerii). Her fellow Cylons appear to have also given her equal status in their command hierarchy, as evident by her behaviour during Gaeta's Mutiny. When Laura Roslin is smuggled aboard the basestar, Foster is content to abandon the fleet to its own turmoil and simply jump away to safety, a notion her fellow Cylons support. Though she repeatedly argues against involving the basestar in the counter-coup efforts, she ultimately concedes to Roslin's plan ([[Blood on the Scales]]).

During Gaeta's mutiny Sam Anders is shot in the back of the skull. When he regains consciousness he remembers his and the others former life on Earth and after. He recites the history as fast as he could to the other Final Five, including Tory Foster. Like the other Fives, she was a scientist attempting to reinvent resurrection technology. To her and Galen Tyrol's mutual shock she learned they were once lived together as lovers and were engaged to be married. (No Exit)

After Anders's apparently unsuccessful (in that he never regained consciousness) surgery and his comatose state, Foster urges the other Finals and Caprica Six to leave for the Baseship and abandon the fleet in order to strike out on their own without humanity. Then Ellen Tigh, the Fifth Final, arrives after apparently being rescued from Cavil by Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii. The Final Five debate the merits of staying with the fleet versus leaving. When the matter is put to a vote, Tyrol and Foster vote to leave and Tigh votes to stay. Though Anders is in a coma during this debate, Tyrol reminds the others Anders had previously pleaded with Colonel Tigh to stay with the fleet, and they agree to count Anders's vote thusly. This means the vote is a 2-2 deadlock with Ellen Tigh holding the deciding vote. Ellen is conflicted and postpones her decision, as she is upset by her discovery of the relationship between Saul Tigh and Caprica Six. Later, driven by jealousy, resentment and anger over Saul Tigh conceiving a child with Caprica Six and the implication he loved Caprica Six more than he ever did Ellen, Ellen makes her decision and votes with Foster and Tyrol to leave humanity. However Caprica Six's miscarriage, possibly brought on by stress caused by an attack in Dogsville and personal confrontations with Ellen Tigh over the true love of Saul Tigh, changes the situation. Foster and the others reluctantly decide to stay, since the loss of Caprica Six's pregnancy means Hera Agathon has become the only remaining hope of Cylon continuity ([[Deadlock]]).

As the Five recover from the tragedy of the miscarriage, Tory commiserates with the others, including a Tyrol desperate to save the life of Boomer, who was about to be transported for trial on the Baseship. She agrees with Ellen Tigh they cannot interfere with Cylon due process other than being witnesses. At Joe's Bar, Tory hears Kara Thrace playing the piano and recognizes the tune as the song switching on the Final Four in the nebula. She confronts Thrace to find out where she learned that song. Thrace informs her it was a song her father played for her as a child. Later off-screen she told them she was playing the music notes written as a drawing by Hera Agathon. By this time, Sharon Valerii had already abducted Hera and escaped back to Cavil's Baseship ([[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]).

Tory continues to congregate with the Final Five, who are by now a close-knit group watching over their comatose member (Anders). However, the group temporarily loses Tyrol as he is imprisoned for his role in unwittingly allowing Valerii to kidnap Hera and escape. Ellen Tigh urges the Adamas to search for Hera on the Cylon Homeworld, and is emphatically supported by Anders's wife [[Kara Thrace]]. Tory abstains from voicing her own opinion on the matter, but she agrees with Ellen's recommendation and helps arrange the Heavy Raider reconnaissance mission after Adama gives his permission ([[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]).

Tory reluctantly volunteers for the mission to rescue Hera, partially due to the insistence of [[Galen Tyrol]]. She assists Ellen in maintaining the link between Anders and ''Galactica'' during the battle. After agreeing to share resurrection technology with the Cylons in exchange for a truce, Tory becomes nervous the sharing process will involve a pooling of her memories with the rest of the Five, which will reveal the truth about the murder of Cally. Tory therefore asks the others to pledge that no matter what they find out about each other, they will forgive each other for it. Tigh agrees and the Five start the process, but when Tyrol sees her memory of murdering Cally he flies into a rage, breaks the download to strangle Tory, and ultimately snaps her neck in retribution.

'''Warren Fox''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Jamie Lomas]]. The character made his first appearance on 26 June 2006. The character and casting was announced on 12 May 2006. Warren was introduced as an old acquaintance of [[Sean Kennedy (Hollyoaks)|Sean Kennedy]] ([[Matthew Jay Lewis]]). The character is decipted as selfish, arrogant and devious who would do anything to get what he wants. Lomas chose to leave the series in 2009 and his departure coincided with the return of [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]). Warren's reintroduction was announced on 17 October 2010 and he returned on 29 October 2010. The character made his second departure from the series in December 2011 and was reintroduced for a second time in May 2016.

His main storylines have revolved around his villainy, and thuggish lifestyle. His first stint on the show saw the character involved in drug dealing, infidelity and a feud with Clare. The character's villainous attitudes have led him to murder two other characters, [[Sean Kennedy]] and Warren's fiancée [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). A show stunt, which saw The Loft set ablaze, apparently killed Warren. The character's 2010 return saw him revealed to have survived the fire and absconded witch saw Warren kill [[Dale Greer]]. Writers plotted a partnership and feud with [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]), which proved popular with viewers. Other storylines involved Warren murdering [[Kyle Ryder]] (Neil Toon) and close relationships with [[Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]). Warren's long-lost son [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still; Rory Douglas-Speed) was introduced in November 2011. Warren was arrested for his crimes in December 2011, serving as his departure. The character was released from prison to aid his 2016 reintroduction. He avenged his imprisonment by targeting Mitzeee's sister [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) and beginning a fake relationship with her under an alias. Maxine became pregnant, but miscarried their child. He also entered a relationship with [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) who targeted Warren and Joel individually after believing Warren caused her daughter's death and also killing [[Bart McQueen]] who Warren thought was responsible for his sister Katy's death back in 2014.

==Storylines==
Warren arrives in Hollyoaks in April 2006 to find Sean. Warren demands money from Sean as compensation for having him jailed, but is willing to write off Sean's debts he owes him in exchange for a night with his wife, [[Louise Summers|Louise Kennedy]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). Louise refuses to sleep with him, and tells Sean that the only way to settle the debt would be to give Warren ownership of Evissa. Sean agrees. Warren embarks on an affair with [[Clare Devine|Clare Cunningham]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), whilst she is still married to [[Max Cunningham]] ([[Matt Littler]]). A passionate rendezvous between them is taped by [[Mel Burton]] ([[Cassie Powney]]), which she shows to [[Sam &quot;OB&quot; O'Brien]] ([[Darren Jeffries]]) and [[Sophie Burton]] ([[Connie Powney]]). Mel and Sophie are killed afterwards, and OB is severely injured, in the explosion at [[The Dog in the Pond]]. OB tells Max about the affair and Max fires Warren from The Loft. Warren hires thugs to trash The Loft. Max reluctantly signs his half of The Loft over to Warren. When Clare returns, she and Warren are partners in owning The Loft. However, Warren and Clare dispute. Warren and [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]) begin to have a rivalry for Louise's affections.

[[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) sleeps with Warren after being accused of infidelity by her boyfriend, [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]). When Warren uncovers Sean's return, demanding £10,000 from Louise, he agrees to help Louise gain the money. However, Warren later kidnaps Sean and kills him. Louise and Calvin end their relationship, and Warren supports her. After sleeping together, Louise guiltily reunites with Calvin. [[Justin Burton]] ([[Chris Fountain]]) later resides with Warren. Warren is arrested for Sean's murder after Clare alerts the police. He is however released after a failure to find Sean's body. Shortly after, Clare is pushed over the balcony of The Loft in an attempt on her life. Justin witness Warren and Mercedes in bed as he plans to leave with [[Katy Fox|Katy]] ([[Hannah Tointon]]). Justin heads to the train station and is run over by a van. Warren is arrested for the attempt on Clare's life, but is innocent. During his court appearance, Warren is found innocent as Mercedes admits she was with him. Warren visited a hospitalised Justin, revealing he was the assailant who almost killed him and later, Katy is disgusted to learn that Warren killed Sean.

Warren grows fonder of Justin, who begins working for Warren, as Louise and Warren's relationship becomes more serious. Clare continues attempts to drive Louise and Warren apart. However, Warren threatens to push her from the balcony if she does not sign over The Loft to him and leave Hollyoaks, to which she agrees. Days later, Warren returns home to his flat to find it trashed and no sign of Katy. Warren, Justin and Max begin looking for her, and are later called by Clare, who tells them she has Katy. Clare tells Warren that she wants revenge on Justin for pushing her over the balcony. Warren pretends to kill Justin. However, Clare is not fooled, so drives off with Katy tied up in the car.

On the wedding day, Warren's foster brother [[Spencer Gray]] ([[Darren John Langford]]) turns up, stating his mother has died. Warren asks him to be his best man. Warren, Ravi and Spencer arrive at the hotel where the wedding is being held. Warren goes up to Louise's room where he hides a necklace for her, however, he finds the gun which she plans to use to kill him. Warren takes the gun and removes the bullets as Louise returns to the room. He gives her the necklace and asks if the gun was his present. Louise reveals she hates Warren because he had ruined her life, killed her husband and cheated on her.

In an attempt to leave the village with some money, Warren makes a deal with Justin to burn down The Loft for £5,000 so that he can claim the insurance money and Justin can get money to start a new life with [[Hannah Ashworth]] ([[Emma Rigby]]). Justin agrees and goes to meet Warren at The Loft, but is stopped by Calvin who tells him not to get involved with another of Warren's schemes. Changing his mind Justin leaves only to be seen by Sasha. While waiting for Justin in the club, Warren is knocked out by Clare using a baseball bat. When Warren awakens, he finds himself tied to a chair and is shocked to see that Clare is alive. She tells him that both he and Justin have ruined her life and makes Warren call Justin to meet at The Loft. Calvin then arrives to speak to Warren and finds Warren tied up, Clare with a match and The Loft covered in petrol. He initially proceeds to do the right thing by calling the police, but after Warren taunts Clare by saying that he always wins, Calvin backs off and leaves his fate in Clare's hands. Hannah arrives at The Loft to find Justin, and Clare accidentally knocks her out. She wakes up and attacks Clare, who drops a match onto the bar, the pair fall through the banister to the floor below unconscious.

Justin starts to untie him but he hears Hannah's calls for help and realises that Warren lied. He leaves him in the fire and escapes with Hannah. Clare is nowhere to be seen and has escaped. Warren unties himself and realises he cannot get out of the balcony door so jumps down the cellar door, he lands on his ankle on the stairs and breaks it. Warren looks up at the ceiling mirror and notices the support chains are on fire. They break and the mirror collapses onto Warren, apparently killing him instantly.

Over a year after his supposed death, Warren returns to Hollyoaks in October 2010, revealing he is alive.

The next day, Warren follows Mandy in the village and is seen by [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]), who claims to have seen Warren's ghost. Warren is later seen by Tony walking past the village walls. Mandy and Warren meet, revealing they are in a relationship and have had contact since their last encounter.

On the same night, a fire is started in Il Gnosh by an unseen character and [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]) and [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) are killed.

The following day, Warren and Mandy argue and she threatens him. Later, Warren enters the McQueens' home where he asks [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) who she has told and mentions that someone else knows, but does not reveal what he is referring to. It is later revealed that Theresa witnessed Warren escaping The Loft and since then, he has been blackmailed. On another occasion, Warren threatens to push Theresa from a roof in the village if she does not tell him who has been blackmailing him. He also reveals how he escaped the fire. In flashback scenes, days before the fire Warren meets a suicidal man named [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2010)#Other characters|Dale Greer]] ([[Chris Geere]]). Dale and Warren bond and he begins working for him. When Clare starts the fire and Warren is apparently killed by the mirror, the floors collapsed and Warren is found by Dale in the cellar. After being rescued by Dale, Warren realises everyone believes he is still in the club. Warren kills Dale before putting his body in the cellar. Warren then threatens to kill Theresa, who witnesses him escaping, if she tells anyone. Warren then leaves the village. With Warren still threatening to push her from the walls, Theresa admits she killed Calvin and this forms the beginning of their relationship, as friends, in which they both help protect the other's secret.

Warren breaks into Chez Chez and tries to break the floor with a sledgehammer, however is interrupted by [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Brendan asks who Warren is. Warren lies that he is Cheryl's boyfriend before phoning Mandy for information about him. Warren enters The Dog to the surprise of local residents. Claiming to have suffered from amnesia, Warren pretends to regain some of his memory of several people. Warren later confronts Tony and the pair have a stand off with Tony threatening to attack Warren for telling Dom to burn down his restaurant which resulted in the death of Steph and Malachy. Warren then leaves and Brendan Brady tells Tony to call the police and inform them that Warren is still alive. Warren is later arrested and taken into custody where he is interviewed by [[DC Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]). Warren tells Ethan to speak to his commanding officers and later Warren is released. After returning to the village Warren meets with Cheryl in time for Christmas and she believes he truly has feelings for her. A few days later Warren returns to the club where he starts to dig up the floor. Danny Houston watches Warren doing so on the club's CCTV and calls Brendan. Danny tells Brendan to find out what Warren is up to, believing him to be in league with the police. Brendan then locks Warren in the cellar and asks him to tell him everything but Warren doesn't. Brendan then leaves Warren locked in the cellar until he admits to what he is up to.Warren and Brendan plan to get Danny's half of the club from him however things don't go to plan and Brendan kills Danny.

Warren finds out that Mandy had been sending him the texts in order for him to come back to Hollyoaks with her. Warren frightens her out the village. When [[Kyle Ryder]] (Neil Toon) is due in court Theresa faces prison. In order to stop her being sent down Warren arranges for Kyle to be beaten up meaning the court case has to be postponed. Brendan helps Warren by getting Kyle to escape from hospital leaving him to go on the run. Brendan jumps to the wrong conclusions believing that Warren really killed Calvin and that Theresa is taking the blame for him. Brendan pretends to be Warren and encourages Kyle to seek revenge on Theresa, hoping that the truth will come out.

Although Warren is supposed to be with Cheryl, he soon returns his cheating ways when [[Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) grabs his attention. Warren doesn't understand why she is interested in Brendan, unknowing their relationship is fake. Warren and Mitzeee almost sleep together but are stopped before they have chance when Cheryl walks in. Cheryl is none the wiser but Brendan cottons on and warns Mitzeee not to make a fool of him.

Warren reassures Theresa when she hears that Kyle is still about, thinking that Brendan has ensured that Kyle has taken the money and run. Warren becomes suspicious when Kyle comes to Chez Chez asking for Warren and Warren later sees him talking to Brendan. Warren does everything he can to persuade Theresa not to leave with her baby in fear of Kyle but she leaves anyway. When Warren phones Theresa and Kyle answers telling him that he is doing what they had arranged Warren realises that Brendan has been pretending to be him. At first Brendan refuses to tell Warren where Kyle has taken Theresa but when he realises that Theresa and her baby Kathleen-Angel might die he tells him. Warren turns up and Kyle knocks him out. Later, Warren has regained consciousness and shoots Kyle in the back not knowing that he is holding Kathleen-Angel, and Kyle falls down the lift shaft with the baby. Theresa is horrified and believes that Warren had been plotting with Kyle all along after what Kyle had said on the phone. Ethan, who had been pushed down the lift shaft by Kyle previously, helps Warren to get Kathleen-Angel out but cannot get out himself. Warren urges Theresa to leave with Carmel and the baby but she doesn't listen and goes back to save Ethan. She falls into the lift shaft while trying and then forces Warren to save Ethan before she lets him save herself. He saves Ethan and then suddenly the lift plummets with Kyle's dead body and Theresa still on top of it.

In hospital as Theresa fights for her life, Carmel accuses Warren of being in love with Theresa and his face leads the audience to think this is true. Warren then makes sure Ethan stays quiet and Theresa says thanks for his help. He then sleeps with Mitzeee and Warren and Brendan have a huge fight. They eventually call a truce until Ste attacks Brendan with a baseball bat, which hospitalises him. Warren then stole drugs from Brendan later in the month and begin a relationship with Mitzeee. When Mitzeee's mum, [[Trish Minniver|Trish]] (Paula Wolfenden), is imprisoned, Ethan agrees to let her go if she gets a confession from Warren admitting to the murder of Louise.

The next day, he burys it under the ground. He then steals a gun and burns the rival stag clothes. Warren then reveals to Mitzeee that he tricked Seth into believing he had killed Honey. Seth's older brother, [[Riley Costello|Riley]] (Rob Norbury), then finds out about this and locks Warren down a mine and Warren then gets animal beaten and gets out of the mine. He then almost kills Riley by flooding the stags and his girlfriend Mitzeee.

When he returns, he visits Brendan in prison and tells him to get used to it.

One night, Mitzeee spends the night at Riley's. Nothing happens but Riley's brother [[Jason Costello]] ([[Victoria Atkin]]) takes a picture of them together and sends it to Warren. After a fight with Riley, Warren is fuming. Carl and Mitzeee stop him from beating Riley to a pulp, however the Costellos then push Mitzeee too far so she and Warren agree to destroy the Costellos on the day of the wedding. Warren gets Mitzeee an invite to the wedding and makes plans to reveal all at the wedding. He fires Gilly and rehires Rhys within a day. Warren warns Doug that if Doug reveals the truth, Warren will break his legs, and demands £50,000 from Mercedes and Carl within 24 hours, or he will reveal the truth. Carl gives him 25,000 of it with the other half on condition of the truth not coming out at the wedding. Doug tells Warren he's going to tell the truth but in retaliation Warren throws Doug to the ground and forces him to put copies of Mitzee's book underneath each chair. Warren sees Doug telling Seth to tell the truth and so Warren attacks Doug and threatens that he will kill him if he reveals the truth. In the end Mercedes tells Riley about the affair at the wedding. After the wedding Warren attacks Doug. Warren visits Brendan in prison to get his share of Chez Chez but Brendan refuses to give it to him so Warren gets him beaten up. When Ethan accidentally runs [[Rob Edwards (Hollyoaks)|Rob Edwards]] (David Atkins) over, Warren helps Ethan repair his vehicle and uses the situation to his advantage for Ethan's help in his dirty games.

Warren gets angry, and chucks Mitzeee's clothes into the river then threatens both Ste and Cheryl but when he threatens new DJ, [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still). Joel claims Warren is his father. Warren goes into denial, believing the claim to be either one of Brendan's games or a lie told to Joel by his mother, however Theresa convinces Warren to have a DNA test which shows he is indeed Joel's father. After this happens Brendan returns and he and Warren declare a truce but Warren tells Ethan he is going to kill Brendan and he wants an alibi from him.

Mitzeee and Brendan hatch a plan to get Warren out of the way by uncovering Louise's murder and getting him sent down.

==Creation and development==
In May 2006, it was announced former ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'' actor [[Jamie Lomas]] would arrive in Hollyoaks as &quot;bad boy&quot; Warren Fox.&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a32863/two-dream-team-actors-transfer-to-hollyoaks.html|title=Two Dream Team actors transfer to Hollyoaks|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=12 May 2006|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his casting, it was announced his former ''Dream Team'' co-star [[Ricky Whittle]] would take on the part of &quot;mysterious&quot; [[Calvin Valentine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;/&gt; Speaking of Lomas and Whittle's casting, a ''Hollyoaks'' spokesperson stated: &quot;We're delighted to welcome Ricky and Jamie to the ''Hollyoaks'' cast. Their characters are set to bring lots of drama to the show!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;/&gt;

Warren immediately showed a confrontational personality from his original appearance on ''Hollyoaks''. He always put himself first, and would do anything to get what he wants involving money, women and business opportunities. Warren is selfish, arrogant and devious.

Following the announcement of Warren's return in October 2010, Jamie Lomas was asked whether he thought the character would have changed since his last appearance. He replied, &quot;I don't think you can really change a character like Warren. I think it would be a little boring if he came back as some sort of softie but, like I say, there are new people around now for him to bounce off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/5ahex5nadibbmj25dc4ub/view.e4 |title=Jamie Lomas (Warren) talks Hollyoaks |author=Abi B |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]] |publisher=([[Channel 4]]) |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Warren spits in Bert Brady's face as he is led away by cops.

In 2009, Jamie Lomas decided to quit the soap after three years. Speaking of his decision, Lomas stated: &quot;I've had a fantastic three years at ''Hollyoaks'' but having fully explored the character, I felt the time was right for me to move on. I'm delighted to be going out as part of such a dramatic storyline and my final scenes are some of the most dramatic I've ever filmed. I'm sure viewers will be hooked!&quot; He continued to say: &quot;I've had a great time playing Warren and have thoroughly enjoyed being part of the ''Hollyoaks'' cast where I've made some brilliant friends and worked with some great people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a149177/two-hollyoaks-stars-to-leave.html|title=Two Hollyoaks stars to leave|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Lomas admitted he initially wanted to stay on the show for only two years: &quot;Well I wanted to go after two years. I sat down with Bryan Kirkwood who told me what he had in store and it was too good to refuse! The storyline was so fantastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a157274/jamie-lomass-final-hollyoaks-interview.html |title=Jamie Lomas's Final Hollyoaks Interview |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed how he felt about his final appearance, admitting: &quot;To be honest with you, when I knew I was filming my final scene — obviously I've spent three years of my life there and I've got lots of good friends there - I got really emotional. I had to take myself off and have a word with myself and say 'Come on — you need to pull it together!' It was great because all the producers came down and clapped me and bought me a bottle of champagne.

Lomas's final appearance as Warren also saw the return of [[Gemma Bissix]]'s character, and Warren's enemy, [[Clare Devine]], and featured a fire in The Loft, which caused Warren's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a150705/gemma-bissix-returns-to-hollyoaks.html |title=Gemma Bissix returns to Hollyoaks |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, it was announced Lomas would be reintroduced to ''Hollyoaks'' in late 2010, when it is revealed that he in fact survived the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;shockreturn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a282528/shock-comeback-for-hollyoaks-character.html|title=Shock comeback for Hollyoaks character|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=17 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series producer [[Paul Marquess]] commented on Warren's return, saying: &quot;We were hopeful that Jamie's return would be the best-kept secret in soap history, but when Jamie arrived on set it proved impossible. When Warren Fox died in the Loft fire, we all thought that was the end of the dangerous gangster that terrorised the residents of Hollyoaks village. But when our writers made the shocking suggestion to bring back Warren in a juicy plot, it was just too irresistible to ignore as they not only made it feasible that Warren could have escaped the fire and fled the village, they created an explosive and very clever plot with lots of twists and turns that is guaranteed to have the audience hooked. When the idea was pitched to Jamie, he knew it was too good an opportunity to miss. Warren Fox was one of the soap's most memorable villains and we're very excited about his return.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shockreturn&quot;/&gt; He returned on 29 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/cghinnrbef4eopboipwa4g/view.e4 |title=Warren Fox to return to Hollyoaks! |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]] |publisher=([[Channel 4]]) |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomas later expressed his feelings about returning, saying: &quot;I'm really excited. I got the call and I got told about the storyline and it was great — full of twists and turns. I kind of thought that my character had run his course with the other characters that were around before, but there's a new breed in now, so that means plenty of potential for Warren to come back in and cause some more mayhem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;/&gt;

Speaking of the explanation for Warren surviving, Lomas said, &quot;The saving grace was that they never actually saw my body — all they saw was me getting hit by a mirror. So we're going to do a whole storyline on how Warren got out, what happened and whose body it was that they found badly burnt. It's really exciting and I think the fans are going to love it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lomas interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a284918/jamie-lomas-warren-fox-hollyoaks.html |title=Jamie Lomas (Warren Fox, Hollyoaks) |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-screen, flashback sequences were filmed to show how Warren survived the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;lomas interview&quot;/&gt; ''Hollyoaks'' announced a special episode centred around Warren and how he survived the fire to be broadcast on 1 December 2010, shown to viewers in various flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a287547/hollyoaks-confirms-special-warren-ep.html |title=Hollyoaks confirms special Warren ep |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, it was announced that Lomas had decided to leave the serial once again. Lomas filmed his final scenes in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' star Jamie Lomas to leave soap|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a335234/hollyoaks-star-jamie-lomas-to-leave-soap.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=16 August 2011|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His departure was broadcast on 23 December 2011.

In March 2016, it was announced that Lomas had reprised the role and that Warren would be returning later in the year, Warren returned in May.

Ruth Deller of entertainment website ''[[Lowculture]]'' has often criticised Warren; in one feature she slammed his final storylines stating: &quot;Apparently he's still around and there's some tedious and unlikely 'romance' between him and Sasha. Oh, and he's bedded Swimbint (Sarah Barnes) for good measure. Really, didn't this character's point expire about two years ago now?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/02/28/soapstar-superstars-february/|title=Soapstar Superstars: February|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|author=Deller, Ruth|date=28 February 2009|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gareth McLean of ''[[Radio Times]]'' has been critical of Warren stating: &quot;There are many bad apples in Hollyoaks, but only one that's rotten to the core. Warren Fox has caused so much misery to so many people - Russ, Mercedes, Ste, Cindy, the Barneses, the Deans and don't forget Justin - it's a wonder the villagers haven't ganged up, Murder on the Orient Express-style, and offed him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;holll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Gareth|title=The week in soapland|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/624-soaps-men-behaving-badly/|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=([[BBC Magazines]])|accessdate=2011-01-01|date=1 May 2009&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vP0BZQUi|archivedate=1 January 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frankenstein''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[Death Race (franchise)|Death Race franchise]]. Within the film universe, the character is an alias taken on by other characters who participate in the titular race.

==Character biography==
===''Death Race 2000''===
In the original [[Death Race 2000|1975 film]], Frankenstein is portrayed as the reigning champion of the Death Race, an annual gladiator-style cross-country race. A symbol of the ruling fascist government, he is a feared racer who is purported to be half-man, half-machine.

In reality, it turns out that there have been several Frankensteins over the years – each one recruited by the government to replace their injured or killed predecessors. In this way, with each man donning the same alias and disguise, Frankenstein seems to be an unkillable opponent who survives any crash or injury. The current Frankenstein ([[David Carradine]]), is disillusioned with the government, as well as the race, and he plans to assassinate the tyrannical President (Sandy McCallum). Although his plans to win the race and destroy the government are nearly ruined by the actions of a Resistance movement, he eventually succeeds in both winning and killing the President. He then assumes the office of President himself and puts an end to the Death Race.

===''Death Race''===
In the [[Death Race (film)|2008 remake]] of the 1975 film, ex-race driver Jensen Ames ([[Jason Statham]]) is imprisoned on Terminal Island after he is framed for his wife's murder. Terminal Island is home to a televised gladiator-style race called &quot;Death Race&quot;, and Ames soon finds himself forced to race by the tyrannical Warden Hennessey ([[Joan Allen]]). Ames must assume the mantle of Frankenstein, the current leading racer, whose appearance is covered by a mask. The previous Frankenstein was killed in a fiery crash, though the prison population believes he has simply spent the last six months recovering in the infirmary. The previous Frankenstein had already won four out of five races necessary to secure freedom, requiring Ames to only win one more race. Hennessey explains that Frankenstein is the most popular racer in the history of the race, and ratings would take a sharp hit if his death were announced.

Ames soon learns that Hennessey was behind his wife's murder, using Ulrich ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]), the lead guard, and Pachenko ([[Max Ryan]]), a fellow racer. Ames decides to win the Death Race and use it as means of revenge. With only his crew pit knowing the truth about Frankenstein, Ames goes on to uncover what happened to his predecessor and succeeds in using the race to escape, along with his chief rival, Machine-Gun Joe ([[Tyrese Gibson]]). Afterwards, Coach ([[Ian McShane]]), a member of his pit crew, detonates a bomb in Hennessey's office, killing both her and Ulrich. It is unknown if the Frankenstein mantle was resurrected by the next warden.

===''Death Race 2''===
This [[Death Race 2|prequel]] to the 2008 film reveals the origins of Frankenstein. [[Getaway driver]] Carl &quot;Luke&quot; Lucas ([[Luke Goss]]) is captured after a bank robbery gone bad, in which he was to protect the nephew of crime boss Markus Kane ([[Sean Bean]]). Although loyal and refusing to cooperate with authorities, Lucas is marked for death by Kane because he knows too much. He is sent to Terminal Island and recruited to compete in ''Death Match'', a brutal gladiator-style show, ostensibly run by the aging warden but, in reality, controlled by producer September Jones ([[Lauren Cohan]]).  His fight results in a large-scale prison riot and ultimately spells the end of the controversial show.

''Death Match'' is replaced by ''Death Race'', a gladiatorial race that uses custom cars and unused spaced along the island's outer edges. The prize for winning five races is freedom.  Lucas initially does well but is targeted by the other drivers due to the bounty on his head. When he saves the life of fellow driver 14K ([[Robin Shou]]), 14K pays back this favor by killing Kane. Ultimately, Lucas is driven off the track and ends up in a seemingly fatal crash. However, he returns under a new identity created by Jones, Frankenstein, a horribly scarred racer who wears a mask. However, at the start of his next race, he rams and kills Jones, to the pleasure of her many enemies.

===''Death Race 3: Inferno''===
In the second [[Death Race 3: Inferno|prequel]], a direct bridge to the 2008 film, Lucas' ([[Luke Goss]]) appearance is restored with reconstructive surgery, but he still does not reveal his identity to his pit crew.  However, they discover that Lucas is Frankenstein after his mask is knocked off during a brawl at Kalahari Prison in South Africa, where Lucas and his crew are sent to compete in the first International Death Race. The new race is the brainchild of British billionaire Niles York ([[Dougray Scott]]). Because Lucas has won four of the five races required for his freedom, York demands he throw the final race or face death.

At the end of the race, Lucas crashes his car into the operations center, where York has been handcuffed to a table by his producer, incensed by York firing and replacing her. York is horribly burned in the fiery crash, and the world at large is then led to believe that York is the survived Frankenstein, despite his protestations. Lucas and his crew stage their deaths and escape, while the disfigured York, resigned to the fact that everyone believes he is Frankenstein, adopts the mantle. The film ends with York, now using an American accent (strongly implying that it is he who is the Frankenstein killed at the start of the 2008 film), stating in voiceover, &quot;I am Frankenstein. And I will have my revenge.&quot;

&lt;!--[[File:Frankenstein's 'Monster'.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A portrayal of Frankenstein's Monster, using [[prosthetic makeup]]]]--&gt;
'''Victor Frankenstein''' is the [[title character]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''. He is a [[scientist]] who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as [[Frankenstein's monster]], or often colloquially referred to as simply &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

==History==
The character of Frankenstein was born in [[Naples]] (according to the 1831 edition of the novel) and raised in [[Geneva]]. He was the son of Alphonse Frankenstein and Caroline Beaufort, who died of [[scarlet fever]] when Frankenstein was 17. He describes his ancestry thus: &quot;I am by birth a [[Geneva|Genevese]]; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Mary. ''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus'' Chapter 1 (first sentence)&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenstein has two younger brothers—William, the youngest, and Ernest, the middle child. Frankenstein falls in love with [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], who became his adoptive sister (his blood cousin in the 1818 edition) and, eventually, his fiancée.

As a boy, Frankenstein is interested in the works of [[alchemy|alchemists]] such as [[Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Paracelsus]], and [[Albertus Magnus]], and he longs to discover the fabled [[elixir of life]]. He loses interest in both these pursuits and in [[science]] as a whole after seeing the remains of a tree struck by lightning; however, at the [[University of Ingolstadt]], Frankenstein develops a fondness for [[chemistry]], and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life in inanimate matter through artificial means, pursuing this goal for two years.

Assembling [[Frankenstein's monster|a humanoid creature]] through ambiguous means, Frankenstein successfully brings it to life, but he is horrified by the creature's ugliness. He flees his creation, who disappears and swears revenge on his creator. When William is found murdered, Frankenstein knows instantly that his creation is the killer, but says nothing. The Frankensteins' housekeeper, Justine, is blamed for the boy's death and executed; Frankenstein is wracked with guilt, but does not come forward with the truth because he thinks no one will believe his story, and he is afraid of the reactions such a story would provoke.

The creature approaches Frankenstein and begs him to create a female companion for him. Frankenstein agrees, but ultimately destroys this creation, aghast at the idea of a race of monsters. Enraged, the creature swears revenge; he kills Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend, and promises Frankenstein, &quot;You have denied me my wedding night - I will be with you on yours!&quot; The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth on her matrimonial bed. That same night, Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature.

Frankenstein pursues the &quot;fiend&quot; or &quot;[[Demon]]&quot; (as he calls his creation) to the [[Arctic]] with the intent of destroying it; he ultimately fails in his mission, as he falls through an [[Drift ice|ice floe]] and contracts severe [[pneumonia]]. He is rescued by a ship undergoing an expedition to the [[North Pole]], but dies after relating his tale to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. His creature, upon discovering the death of his creator, is overcome by sorrow and vows to commit [[suicide]] by burning himself alive in &quot;the Northernmost extremity of the globe&quot;; he then disappears, never to be seen or heard from again.

==Characterization==
{{Cleanup|section|date=January 2012}}
While many subsequent film adaptations (notably the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Hammer Films]] series starring [[Peter Cushing]]) have portrayed Frankenstein as the prototypical &quot;[[mad scientist]]&quot;, the novel portrayed him as a [[tragic hero|tragic figure]].

[[Percy Shelley]], Mary's husband, served as a major influence for the character. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sandy | first =Mark | title =Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire | work =[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]  | publisher =The Literary Dictionary Company | date =2002-09-20 | url =http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3010 | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that Percy was one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein; while a student at [[Eton College]], he had &quot;experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions&quot;, and his rooms at [[Oxford University]] were filled with scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) | publisher =Department of English, [[Dickinson College]] | work=Romantic Natural History | url =http://www.dickinson.edu/~nicholsa/Romnat/pbshelley.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy, politically connected country squire, and a descendant of Sir [[Bysshe Shelley]], 1st [[Shelley baronets|Baronet of Castle Goring]], and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Shelley#Ancestry]]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the novel, Frankenstein's family is one of the most distinguished of the Genevese republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Frankenstein had an adopted sister, named Elizabeth. On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley delivered a baby two months premature; the child died two weeks later. Soon after, Percy left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, with whom he was having an affair.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Journal 6 December''&amp;nbsp;– Very Unwell. Shelley &amp; Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places...A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his ''wife''.&quot; Quoted in Spark, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of Frankenstein's responsibility to the creature&amp;nbsp;– in some ways like that of a parent to a child&amp;nbsp;– is one of the main themes of the book.

Obsession plays a major role in the development of Frankenstein's character. First, as a child, he is obsessed with reading books on [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and many [[pseudo-sciences]]. Later, as a young man, he becomes enthralled with the study of [[life sciences]] - mainly dealing with death and the reanimation of corpses. Finally, after the monster is created, Frankenstein is consumed with guilt, despair, and regret, leading him to obsess over the nature of his creation.

===Books===
Beside the original novel, the character also appears or is mentioned in other books from [[pastiche]]s to parodies.

* In the book ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt (novel)|Frankenstein's Aunt]]'', the Baron's aunt comes to Frankenstein's castle to put it back in order, following the chaos caused by her nephew's experiments. In the novel ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt Returns]]'', the doctor has created a child for the monster and his bride.
* In ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', Victor Frankenstein&amp;nbsp;– now going by the alias of Victor Helios&amp;nbsp;– has survived into the present, now living in [[New Orleans]] while arranging for the creation of his 'New Race' of humanity, now growing his creations in tanks after acquiring funding from the likes of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Fidel Castro]] over the centuries. His creations are mentally and emotionally defective, however, and Helios is forced to kill them, all while convinced that it is due to a flaw in his process rather than being able to acknowledge that his own warped views are the reasons his creations break down due to the hopelessness of their lives and inability to find their own purpose. He is opposed in his 'quest' by his original creation&amp;nbsp;– now called Deucalion, who has mastered the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] due to the unique circumstances of his creation&amp;nbsp;– and two New Orleans detectives.
* In [[Kenneth Oppel]]'s novel ''This Dark Endeavor'' and its sequel ''Such Wicked Intent'', Frankenstein is portrayed as a 16-year-old aspiring scientist who creates his own creature from the body of his deceased twin brother, Konrad.

In the 2001 [[Curtis Jobling]] book, ''[[Frankenstein's Cat]]'', it features Frankenstein, sometime before creating his monster, creating a cat called Nine (named because he was made out of nine cats). This book was later adapted into a television series in 2007.

===Film===
[[File:Victor frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frankenstein (1910 film)|Victor Frankenstein (1910 film)]]]]

* Victor Frankenstein's first appearance on screen was in a [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|1910 film]] (produced by [[Thomas Edison]]) in which he seemed more a magician.
* The character's first significant film appearance was in [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], directed by [[James Whale]]. Here, the character is renamed '''Henry Frankenstein''' (a later film shows his tombstone bearing the name '''Heinrich von Frankenstein''') and is played by British actor [[Colin Clive]] opposite [[Boris Karloff]] as the monster. Clive reprised his role in the 1935 sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', which reunited Clive, Whale and Karloff, as well as first giving Frankenstein the official title of Baron. Although the character is not present in the following sequels due to Clive's death in 1937, an oil painting of Frankenstein (as portrayed by Clive) appears in 1939's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; he is also the title character, in spite of having only a cameo, in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942).
* The character gained new life in 1957 when [[Peter Cushing]] first essayed the role (renamed &quot;'''[[Baron Victor von Frankenstein]]'''&quot;) in [[Hammer Films]]' ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'', opposite [[Christopher Lee]] as the Creature. Cushing went on to star as Victor Frankenstein, again identified as a Baron, in five more films for the studio. In contrast to the character portrayed in the novel and earlier films, Cushing's Frankenstein is a ruthless [[megalomania]]c who uses his creation to murder those who stand in his way.
* The 1967 film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' featured Baron Boris von Frankenstein (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]) who is based on Victor Frankenstein. Boris discovers the secret to total destruction and plans to reveal it to the Worldwide Organization of Monsters while announcing his retirement. He has a nephew named Felix Flanken, the son of his youngest sister (an expert in [[witchcraft]]) and a [[medicine man]].
* After Cushing temporarily retired from the role following 1969's ''[[Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed]]'', Hammer decided to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the series for the 1970s. ''[[The Horror of Frankenstein]]'' was a tongue-in-cheek [[black comedy]] remake of ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'', which featured [[Ralph Bates]] as a younger, &quot;hipper&quot; Baron in the sinister mold of Cushing's interpretation. After the film failed to be the success Hammer had hoped for, they brought Cushing back for one final film, in 1974's ''[[Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell]]''.
* The 1972 TV film ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' (a &quot;prequel of sorts&quot; to ''Mad Monster Party?'') featured Baron Henry von Frankenstein (voiced by [[Bob McFadden]] impersonating Boris Karloff). In the TV film, Henry and his assistant [[Igor (character)|Igor]] construct and bring to life a female monster, intended to be the original creature's mate. Frankenstein goes to the Transylvania Astoria Hotel in order to make wedding arrangements.
* [[Udo Kier]] played Baron Victor Frankenstein in 1973's ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]]''. This version of the character is a [[serial killer]] who is married to his own sister.
* [[Leonard Whiting]] played Victor Frankenstein in ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]]'' (1973).
* [[Robert Foxworth]] played Victor Frankenstein in a 1973 television adaptation ''[[Frankenstein (1973 film)|Frankenstein]]''.
* In [[Mel Brooks|Mel Brooks']] 1974 comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', [[Gene Wilder]] portrays [[Frederick Frankenstein]], grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who inherits the family estate but is ashamed of his grandfather's work (to the point of insisting that his name is pronounced &quot;Fronk-en-steen&quot;). He is ultimately inspired to take up the work, eventually creating his own monster (played by [[Peter Boyle]]).
* [[Barrett Oliver]] portrays a young version of Victor Frankenstein in 1984 short film ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', directed by [[Tim Burton]]. [[Charlie Tahan]] plays Victor in the [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|2012 animated remake]].
* [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] appeared as &quot;Charles&quot; Frankenstein in 1985's ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'' opposite [[Clancy Brown]] as the monster.
* [[Raul Julia]] portrayed Frankenstein in [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'' (1990) based on the Brian Aldiss novel.
* In 1992, a [[Frankenstein (1992 film)|made-for-TV film adaptation of ''Frankenstein'']] was produced by David Wickes for [[Turner Pictures]]. It starred [[Patrick Bergin]] as Victor and [[Randy Quaid]] as the monster. In this film, Victor clones himself instead of creating the creature from the dead. In this adaptation, Victor and the monster share a [[psychic]] link, and can sense each other's presence.
* [[Kenneth Branagh]] reinterpreted the character along the lines of Shelley's portrayal in ''[[Frankenstein (1994 film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]]'' (1994) opposite [[Robert De Niro]] as the monster.
* In the 1999 animated film, ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein]]'', Dr. Frankenstein is the main antagonist voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]. After secretly creating the monster in a roller coaster, his lab is discovered by the Chipmunks and sends his creation after them. After the creature had not returned, he goes to the Chipmunks' house and kidnaps Alvin. He then uses a formula that makes Alvin go out of control. After Alvin is returned to normal, Frankenstein in the disguise of the park's mascot Sammy the Squirrel tries to electrocute him, but is electrocuted by his own creation. When he regains conscious, he is unable to get the mask off him. Later near the end of the film, he appears as the theme park's entertainer.
* In the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', Victor Frankenstein (portrayed by [[Samuel West]]) is hired by [[Count Dracula]] to create the monster for Dracula to use to bring his offspring to life. When Frankenstein refuses, Dracula kills him, only to be attacked by the monster. The monster takes Frankenstein's body to the windmill, but an angry mob outside of the castle sees the monster and chases it to the windmill. They set fire to the windmill in order to kill the monster, but are chased off by Dracula and his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]]. The monster survives when the floor on top of the windmill caves in. The monster&amp;nbsp;– which refers to Frankenstein as his/its father&amp;nbsp;– is later used to bring Dracula's offspring to life, only to escape from the castle with help from monster hunter [[Gabriel Van Helsing]].
* The 2004 independent movie ''[[Frankenstein (2004 film)|Frankenstein]]'' features a Victor Frankenstein known as Victor Helios (portrayed by [[Thomas Kretschmann]]), who has used his own research to extend his life into the modern day, where he continues his experiments to create life with the goal of replacing humanity with his own creatures. He is opposed by his original creation, who is determined to defeat his creator while being hampered by a mental 'block' Helios has installed in all his creatures to prevent them harming him.
* The 2004 made-for-TV Hallmark production of ''Frankenstein'' starred [[Alec Newman]] as Victor Frankenstein opposite of [[Luke Goss]] as the monster.
* The 2007 film ''[[Frankenstein (2007 film)|Frankenstein]]'' introduces Victoria Frankenstein. Instead of making the creature out of corpses, she uses [[stem cell]]s, intending to use her experiment to save her dying son. The experiment goes wrong, however, and the creature escapes. When Frankenstein catches up with the monster, she comes to love it because it is her only remaining link to her son who has since died.
* Victor Frankenstein briefly appears in the 2014 film ''[[I, Frankenstein]]'', in which he is played by [[Aden Young]].
* Victor Frankenstein was portrayed by [[James McAvoy]] in the 2015 film ''[[Victor Frankenstein (film)|Victor Frankenstein]]''. In this version, he rescues Igor ([[Daniel Radcliffe]]) - formerly an unnamed hunchback from a circus who impressed Victor with his exceptional self-taught medical skills - to enlist him as his partner in creating life, later attributing his desire as a means of making up for a childhood incident where his elder brother died in a blizzard. Although Victor acknowledges that his first human creation has no true spark of life in it, the film concludes with him speculating how he shall improve his project for the future.

===Television===
* Victor Frankenstein is mentioned as the creator of [[Herman Munster]] of the series ''[[The Munsters]]'', but does not appear in the series. At Herman and Lily's wedding, Frankenstein gave Herman away &quot;with his blueprints.&quot; He is currently dead. In &quot;A Visit from Johann,&quot; (1966) the episode introduced the great great grandson of Victor Frankenstein named Victor Frankenstein IV (played by [[John Abbott (actor)|John Abbott]]).
* In ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' episode &quot;The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein,&quot; the Dr. Frankenstein (voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]) that is featured is depicted as the great-great-grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein who carries on the &quot;family tradition&quot; of creating monsters. He is assisted by an Igor-like henchman named Gork (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]). Dr. Frankenstein uses his monsters to take revenge on the Transylvanians for what they did to his ancestor. When he unleashes the classic Frankenstein's monster to attack Transylvania, the Super Friends are called in to investigate. When [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] attack the monster, Dr. Frankenstein orders his creation to lure the Dynamic Duo to his castle in order to trap them. When Batman and Robin short-circuit Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Frankenstein arrives and traps them while thanking them for giving him an idea for his next creation. First, Dr. Frankenstein transfers Batman's abilities to the target body. Robin manages to escape and calls in [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. When the arrive, Dr. Frankenstein unleashes on them a tentacled, [[Kryptonite]]-powered, tar creature. Dr. Frankenstein then transfers Superman and Wonder Woman's abilities into the target body for his next monster. Thus creating a composite monster who has Batman's head, cape, and genius-level intellect, Superman's body and super abilities, and Wonder Woman's magic lasso, magic bracelets, and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers. Dr. Frankenstein sends his Super-Monster to attack Europe while Robin and [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] free Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. With help from the Austrian Energy Research Institute, Robin undergoes the same experiment that created the Super-Monster granting him the powers of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Robin and the Super-Monster are evenly matched until Robin dons a lead suit and exposes the Super-Monster to Kryptonite. Robin defeats the Super-Monster while Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Gleek apprehend Dr. Frankenstein and Gork followed by them regaining their powers by reversing the experiment.
* The humorous TV series ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt]]'' features a Dr. Frankenstein who creates a typical Frankenstein's monster. As in the [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the character is renamed Henry Frankenstein (portrayed by [[Bolek Polívka]]).
* In ABC's fairy tale drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Dr. Frankenstein is one of many characters brought to the Storybrooke by [[Regina Mills|the Evil Queen]] under the alias Dr. Whale, and serves as a recurring character throughout the show's run. He works at the local hospital, and was responsible for creating the show's version of [[Frankenstein%27s_monster|the monster]] when he tries to resurrect his dead brother, Gerhardt. 
* The [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'' features Dr. Victor Frankenstein (voiced by [[Jeff B. Davis]]) and other characters from both the novel ''Frankenstein'' and other classic horror films. Frankenstein is depicted as being a narcissist who, after drinking an immortality serum he invented, has lived for more than a thousand years. He has developed the technology to connect his village to various points in time, called Frankenholes, that allow various people from history to time travel to visit him in the hopes he will do some sort of miraculous surgery to fix physical and mental flaws.
* The 2014 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' depicts Dr. Victor Frankenstein (played by [[Harry Treadaway]]) as a young morgue worker in England during the late 1800s. He creates his monster &quot;Caliban&quot; (played by [[Rory Kinnear]]) by attaching a cadaver to a system of circuits and running electricity through it during a lightning storm. Unlike other adaptions, Victor creates two more creations: Proteus and Lily.

===Theatre===
* The 2007 [[Off-Broadway]] musical, ''[[Frankenstein – A New Musical]]'' portrays Victor Frankenstein as the naïve young student of Mary Shelley's original novel.

'''Frankenstein's monster''', sometimes known as '''Frankenstein''', is a fictional character who first appeared in [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2002/septemberoctober/feature/its-alive |title='It's Alive' |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], to the mythological character [[Prometheus]], who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.  Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature is often referred to by his creator's surname, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

In Shelley's [[Gothic fiction|Gothic story]], Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his [[laboratory]] through an ambiguous method consisting of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. Shelley describes the monster as {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, hideously ugly, but sensitive and emotional.  The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], the monster occupies &quot;a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Caroll, Joseph et al.  ''Graphing Jane Austen: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 p. 30] (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namelessness==
[[File:Frankenstein Cooke 1823.jpg|thumb|left|The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|T. P. Cooke]] as the monster in an 1823 stage production of Shelley's novel]]

Mary Shelley's original novel never ascribes an actual name to the monster; although when speaking to his creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], the monster does call himself the &quot;[[Adam]] of your labours&quot; (in reference to the first man created in the [[Bible]]).  Victor refers to the monster as &quot;creature&quot;, &quot;fiend&quot;, &quot;spectre&quot;, &quot;the [[demon]]&quot;, &quot;wretch&quot;, &quot;[[devil]]&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, and &quot;[[ogre]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldick|first=Chris|title=In Frankenstein's shadow: myth, monstrosity, and nineteenth-century writing|year=1987|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|id=ISBN 0198117264 |isbn=9780198117261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become common vernacular to refer to the creature by the name &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, though this never actually happens in the book.

As in Shelley's story, the monster's namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in London and Paris during the decades after the novel's first appearance.  In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of ''[[Richard Brinsley Peake|Presumption]]'', the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. &quot;The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of [[dramatis personae]] came _________, by Mr T. Cooke,&quot; she wrote to her friend [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]]. &quot;This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good.&quot;&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=George E.|title=Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form|year=1989|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park|id=ISBN 0271006455|isbn=9780271006451|pages=37|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/haggerty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade of publication, the name of the creator—Frankenstein—was used to refer to the monster, but it did not become firmly established until much later. The story was adapted for the stage in 1927 by [[Peggy Webling]],&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchcock|first=Susan Tyler|title=Frankenstein: a cultural history|year=2007|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393061444|id=ISBN 0393061442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Webling's Victor Frankenstein does give the creature his name. However, the monster has no name in the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] film series starring [[Boris Karloff]] during the 1930s, which was largely based upon Webling's play.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William and Young, Nancy.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrK1dFXqT78C&amp;pg=PA199 ''The 1930s''], p. 199 (Greenwood Publishing Group 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 Universal film]] treated the monster's identity in a similar way as Shelley's novel: in the opening credits, the character is referred to merely as &quot;The Monster&quot; (the actor's name is replaced by a question mark, but Karloff is listed in the closing credits).&lt;ref&gt;Schor, Esther. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0QeWS3z0BwC&amp;pg=PA82 ''The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley''], p. 82 (Cambridge U. Press 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the creature soon enough became best known in the popular imagination as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard the monster sense of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as well-established and not an error.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Bergen|title=Comfortable Words|year=1962|publisher=New York|location=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=A dictionary of modern American usage|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|id=ISBN 0195078535|isbn=9780195078534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern practice varies somewhat. For example, in ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', first published in 2004, the creature is named &quot;Deucalion&quot;, after the [[Deucalion|character]] from [[Greek Mythology]], who is the son of the titan [[Prometheus]], a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which first aired in 2014; Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation &quot;Adam&quot;, before deciding instead to let the monster &quot;pick his own name&quot;. Thumbing through a book of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the monster chooses &quot;Proteus&quot; from ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the ''second'' monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named &quot;Caliban&quot;, from ''[[The Tempest]]'', by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet [[John Clare]].

==Shelley's plot==
[[Image:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Stanton Ogle]] in the 1910 film version.]]
{{main|Frankenstein}}
As told by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguously described [[scientific method]] consisting of [[chemistry]] (from his time as a student at [[University of Ingolstadt]]) and [[alchemy]] (largely based on the writings of [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]). Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness. 

He finds brief solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of [[peasant]]s.  Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family's [[blindness|blind]] father, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Hopeful but bewildered, the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her. He finds Frankenstein's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory, and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him. 

The monster kills Victor's younger brother William upon learning of the boy's relation to his hated creator. When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate. In return, he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail. Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys his experiment. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride [[Elizabeth Lavenza]] on their wedding night; whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation. Searching for the monster in the [[Arctic Circle]], Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe [[pneumonia]]. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship; but, upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at &quot;the Northernmost extremity of the globe&quot;. He then departs, never to be seen again.

==Appearance==
[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|[[Boris Karloff]] as the classic 1930s film version with an assist from [[makeup artist]] [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]]]
Shelley described Frankenstein's monster as an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, hideously ugly creation, with translucent yellowish skin pulled so taut over the body that it &quot;barely disguised the workings of the arteries and muscles underneath&quot;; watery, glowing eyes, flowing black hair, black lips, and prominent white teeth. The monster attempts to integrate himself into human society, but is shunned by all who see him. This compels him to seek revenge against his creator. A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.

The best-known image of Frankenstein's monster in [[popular culture]] derives from [[Boris Karloff]]'s portrayal in the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' in which he wore makeup applied, and according to a format designed by, [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack P. Pierce]] and possibly suggested by director [[James Whale]]. [[Universal Studios]], which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] took over the part from Karloff in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]];'' [[Bela Lugosi]] portrayed the role in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]];'' and [[Glenn Strange]] played the monster in the last three [[Universal Studios]] films to feature the character - ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]],'' ''[[House of Dracula]],'' and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].'' But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. To this day, the image of Karloff's face is owned by his daughter's company, Karloff Enterprises, for which Universal replaced Karloff's features with Glenn Strange's in most of their marketing.

Since Karloff's portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, [[undead]]-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OyVey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey!: how Jewish history, culture, and values shaped the comic book superhero | publisher=Leviathan Press | year=2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | pages=82–97 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 TV mini-series ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]],'' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster: [[Michael Sarrazin]] appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.

In the 1994 film ''[[Frankenstein (1994 film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]],'' the creature is played by [[Robert De Niro]] in a nearer approach to the original source, except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, [[Doctor Waldman]], while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman's &quot;trace memories&quot; that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.

In the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]],'' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is {{convert|8|to-|9|ft|cm}} tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart. It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs, essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.

In 2004, a TV mini-series adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein (US TV miniseries)|Frankenstein]]'' was made by [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]]. [[Luke Goss]] plays The Creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.

The 2014 TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of Shelley's description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. In this series, the monster names himself &quot;[[Caliban]]&quot;, after the character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.

==Personality==
[[File:House of Frankenstein (Strange and Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Glenn Strange]] as Frankenstein's monster with [[Boris Karloff]], this time playing another character, in the 1944 film ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'']]
As depicted by Shelley, the monster is a sensitive, emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'', and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.

From the beginning, the monster is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his &quot;birth&quot; that even his own creator cannot stand being around him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says &quot;…one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped…&quot;.&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;{{cite web|last=Shelley|first=Mary Wollstonecraft|title=Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm|work=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.5}} Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too cannot stand to see himself. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.

Contrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well. The ''Van Helsing'' and ''Penny Dreadful'' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character's violent reactions to rejection.

In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the monster is depicted as [[Muteness|mute]] and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal's &quot;abnormal&quot; brain. In the subsequent sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. In the second sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', but the dialogue was excised before release. The monster was effectively mute in later sequels, though he is heard to refer to [[Count Dracula]] as his &quot;master&quot; in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. The monster is often portrayed as being [[Pyrophobia|afraid of fire]].

==The monster as a metaphor==
[[File:Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin (5282830195).jpg|thumb|Frankenstein's monster's bust in the [[National Museum of Cinema]] of [[Turin]], [[Italy]].]]
Scholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley’s story, and have analogized the monster to a motherless child; Shelley’s own mother died while giving birth to her.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;Milner, Andrew. ''Literature, Culture and Society,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9C1Xdzyx4C&amp;pg=PA227 227, 230] (Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized &quot;the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.&quot;&lt;ref name=Milner /&gt;  Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled technology.&lt;ref&gt;Coghill, Jeff.  ''CliffsNotes on Shelley's Frankenstein,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHM5oZd8WkC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30] (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposal is that the character of Dr. Frankenstein was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus--[[Benjamin Franklin]]. Accordingly, the monster would represent the new nation that Franklin helped to create out of remnants left by England.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;Young, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=65fCSOpahAwC&amp;pg=PA34 Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor], p. 34 (NYU Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Frankenstein's father &quot;made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds,&quot; wrote Shelley, similar to Franklin's famous [[kite experiment]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

&quot;'''Frankie Teardrop'''&quot; is a song by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] from the band's acclaimed first album ''[[Suicide (1977 album)|Suicide]]'', which was released in 1977. The song tells a story of a young father and [[poverty]]-stricken [[factory worker]] whose destitution drives him to [[insanity]]. One day, Frankie comes home from work, murders his wife and child, and then commits [[suicide]]. The narrative then continues to follow him into [[hell]]. The musical backing on the song is sparse, featuring just a simple keyboard [[riff]], [[drum machine]], and the vocal line, creating a chilling atmosphere. Singer [[Alan Vega]]'s &quot;Dark, inhuman screams&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/suicide-first-album-r19328/review/|title=Suicide (first album) review on Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; add to the [[claustrophobic]] nature of the piece.

==Reviews==
The track received many reviews due to both its disturbing nature ([[Nick Hornby]] in his book ''[[31 Songs]]'' described it as something you would listen to &quot;Only once&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornby&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=31 Songs|author=Nick Hornby|publisher=McSweeney's}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for its political viewpoint, by [[Allmusic]] as &quot;More literally and poetically political than the work of bands who wore their radical philosophies on their sleeve&quot;. [[Bruce Springsteen]] has cited that he loves this song in interviews, and that it was an influence on his album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Ward|title=State Trooper - Bruce Springsteen|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/state-trooper-mt0008672556|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] cited it as &quot;[The track that] gets most of the ink&quot; in terms of critical acclaim, and jokingly as &quot;[[Taxi Driver (film)|''Taxi Driver'']]: The Musical&quot; when citing the album ''Suicide'' in its 100 Greatest ’70s Albums list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/7/|title=Pitchfork's top 100 of the 1970's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Miles &quot;C-Note&quot; Franklin''', played by [[Rockmond Dunbar]], is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United States|American]] [[television series]], ''[[Prison Break]]''. The character was introduced as a prisoner in the [[Pilot (Prison Break episode)|pilot episode]]. The actor was promoted from a recurring guest star to a regular cast member midway through the first season.

==Background==
Franklin was a [[First Sergeant]] in the [[U.S. Army]], stationed in [[Kuwait]]. While serving as a guard for a detention facility, he uncovered a shocking practice (illegally torturing several detainees) and reported it to his commander. C-Note's commander [[dishonorably discharged]] him for his involvement in black-market activities after C-Note refused to agree to keep quiet about the incident. With the shame of dishonorable discharge hanging over him, C-Note had great difficulty finding other jobs to support his wife Kacee and daughter Dede, so he resorted to criminal means. His brother-in-law, Darius Morgan ([[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]]) was a truck driver and suggested that he could help transport stolen goods. Eventually, C-Note was caught and because he would not give up the identities of his friends, he was sent to [[Fox River State Penitentiary]]. He told his wife and daughter that he was getting shipped back to [[Iraq]] (as he had not even told them of his discharge from the Army). He begged his [[brother-in-law]] not to let them know he was going to be imprisoned. Once inside Fox River, C-Note eventually starts working in the prison kitchen and gains a reputation as the &quot;prison pharmacist&quot;, being able to acquire any item or substance for other inmates for $100, or a &quot;C-Note&quot; (which, in conjunction with his namesake's appearance on the bill, spawns his nickname).

==Appearances==
C-Note's first appearance in the series was in the pilot and was a recurring character in the first 2 episodes.  According to an interview with Rockmond Dunbar C-Note was only supposed to appear in these 2 episodes but when the show was picked up for a full season C-Note's role was extended to a recurring character after the thirteenth episode of the first season.

=== Season 1 ===
C-Note makes his first appearance in the pilot episode when [[Michael Scofield]] asks him to obtain some [[PUGNAc]] to allow Michael to feign [[diabetes]] and thus gain access to the infirmary (a critical aspect of his escape plan). C-Note is curious to know his motives, but Michael refuses to tell him. In &quot;[[Allen (Prison Break episode)|Allen]]&quot;, C-Note refuses to deal with Michael after seeing him associating with [[Theodore &quot;T-Bag&quot; Bagwell|T-Bag]], leader of a [[white supremacist]] group in the prison. He later reconsiders after seeing Michael apparently fighting one of T-Bag's men during a riot, though his curiosity is not diminished. C-Note is then absent for six episodes, but eventually returns to the show with a minor role in the episode &quot;[[Tweener (Prison Break episode)|Tweener]]&quot;, where he becomes suspicious of the PI crew when he realizes that they are discarding pieces of concrete across the prison yard, from the hole they are digging in the break room. C-Note plays a bigger role in the next episode &quot;[[Sleight of Hand (Prison Break episode)|Sleight of Hand]].&quot; After the PI head, [[List of Prison Break characters#John Abruzzi|John Abruzzi]] is briefly replaced by Gus Fiorello, C-Note bribes him to work in PI. He quickly discovers the hole that Michael and his crew had dug as part of the escape plan. When Abruzzi regained control of PI, C-Note threatens the crew to let him on board or he would tell the guards. The others reluctantly agree. He is initially a source of friction on the team, often questioning other characters’ actions, and in the episode &quot;[[Odd Man Out (Prison Break episode)|Odd Man Out]]&quot; he attempts to conspire against Michael by turning his cellmate, [[Fernando Sucre]], against him. 

C-Note is one of six inmates involved in the first failed escape attempt in &quot;[[End of the Tunnel (Prison Break episode)|End of the Tunnel]].&quot; In the same episode, it is revealed that the character has a wife and daughter on the outside, whom he has tricked into thinking that he is serving in the military overseas. When Abruzzi is temporarily written out of the show, C-Note replaces him as a main character from episode 14 and onwards. He later becomes a respected member of the team in the season’s later episodes, helping the team out of several problems that nearly derails the escape plan. He also befriends fellow escapee [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Charles Westmoreland|Charles Westmoreland]] as they both share the same need to see their family again. One consequence of his joining the escape team, however, is C-Note being ostracized by other black inmates, ironically for the same reason C-Note had initially refused to deal with Michael: consorting with T-Bag, who had also joined the escape team. This becomes a plot point in &quot;[[Bluff (Prison Break episode)|Bluff]]&quot;, and the subplot continues through the next few episodes. C-Note has two violent encounters with his former associates and Trumpets, the leader of one of the black gangs, issues a death mark on his head in the episode &quot;Go.&quot; Only the escape prevents him from being killed. After the &quot;Fox River Eight's&quot; escape from the prison, C-Note, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre and Abruzzi meet bigger problems as their escape plane takes off and leaves them stranded with numerous police on their trail, forcing them to run into the woods in a desperate attempt to evade their pursuers.

=== Season 2 ===

In the second season, C-Note’s storyline alternates between his participation in the search for Westmoreland’s money, as well as a separate subplot in which the character seeks to reunite with his family. After parting ways with the other escapees in &quot;Otis&quot;, C-Note travels to Utah and eventually reunites with other members of the Fox River Eight in &quot;Subdivision.&quot; In these episodes, C-Note returns to his earlier role as the one who instigates tension amongst the escape team, especially between him and T-Bag. The fugitives spend several episodes digging for the money and ultimately find it. However, C-Note and the others are apparently betrayed by Sucre, who double crosses them all and demands the money while holding them at gun point. Left empty-handed, C-Note returns to Chicago, where he attempts to re-unite with his family in &quot;Unearthed.&quot;

Made aware of his fugitive status in the episode &quot;[[Scan (Prison Break episode)|Scan]]&quot;, his wife Kacee is very upset to learn the truth and is initially uncertain if she should stay loyal to her husband. However, she later decides to stand by him. In the episode &quot;[[Unearthed (Prison Break episode)|Unearthed]]&quot;, C-Note meets up with his old friends and asks them for help to escape with Kacee and Dede. They are narrowly able to avoid capture by federal agents, and C-Note is reunited with his wife and daughter at the end of the episode.

After being absent for 2 episodes, C-Note and his family resurfaces in North Dakota, in the episode &quot;[[Disconnect (Prison Break episode)|Disconnect]]&quot;, having a good time until his daughter complains of stomach problems as they have left her medicine behind. Kacee attempts to purchase more medication at a nearby pharmacy, but is identified by the clerk and taken into police custody. C-Note, horrified, can only watch in shock from his hiding place as his wife is arrested and taken away. In the season’s later episodes, the character becomes increasingly desperate. In &quot;[[John Doe (Prison Break episode)|John Doe]]&quot;, a guilt-ridden C-Note attempts to have his wife skip bail, only to learn that Kacee's bail is denied. The episodes &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; then focuses on C-Note trying to take care of his daughter. In &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, he attempts to find medical care for the increasingly ill Dede. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Mahone has received a report that C-Note was spotted in Minnesota and arrives to pursue him. At the end of the episode, Dede’s health rapidly deteriorates, and C-Note is forced to give himself up to save his daughter’s life. He also makes a deal with Agent Mahone to release his wife in exchange for C-Note’s co-operation with trying to find Michael Scofield. In his last scene of the episode, C-Note is being led away in handcuffs.

His last three episodes feature C-Note in custody and unsuccessfully trying to help Mahone to track down Michael. After Mahone no longer has need for C-Note, he is pressured by the nefarious Company to ensure C-Note’s death. Mahone reluctantly urges C-Note to hang himself, threatening his family if he does not obey. The episode ends with a cliffhanger as C-Note attempts to hang himself in his cell. In the next episode, however, he is rescued by the guards. Mahone’s subordinate, Agent Wheeler, then questions C-Note and promises him protection in exchange for his testimony against Mahone. In the episode &quot;Panama&quot;, C-Note agrees to the deal put forward by Wheeler and Internal Affairs Agent Sullins. In return, C-Note is released from prison and placed in the [[Witness Protection Program]] with his family. In his last scene of the season, C-Note is seen walking away with his wife and daughter to start a new life. The actor retains his name in the opening credits for the last two episodes of season 2, but does not appear. &quot;Panama&quot; is his last appearance as a regular cast member. He is the first principal character to have been written out without being killed off from the series and the first member of the Fox River Eight to be set free by the authorities.

=== Season 4 ===
Rockmond Dunbar reprises his role in the last two episodes of Prison Break. After he tracks down Sucre, C-Note explains that he is on the run again due to Internal Affairs refusing to hold up their end of the deal and that he has been contacted by a mysterious man (Paul Kellerman) and asked to locate Michael and Lincoln to help them destroy The Company. In the series finale, C-Note and Sucre save the brothers from certain death and later receive full exoneration for their efforts. In the series epilogue, C-Note is revealed to have become a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] deliveryman, matching his specialty in prison: to get his fellow inmates any random material.

=== Characteristics ===
As one of the Fox River Eight escapees, C-Note's main specialty revolves around being able to smuggle any random material in and out of any given territory. Apparently, this was also notified by his commanding officer right before he was dishonorably discharged. He also has an observant side about him, as he is the only one whom Scofield reluctantly recruited for the escape to have figured out what Abruzzi's PI crew were conducting on the break room on his own. While he genuinely respects Scofield as the man who broke them out of jail, C-Note, like any other father, cares more for his family and going even as far as handing Michael out to Mahone in exchange for his family's safety as well as attempting a suicide. When Roy Geary smugly stole an object of sentimental value from Westmoreland (whom C-Note forced into handing over to keep the plan safe), his immediate expression was anger. Franklin is a Muslim.

==Production details==
C-Note reporting the abuse of prisoners of war in Kuwait was inspired by the [[Abu Ghraib scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Episode commentary by Paul Scheuring, cast and crew, S1E16, &quot;[[Brother's Keeper (Prison Break episode)|Brother's Keeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis T. &quot;Mickey&quot; Featherstone''' (born June 3, 1949) is a former [[Irish Mob|Irish American mobster]] and member of [[the Westies]], an [[organized crime]] syndicate from [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], led by [[James Coonan]]. Featherstone committed several mob killings before he was convicted in 1986 of a murder he had not committed. Facing a quarter of a century in jail, he became an informant and brought down Coonan's gang.

==Early life==
Featherstone was born on West 43rd St.,&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; one of nine children.&lt;ref name=ghosts&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oucCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|title=The Ghosts of Hell's Kitchen|last=Daly|first=Michael|author2=John Hamill|date=12 April 1982|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother helped with the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and his father was a customs officer.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He had blond hair and was often said to be baby-faced.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served in the [[Vietnam War]] as member of the [[Green Berets]] aged just 17 after lying about his age.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served as a stock clerk.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-thoroughly-vicious-gang.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Books of The Times; The Rise and Fall of a Thoroughly Vicious Gang|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|date=16 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his disappointment, he did not see combat, although he was circumcised by his friends in a drunken prank.&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=stories&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/books/new-york-stories-hell-s-kitchen-killers.html|title=New York Stories: Hell's Kitchen Killers|last=Bain|first=David Haward|date=8 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[military discharge|medical discharge]] in 1967 after just a year, claiming to have hallucinations.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==Return to Hell's Kitchen==
When a group from New Jersey entered Hell's Kitchen and a fight started with the outsiders, Featherstone returned with a rifle and shot one of them in the side, for which he was arrested and probationed.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He shot dead Linwood Willis in a confrontation outside a bar in 1971, but was found not guilty due to insanity.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He spent time in a series of [[mental hospitals]], being released in 1975. He would act out frequently while in the hospitals, leading to him being restrained and injected with [[thorazine]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He began spending time in saloons like Club 596 and Sunbrite that were hangouts for the Westies.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==The Westies==
Featherstone's penchant for violence and intimidation caught the eye of Coonan and Featherstone became Coonan's right-hand man by 1976.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; [[Mickey Spillane (mobster)|Mickey Spillane]], the mob leader in Hell's Kitchen at the time, was shot five times outside his apartment in August 1977, and Featherstone was arrested but acquitted for his killing.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; The police suspected him of a series of mob [[contract killing]]s. He went on trial with Coonan for the killing of a barman, but they were acquitted in December 1979 after one witness killed himself and another refused to testify.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He was finally jailed after using fake currency at a massage parlor - he was traced because the girl remembered seeing his name tattooed on his forearm. Featherstone did time in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield Missouri on the psychiatric ward in 1982. He was a model prisoner, seen daily picking fine lint off of his perfectly made bunk to pass inspection, and starting arguments with others for not polishing their door frame brass. The institution kept Featherstone working on the ward, out of General Population, for his own safety. In February 1982, he was sentenced to six years in jail for counterfeiting.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

Featherstone and Coonan had a falling out over the latter's alliance with the [[Gambino crime family]], which Featherstone saw as a betrayal of all the Irish-Americans in Hell's Kitchen.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt;

===Turning informer===
Featherstone was convicted in March 1986 for the April 1985 murder of Michael Holly, despite being innocent of this particular murder, which was a revenge attack probably carried out by another of the Westies, [[Billy Bokun]].&lt;ref name=lords&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/magazine/the-lord-s-of-hell-s-kitchen.html?src=pm|title=The Lords of Hell's Kitchen|last=Traub|first=James|date=5 April 1987|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked at receiving his sentence of 25 years in jail, and concluded that he had been framed by his own gang.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; Rather than serving his sentence he instead told prosecutors that Bokun had committed the murder, and he became an [[informant]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=informed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/01/nyregion/admitted-westies-killer-who-informed-is-free.html|title=Admitted Westies Killer Who Informed Is Free|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|date=1 January 1989|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Sissy co-operated with the District Attorney's office to tape incriminating conversations with gang members, including Bokun.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; In September 1986, Judge [[Alvin Schlesinger]] overturned Featherstone's conviction.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; His testimony at Coonan's racketeering trial during 1987-8 helped to bring down Coonan's gang.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; He pleaded guilty to a [[racketeering]] charge and received a suspended sentence of five years probation from Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] due to his cooperation with the authorities.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; He was freed in December 1988&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; and went into a [[witness protection]] program.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt;

'''Raymond Martinez Fernandez''' (December 17, 1914 &amp;ndash; March 8, 1951) and '''Martha Jule Beck''' (May 6, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 8, 1951) were an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] couple. They are believed to have killed as many as 20 women during their murderous spree between 1947 and 1949. After their arrest and trial for [[serial murder]] in 1949, they became known as &quot;'''[[Lonely hearts killer|The Lonely Hearts Killers]]'''&quot; for meeting their unsuspecting victims through [[Personal ads|lonely hearts ads]]. A number of films and television shows are based on this case.

==Prior to the murders==

===Raymond Fernandez===
Raymond Martinez Fernandez was born on December 17, 1914 in Hawaii to [[Spanish people|Spanish]] parents. Shortly thereafter, they moved to [[Connecticut]]. As an adult, he moved to [[Spain]], married, and had four children, all of whom he abandoned later on in life.

After serving in Spain's Merchant Marine and then [[British Intelligence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 4)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/4.html |title=The Lonely Hearts Killers|publisher= Trutv.com|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]], Fernandez decided to seek work.

===Martha Beck===
Martha Beck was born '''Martha Jule Seabrook''' on May 6, 1920 in [[Milton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GS%7Cn=beck&amp;GSfn=martha&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GSsr=161&amp;GRid=27327468&amp;df=all&amp; |website=Find-a-Grave|title= Martha Jule Seabrook Beck |accessdate= February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly due to a [[gland]]ular problem (then a common explanation for obesity), she was [[overweight]] and underwent [[premature puberty|puberty prematurely]].  At her trial, she claimed to have been [[Child sexual abuse|sexually assaulted]] by her brother. When she told her mother what happened, her mother beat her, claiming Martha was responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/2.html|title= The Lonely Hearts Killers|publisher= Trutv.com|page =2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teen, Beck ran away from home.

After Martha finished school, she studied nursing but had trouble finding a job due to her weight. She initially became an [[undertaker]]'s assistant and prepared female bodies for burial. She then quit that job and moved to California, where she worked in an Army hospital as a nurse. She engaged in sexually promiscuous behavior and eventually became [[pregnant]]. She tried to convince the father to marry her, but he refused. Single and pregnant, she returned to Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;/&gt;

Martha told people the father was a serviceman she had married, later claiming he had been killed in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]]. The town mourned her loss, and the story was published in the local newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;/&gt; Shortly after her daughter was born, she became pregnant again by a [[Pensacola]] bus driver named Alfred Beck. They married quickly and [[divorce]]d six months thereafter, and she gave birth to a son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 3)&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/3.html |title=The Lonely Hearts Killers| publisher=Trutv.com| page =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployed and the single mother of two young children, Beck escaped into a [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] world, buying romance magazines and [[romance novel|novel]]s, and watching romantic movies. In 1946, she found employment at the Pensacola Hospital for Children. She placed a lonely hearts ad in 1947, which Raymond Fernandez answered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 3)&quot;/&gt;

==Murders==
Fernandez visited Beck and stayed for a short time; she told everyone they were to be married. He returned to [[New York City]] while she made preparations in [[Milton, Florida]], where she lived. When she was abruptly fired from her job, she packed up and arrived on his doorstep in New York. Fernandez enjoyed the way she catered to his every whim, and when he learned she had left her children for him, he thought it was a sign of an unconditional love. He confessed his criminal enterprises to Beck, who quickly sent her children to the [[Salvation Army]] in order to assist Fernandez without hindrances. She posed as Fernandez's sister, giving him an air of respectability. Their victims, feeling more secure knowing there was another woman in the house, often agreed to stay with the pair. Beck also convinced some victims that she lived alone and that her &quot;brother&quot; was only a guest. Beck was extremely jealous and would go to great lengths to make sure Fernandez and his &quot;intended&quot; never consummated their relationship. When he did have sex with a woman, Beck subjected both to her violent temper.

In 1949, the pair committed the three murders for which they would later be convicted. Janet Fay, 66, became engaged to Fernandez and went to stay at his [[Long Island]] apartment. When Beck caught her in bed with Fernandez, she smashed Fay's head in with a hammer in a murderous rage. Fernandez then strangled Fay. Fay's family became suspicious when she disappeared, and Fernandez and Beck fled.

Beck and Fernandez traveled to Byron Center Road in [[Wyoming, Michigan|Wyoming Township, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave her sleeping pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor and began to cry, which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if she saw her bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police to arrive at the door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gado&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gado|first=Mark|title=
Death Row Women: Murder, Justice, and the New York Press|year=2007|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0275993612|pages=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and executions==
Fernandez quickly confessed, with the understanding that they would not be [[extradition|extradited]] to New York; [[Michigan]] had no [[death penalty]], but New York did. They were, nonetheless, extradited. The pair vehemently denied committing 17 murders that were attributed to them, and Fernandez tried to retract his confession, saying he made it only to protect Beck.

Their trial was sensationalized, with lurid tales of sexual perversity.  Newspaper reporters described Beck's appearance with derision, and she wrote protesting letters to the editors. Fernandez and Beck were convicted of Janet Fay's murder—the only one for which they were tried—and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. On March 8, 1951, both were executed by [[Joseph Francel]]&lt;ref&gt;Murderpedia: [http://murderpedia.org/male.F/f/fernandez-raymond.htm Raymond Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murderpedia: [http://murderpedia.org/female.B/b/beck-martha.htm Martha Beck]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[electric chair]].

Despite their tumultuous arguments and relationship problems, they often professed their love to each other, as demonstrated by their official last words:

&quot;I wanna shout it out; I love Martha! What do the public know about love?&quot; - Raymond Fernandez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuchs&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuchs|first=Christian|title=Bad Blood|year=1996|publisher=Creation Books|isbn=1-84068-025-3|pages=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;My story is a love story. But only those tortured by love can know what I mean. I am not unfeeling, stupid or moronic. I am a woman who had a great love and always will have it. Imprisonment in the Death House has only strengthened my feeling for Raymond.&quot; - Martha Beck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuchs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Jay Robert (1986): ''Look for the Woman''.

'''Pedro Rodrigues Filho''' (born 17 June 1954 in [[Santa Rita do Sapucaí]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[serial killer]]. Nicknamed '''Pedrinho Matador''' (Killer Petey) and arrested in 1973, in 2003 he was convicted of murdering at least 71 people and sentenced to 128 years in prison.

== Biography ==
Pedro Rodrigues Filho was born on a farm in [[Santa Rita do Sapucaí]], southern [[Minas Gerais]] state, with an injured [[human skull|skull]], the result of beatings his father had inflicted upon his mother's womb during a fight. Filho said his first urge to kill happened at the age of 13. During a fight with an older cousin, he pushed the boy into a sugar cane press. The boy almost died.

At the age of 14, he murdered the vice-Mayor of [[Alfenas]], [[Minas Gerais]], because he fired his father, a school guard, at the time accused of stealing the school kitchen's food. Then he murdered another guard, supposedly the real thief.

He took refuge in [[Mogi das Cruzes]], São Paulo, where he began a series of burglaries and murdered a drug dealer. There he also met Maria Aparecida Olympia, a woman he then lived with. They lived together until she was killed by some gang members. Filho escaped. In search of revenge for her death, he murdered and tortured several people in an attempt to find out the identity of the gangster who killed Olympia.
Before he was 18 years old he had already left a trail of 10 bodies and several injured.

Still in Mogi das Cruzes, he executed his own father at a local prison, after his father butchered his mother with a [[machete]]. To get revenge, Filho killed his father, cut out a piece of his heart, chewed it, and threw it away.

Filho was first arrested on May 24, 1973. He was sentenced to prison and killed at least 4 inmates while incarcerated. He later claimed a total of 100 victims. His total confirmed victims are 71, including his father. In 2003, he was sentenced to 128 years in prison, although Brazilian law system prohibits anyone from spending more than 30 years behind bars. But due to the crimes he committed inside the prison, his sentence was changed to over 400 years in prison. However, he was set to be released by the Justice System in 2007, and after 34 years in prison, he was released on April 24, 2007. Information from the Brazilian National Security Force Intel indicates that he went to Brazilian north-east, more precisely, to [[Fortaleza]] in Ceará.
On September 15, 2011, local media from Santa Catarina published that Filho had been arrested at his home, in the rural area, where he worked as a house-keeper, at Balneário Camboriú, Santa Catarina coastline. According to a news channel, he will serve time for accusations such as riot and false imprisonment.

Besides the number of killings, Filho became notorious in Brazil for promising the murder of other criminals, such as [[Francisco de Assis Pereira]], a.k.a. The Park Maniac, another [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.reclamando.com.br/%3Faction%3Dread%26eid%3D295%26id%3D879%26system%3Dnews&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Pedrinho%2BMatador%2522%26start%3D50%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1T4ADBF_enCA238CA238%26sa%3DN &quot;What the science has discovered about the coldest of criminals – the psychopath&quot;] (translated from Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atalay Filiz''' is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[serial killer]] suspect. He is held responsible for at least three murders, possibly for one in 2012, two in September 2013 and one in May 2016. A fugitive for more than two years, he was captured in June 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
Atalay Filiz was born to an officer of the [[Turkish Air Force]]. His father retired from the military, and entered a career as a pilot at the [[Turkish Airlines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

He was educated at [[Galatasaray High School]] , one of the most prominent high schools of Turkey, in [[Istanbul]], and graduated with honors. His teachers remark that &quot;he is so intelligent that he could survive in a jungle when left alone.&quot; In college, Filiz studied biology in the [[University of Paris-Sud]] in [[France]]. In 2010, he came back Turkey and said his family he will study for his doctorate in Ankara. However, after the allegations it is revealed that he was never registered for a doctorate degree in Ankara &lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;

==Murders==
He is accused of murdering in 2013 two people, whom he knew from his time in [[Paris]], France. On September 16, Filiz allegedly ambushed and killed Göktuğ Demirarslan, the 24-year-old son of [[Air vice-marshal]] Hasan Hüseyin Demirarslan, and his 23-year old Russian girlfriend Elena Radchikova ({{lang-ru|Елена Радчикова}}) with a [[pump action shotgun]] in front of the entrance of their housing estate in [[Eryaman, Etimesgut]] after secretly pursuing them two weeks long.&lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He is to said to have escaped, and was ascertained that he flew to Greece with a fake identity. To another police information, he went to Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt; To seek his location and to arrest him, an Interpol red notice was issued. It was believed that he later returned to Turkey with his fake identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

On May 27, 2016, he allegedly murdered the 40-year old Fatma Kayıkçı, a history teacher and mother of two,&lt;ref name=&quot;h2&quot;/&gt; the spouse of his boss Gani Kayıkçı.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He was staying under the alias Furkan Altın in the ground floor flat of the apartment building, where also the family Kayıkçı lived. She was about to leave the building to pickup her child from the school. Filiz allegedly stabbed her, put her body in a wheeled luggage in his flat, took it outside, as seen on a [[closed-circuit television|surveillance footage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He dumped her body at the bottom of a tree in an open terrain nearby. The neighbors in the apartment building heard screams. One of her shoes and bloodstains led to Filiz' flat.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt; Police identified Furkan Altın as Atalay Filiz from the fingerprints in the crime scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;  The victim's body was found the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;

It is now believed that he also murdered in Paris his Russian girlfriend Olga Seregina ({{lang-ru|Ольга Серегина}}), who had introduced her friend Radchikova to Demirarslan during their stay in Paris. She had mysteriously vanished in 2011. An [[Interpol notice]] in the form of a yellow notice was issued at that time to locate the missing woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

Filiz was captured and arrested by police in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016 upon information of a citizen in [[Menderes, İzmir]], western Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==

===Birth and childhood===
Fish was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on May 19, 1870, to Randall (1795&amp;nbsp;– October 16, 1875) and Ellen (née Howell; 1838–c. 1903&lt;ref&gt;Sing Sing Prison's receiving blotter indicates Fish was 33 when his mother died. Available on Ancestry.com under Albert H. Fish.&lt;/ref&gt;) Fish. His father was American, of English ancestry, and his mother was [[Scots-Irish American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/fish.html |title=Ancestry of Albert Fish |website=wargs.com |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner|date= |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was 43 years older than his mother&lt;ref name=1870census&gt;
Media:1870 census Fish.jpg|Albert Fish in the [[1870 US Census]] for [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and 75 years old at the time of his birth. Fish was the youngest child and had three living siblings: Walter, Annie, and Edwin. He wished to be known as &quot;Albert&quot; [[Necronym|after a dead sibling]] and to escape the nickname &quot;Ham &amp; Eggs&quot; that he was given at an [[orphanage]] in which he spent much of his childhood.

Fish's family had a history of [[mental illness]]. His uncle suffered from [[mania]]. A brother was confined in a state [[mental hospital]]. His sister was diagnosed with a &quot;mental affliction&quot;. Three other relatives were diagnosed with mental illnesses, and his mother had &quot;aural and/or visual hallucinations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schechter |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Schechter | year = 1990 | title =Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtZBOBe5_dAC | isbn = 0-671-67875-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/fish/index.html |title=Albert Fish |accessdate=2008-12-16 |publisher=[[Crime Library]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216143933/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/fish/index.html| archivedate= 16 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was a river boat captain and, by 1870, was a fertilizer manufacturer.&lt;ref name=1870census/&gt; The elder Fish died in 1875 at the Sixth Street Station of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The [[Congressional Cemetery]] records show that Randall died on October 16, 1875, and was buried on October 19, 1875, in grave R96/89. Fish's mother then put her son into Saint John's Orphanage in Washington, where he was frequently abused. He began to [[Sadomasochism|enjoy the physical pain]] that the beatings brought.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Colin |authorlink1=Colin Wilson |last2=Seaman |first2=Donald |title=The Serial Killers |year=2004 |publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojygGQAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=978-0-7535-1321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his time at the orphanage, Fish remarked, &quot;I was there 'til I was nearly nine, and that's where I got started wrong. We were unmercifully whipped. I saw boys doing many things they should not have done.&quot;

By 1880, his mother had a government job and was able to remove Fish from the orphanage. In 1882, at age 12, he began a relationship with a telegraph boy. The youth introduced Fish to such practices as [[urolagnia]] (drinking urine) and [[coprophagia]] (eating feces). Fish began visiting public baths where he could watch other boys undress and spent a great portion of his weekends on these visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot; /&gt; Throughout his life, he would write obscene letters to women whose names he acquired from [[classified advertising]] and [[Dating agency|matrimonial agencies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;

===1890–1918: Early adulthood and criminal history===
By 1890, Fish arrived in [[New York City]], and he said at that point he became a [[prostitute]] and began [[rape|raping]] young boys. In 1898, his mother arranged a marriage for him with a woman nine years his junior.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berry-dee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry-Dee|first1=Christopher|title=Cannibal Serial Killers: Profiles of Depraved Flesh-eating Murderers|date=2011|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=1569759022|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had six children: Albert, Anna, Gertrude, Eugene, John, and Henry Fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;/&gt;

Throughout 1898, he worked as a house painter. He said he continued molesting children, mostly boys younger than age six. He later recounted an incident in which a male lover took him to a waxworks museum, where Fish was fascinated by a [[bisection]] of a [[penis]]. After that, he became obsessed with sexual mutilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;berry-dee&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=capo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capo|first1=Fran|title=Myths and Mysteries of New York|date=2011|publisher=Morris Book Publishing, LLC|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=978-0-7627-6107-4|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903, he was arrested for [[grand larceny]] and was sentenced to incarceration in [[Sing Sing]].
[[File:Pelvis of Albert Fish (X-ray).jpg|thumb|left|150px|X-ray of Fish's [[pelvis]] and [[perineum]], introduced as evidence at his trial, demonstrating more than two dozen [[self-embedding|self-embedded]] needles]]
Around 1910, while he was working in Wilmington, Delaware, Fish met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Kedden. He took Kedden to where he was staying, and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not Fish forced Kedden to do these things, but in his confession he implies that the man was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Kedden to &quot;an old farm house&quot;, where he began to torture him. The torture took place over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Kedden up and cut off half of his penis. &quot;I shall never forget his scream, or the look he gave me,&quot; Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Kedden, cut up his body, and take it home, but he feared the hot weather would draw attention to him; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a [[Vaseline]]-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Kedden goodbye, and left. &quot;Took first train I could get back home. Never heard what become of him, or tried to find out,&quot; Fish said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borowski|first1=John|title=Albert Fish: In His Own Words|date=September 5, 2014|publisher=Waterfront Productions|isbn=0692263756|page=314|url=http://www.amazon.com/Albert-Fish-His-Own-Words/dp/0692263756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1917, Fish's wife left him for John Straube, a handyman who boarded with the Fish family. Fish then had to raise his children as a [[single parent]]. After his arrest, Fish told a newspaper that when his wife left him, she took nearly every possession the family owned.&lt;ref name=&quot;prairieghosts.com&quot;&gt;Taylor, Troy.

Retrieved February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to have [[auditory hallucinations]]. He once wrapped himself in a [[carpet]], saying that he was following the instructions of [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot; /&gt;

It was about this time that Fish began to indulge in [[self-harm]]. He would [[self-embedding|embed]] needles into his groin and abdomen.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt; After his arrest, [[X-rays]] revealed that Fish had at least 29 needles lodged in his [[human pelvis|pelvic]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt; He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight.&lt;ref name=&quot;prairieghosts.com&quot;/&gt; While he was never thought to have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends to paddle his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself. He soon developed a growing obsession with [[cannibalism]], often preparing himself a dinner consisting solely of raw meat and sometimes serving it to his children.

===1919–1930: Escalation===
In about 1919, he stabbed an intellectually disabled boy in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT03261935&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fish is Sentenced.

On July 11, 1924, Fish found eight-year-old Beatrice Kiel playing alone on her parents' [[Staten Island]] farm. He offered her money to come and help him look for [[rhubarb]]. She was about to leave the farm when her mother chased Fish away. Fish left but returned later to the Kiels' barn, where he tried to sleep but was discovered by Hans Kiel and forced to leave. During 1924, the 54-year-old Fish, suffering from [[psychosis]], felt that [[God]] was commanding him to [[torture]] and sexually mutilate children.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;

Shortly before his abduction of Grace Budd, Fish attempted to test his &quot;implements of Hell&quot; on a child he had been molesting named Cyril Quinn. Quinn and his friend were playing [[Four square|box ball]] on a sidewalk when Fish asked them if they had eaten lunch. When they said that they had not, he invited them into his apartment for sandwiches. While the two boys were wrestling on Fish's bed, they dislodged his mattress; underneath was a knife, a small handsaw, and a meat cleaver. They became frightened and ran out of the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borowski|first1=John|title=Albert Fish: In His Own Words|date=September 5, 2014|publisher=Waterfront Productions|isbn=0692263756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Grace Budd===
[[File:Grace budd.gif|thumb|right|150px|Grace Budd (1918–1928)]]
On May 25, 1928, Fish saw a classified advertisement in the Sunday edition of the ''[[New York World]]'' that read, &quot;Young man, 18, wishes position in country. Edward Budd, 406 West 15th Street.&quot; On May 28, 1928, Fish, then 58&amp;nbsp;years old, visited the Budd family in [[Manhattan]] under the pretense of hiring Edward; he later confessed that he planned to tie Edward up, mutilate him, and leave him to bleed to death. He introduced himself as Frank Howard, a farmer from [[Farmingdale, New York]]. Fish promised to hire Budd and his friend Willie, and said he would send for them in a few days. He failed to show up, but he sent a telegraph to the Budd family apologizing and set a later date. When Fish returned, he met Grace Budd. He apparently changed his intended victim from Edward Budd to Grace Budd and quickly made up a story about having to attend his niece's birthday party. He convinced the parents, Delia Flanagan and Albert Budd I, to let Grace accompany him to the party that evening. The elder Albert Budd was a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] for the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|United States Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. Grace had a younger sister, Beatrice, two older brothers, Edward and George Budd, and a younger brother, Albert Budd II. Grace left with Fish that day but never returned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:1920 census Budd.jpg|Grace Budd]] in the [[1920 US Census]] for [[Manhattan]]{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Letter to the mother of Grace Budd====
In November 1934, an anonymous letter was sent to the girl's parents which ultimately led the police to Fish. Mrs. Budd was illiterate and could not read the letter herself, so she had her son read it to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schechter |first1=Harold |authorlink1=Harold Schechter |last2=Everitt |first2=David |title=The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers |year=2006 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |page=163 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HvZYXHdnBQC |isbn=978-1-4165-2174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unaltered letter (complete with Fish's misspellings and grammatical errors) reads:&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;!-- Please don't correct his original spelling and grammar errors, this is quoted as is stated--&gt;
{{quote|&quot;My dear Mrs Budd,

In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the steamer Tacoma, Capt John Davis. They sailed from San Francisco to Hong Kong China. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was a famine in China.
Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop
and ask for steak – chops – or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them – tortured them – to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head – bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear – right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 – 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese – strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick – bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9 days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her, though, I could of had I wished. She died a virgin.&quot;}}&lt;!-- Please don't correct his original spelling errors--&gt;

Police investigated the letter. The story concerning &quot;Capt. Davis&quot; and the &quot;famine&quot; in Hong Kong could not be verified. The part of the letter concerning the murder of Grace Budd, however, was found to be accurate in its description of the kidnapping and subsequent events, although it was impossible to confirm whether or not Fish had actually eaten parts of Grace's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;schechter&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Schechter | first = Harold | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer! | publisher = Gallery Books | date = 1998 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heimer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Heimer | first = Mel | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cannibal; The Case Of Albert Fish | publisher = Lyle Stuart | date = 1971 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;martingale&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Martingale | first = Moira | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cannibal Killers: The Impossible Monsters | publisher = Robert Hale Ltd | date = 1993 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capture====
The letter was delivered in an envelope that had a small [[hexagon]]al emblem with the letters &quot;N.Y.P.C.B.A.&quot; representing &quot;New York Private Chauffeur's Benevolent Association&quot;. A janitor at the company told the police he had taken some of the stationery home but left it at his rooming house at 200 East [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] when he moved out. The landlady of the rooming house said that Fish checked out of that room a few days earlier. She said that Fish's son sent him money and he asked her to hold his next check for him. William F. King was the chief investigator for the case. He waited outside the room until Fish returned. Fish agreed to go to headquarters for questioning, then brandished a razor blade. King disarmed Fish and took him to police headquarters. Fish made no attempt to deny the murder of Grace Budd, saying that he meant to go to the house to kill Edward Budd, Grace's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Fish supplied the following biographical information in captivity: &quot;I was born May 19, 1870, in [[Washington, D.C.]]. We lived on B Street, N.E., between Second and Third. My father was Captain Randall Fish, 32nd-degree [[Freemasonry|Mason]], and he is buried in the Grand Lodge grounds of the [[Congressional Cemetery]]. He was a [[Potomac River]] boat captain, running from D.C. to [[Marshall Hall, Maryland|Marshall Hall]], [[Virginia]] {{sic}}. My father dropped dead October 15, 1875, in the old [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Station]] where [[James A. Garfield|President Garfield]] was shot, and I was placed in St. John's Orphanage in Washington. I was there till I was nearly nine, and that's where I got started wrong. We were unmercifully whipped. I saw boys doing many things they should not have done. I sang in the choir from 1880 to 1884, [[soprano]], at St. John's. I came to New York. I was a good painter, interiors or anything. I got an apartment and brought my mother up from Washington. We lived at 76 West 101st Street, and that's where I met my wife. After our six children were born, she left me. She took all the furniture and didn't even leave a mattress for the children to sleep on. I'm still worried about my children, you'd think they'd come to visit their old dad in jail, but they haven't.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fish said it &quot;never even entered [his] head&quot; to [[rape]] the girl,&lt;ref name=&quot;SerialKillers&quot;&gt;Wilson, Colin and Donald Seaman. ''The Serial Killers''. Virgin Publishing Ltd. 2004. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; but he later claimed to his attorney that, while kneeling on Grace's chest and strangling her, he did have two involuntary ejaculations. This information was used at trial to make the claim the kidnapping was sexually motivated, thus avoiding any mention of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Colin and Donald Seaman. ''The Serial Killers''. Virgin Publishing Ltd. 2004, page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes discovered after Fish's arrest==

===Francis McDonnell===
During the night of July 14, 1924, 9-year-old Francis McDonnell was reported missing by his parents. He failed to return home after playing catch with friends in the [[Port Richmond, Staten Island|Port Richmond]] neighborhood of [[Staten Island]]. A search was organized and his body was found—hanging by a tree—in a wooded area near his home. He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left [[hamstring]] had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated that he intended to castrate the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area.

McDonnell's friends told the police that he was taken by an elderly man with a gray mustache. A neighbor also told the police he observed the boy with a similar-looking man walking along a grassy path into the nearby woods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; Francis' mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day. She told the reporters, &quot;He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw his thick gray hair and his drooping gray mustache. Everything about him seemed faded and gray.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt;

This description resulted in the mysterious stranger becoming known as &quot;The Gray Man&quot;. The McDonnell murder remained unsolved until the murder of Grace Budd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; When several eyewitnesses, among them the Staten Island farmer Hans Kiel, positively identified Albert Fish as the odd stranger seen around Port Richmond on the day of Francis McDonnell's disappearance, [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas J. Walsh (New York)|Thomas J. Walsh]] announced his intention to seek an indictment against Fish for the boy's murder. At first Fish denied the charges. It was only in March 1935, after the conclusion of his trial for the Budd murder and his confession to the killing of Billy Gaffney, that Fish confirmed to investigators that he also raped and murdered Francis McDonnell. When the McDonnell confession was made public, the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the disclosure solidified Fish's reputation as &quot;the most vicious child-slayer in criminal history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt;

===Billy Gaffney===
On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in [[Brooklyn]] with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said &quot;the [[bogeyman]] took him.&quot; Gaffney's body was never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Gaffney's parents were Edward and Elizabeth Gaffney.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, serial killer [[Peter Kudzinowski]] was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a [[Brooklyn]] [[tram|trolley]], saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the &quot;bogeyman&quot; matched Fish's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Charley Project'' page on [http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html Billy Gaffney]. Retrieved January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Police matched the description of the child to Billy Gaffney. Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927 and that on the day of Billy Gaffney's disappearance he was working at a location a few miles away from where the boy was abducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring03/Rawlins/fishvict.htm &quot; Albert Fish.&quot;] ''The Life of a Cannibal''. Retrieved February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Fish claimed the following in a letter to his attorney:&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|I brought him to the Riker Ave. dumps. There is a ''house'' that stands alone, not far from where I took him ... I took the G boy there. Stripped him naked and tied his hands and feet and gagged him with a piece of dirty rag I picked out of the dump. Then I burned his clothes. Threw his shoes in the dump. Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy [[cat o' nine tails|cat-of-nine tails]]. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears&amp;nbsp;– nose&amp;nbsp;– [[Glasgow smile|slit his mouth from ear to ear]]. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head&amp;nbsp;– feet&amp;nbsp;– arms&amp;nbsp;– hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep. They sank at once. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears&amp;nbsp;– nose&amp;nbsp;– pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.}}

Elizabeth Gaffney visited Fish in Sing Sing, accompanied by Detective King and two other men. She wanted to ask him about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.

==Trial and execution==
Albert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[cunnilingus]], [[anilingus]], [[fellatio]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a &quot;psychiatric phenomenon&quot; and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;

The defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly &quot;sacrificing&quot; a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered &quot;He is insane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an &quot;insane knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

The first of four rebuttal witnesses was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue psychiatric hospital]], where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not &quot;mentally sick&quot; and that these were common perversions that were &quot;socially perfectly alright&quot; and that Fish was &quot;no different from millions of other people&quot;, some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the &quot;very same&quot; perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, &quot;That is not masochism&quot;, as he was only &quot;punishing himself to get sexual gratification&quot;. The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but &quot;was a matter of taste&quot; and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--{{quotation|&quot;He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on. He put those on and came out into the front room, and he got down on his hands and knees, and he had a paint stick that he stirred paint with. ... He would give the stick to one of us, and then he would get down on his hands and knees and we would sit on his back, one at a time, with our back facing him, and then we would put up so many fingers, and he was to tell how many fingers we had up, and if he guessed right, which he never did, why, we weren't supposed to hit him. Sometimes, he would even say more fingers than we really had. And if he never guessed right, why, we would hit him as many fingers as we would have up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;}}--&gt;

None of the jurors doubted that Fish was insane, but ultimately, as one later explained, they felt he should be executed anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Gini Graham|title=American Murder: Volume 1: Homicide in the Early 20th Century|date=2007|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-999-77-3|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63Et0WJR_ooC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found him to be [[Sanity|sane]] and guilty, and the judge ordered the [[death sentence]]. Fish arrived at prison in March 1935, and was executed on January 16, 1936, in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing]]. He entered the chamber at 11:06&amp;nbsp;p.m. and was pronounced dead three minutes later.&lt;ref name=&quot;pay&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Albert Fish, 65, Pays Penalty at Sing Sing |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20717F93C58107A93C5A8178AD85F428385F9 |quote=Albert Fish, 65&amp;nbsp;years old, of 55 East 128th Street, Manhattan, a house painter who murdered Grace Budd, 6, after attacking her in a Westchester farmhouse in 1928, was put to death tonight in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 17, 1936 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the Sing Sing Prison Cemetery. Fish is said to have helped the executioner position the electrodes on his body. His last words were reportedly, &quot;I don't even know why I'm here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt; According to one witness present, it took two jolts before Fish died, creating the rumor that the apparatus was short-circuited by the needles that Fish inserted into his body.&lt;ref name=&quot;SerialKillers&quot; /&gt; These rumors were later regarded as untrue, as Fish reportedly died in the same fashion and time frame as others in the electric chair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt;

At a meeting with reporters after the execution, Fish's lawyer James Dempsey revealed that he was in possession of his client's &quot;final statement&quot;. This amounted to several pages of hand-written notes that Fish apparently penned in the hours just prior to his death. When pressed by the assembled journalists to reveal the document's contents, Dempsey refused, stating, &quot;I will never show it to anyone. It was the most filthy string of obscenities that I have ever read.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt;

'''Stephen Joseph &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi''' (born  June 9, 1934) is an American [[gangster]] and close associate of [[Winter Hill Gang]] boss [[Whitey Bulger]]. Beginning in 1975, Flemmi was a top echelon informant for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Despite delivering a great deal of intelligence about the inner workings of the [[Patriarca crime family]], Flemmi's own criminal activities proved a public relations nightmare for the FBI. For this reason, he was prosecuted under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) and sentenced to a long term of incarceration.

==Early years==
Stephen Joseph Flemmi was the eldest of three sons born to [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrant Giovanni and Irish immigrant Mary Irene Flemmi. He was raised in the Orchard Park tenement located at 25 Ambrose Street in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]]. His father was a bricklayer and veteran of the [[Royal Italian Army]] during [[World War I]], and his mother was a full-time homemaker.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Flemmi enlisted in the Army in 1951 at the age of 17 and served two tours of duty in Korea with the [[187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hassett|first=George|url=http://www.crimemagazine.com/fbi-boston-hoover-lies-and-murder|title=The FBI in Boston: Hoover, Lies and Murder |publisher=''Crime Magazine''|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Silver Star]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] medals for valor.&lt;ref name=Marino&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectmarino.com/boston-underworld-timeline/winter-hill-enterpris/stephen-the-rifleman-flemmi/|title=Stephen &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi|work=Project Marino|archive-url=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20150629234940/http://projectmarino.com/boston-underworld-timeline/winter-hill-enterpris/stephen-the-rifleman-flemmi/ |archive-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with James J. Bulger==
[[File:FBI surveillance photograph of James J. Bulger (r.) and Stephen Flemmi (l.).jpg|thumb|FBI surveillance photograph of Flemmi (left) with Winter Hill Gang boss, [[James Joseph Bulger|James Bulger]] (right), probably in the 1980s]]

In 1967, [[James J. &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger]] was released from Federal prison after serving a nine-year sentence for robbing banks. After a few years of working as a janitor, he became an enforcer for South Boston mob boss [[Donald Killeen]]. After Killeen was murdered by an enforcer for the [[Mullen Gang]], Winter Hill Gang boss [[Howie Winter]] mediated the dispute between Bulger and the remaining Killeens and the Mullens, who were led by [[Patrick Nee]]. Winter soon chose Bulger as his man in South Boston. Shortly afterward, Bulger became partners with Flemmi.

At this time, the Boston FBI office tried to convince Bulger to become an informant, but he refused.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/26/businessman-says-bulger-stuck-shotgun-in-his-mouth/|title=Witness in Bulger case says reputed mob boss stuck shotgun in his mouth|work=Fox News|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulger allegedly told Flemmi that he knew his secret. Flemmi has insisted that he did not know at the time that Bulger was also an informant. [[Kevin Weeks]], however, insists that Flemmi's story is untrue. He considers it too much of a coincidence that Bulger became an informant a year after becoming Flemmi's partner. He has written off his belief that Flemmi had probably helped to build a Federal case against him. Weeks has said that Bulger was likely forced to choose between supplying information to the FBI or returning to prison.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt;

==Married life==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DeborahHussey.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's stepdaughter]] --&gt;
In the 1950s, Flemmi was married to an Irish-American woman named Jeanette, from whom he later became estranged. By 1980, he planned to divorce Jeanette to marry his longtime mistress, Marilyn DeSilva, but it is unknown whether he ever followed through with the legal actions. Throughout his life, Flemmi was engaged in clandestine affairs with several other women, including sisters Debra Davis and Michelle Davis, and Deborah Hussey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/11/whitey-bulger-s-women-inside-the-terror-and-glamor-of-his-ex-girlfriends.html|title=Whitey Bulger's Women: Inside the Terror and Glamor of His Ex-Girlfriends|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flemmi met Debra Davis at a jewelry store, and the couple dated for more than seven years. In 1981, Bulger is said to have killed Davis because she knew that Flemmi was an informant.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/justice/massachusetts-bulger-trial/?hpt=hp_t3|title=Bulger pal on his cooperation with U.S.:  'I was dead either way' - CNN.com|author=Deborah Feyerick, CNN|date=25 July 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that Flemmi, Bulger, and Weeks lured her to the house at 799 East Third Street in South Boston and [[garrot]]ted her. Her body was then buried in the basement. According to [[Kevin Weeks]], {{quote|Stevie said he'd take care of the clothes and the teeth. He was all business, going about the task of removing cleaning up and pulling teeth. Even though he had a long term relationship with Debbie, this wasn't bothering him any more than it had bothered Jimmy. Stevie was actually enjoying it, the way he always enjoyed a good murder. Like a stockbroker going to work, he was just doing his job. Cold and relaxed, with no emotion or change in demeanor, he was performing a night's work. Whether he went out to meet one of his girlfriends or home to Marion, I have no idea. Later on, when I was alone with Jimmy, I asked him what this was all about. &quot;Who knows?&quot; he answered. &quot;She was bringing Blacks back to the house. She was doing drugs. Stevie was probably fucking her.&quot; I never asked again, but it was just kind of distasteful killing a woman. I can see killing guys. That's the life they chose, the life they're involved in, the life we all chose. But a woman was different. It wasn't a nice thing. Years later, it came out that Stevie was in fact having sex with Debbie. And she'd been his stepdaughter since she was three years old. Who knows if she knew anything else about him? But to kill a woman because she threatened to tell that you were fucking her didn't make any sense, no more than it did to kill a girlfriend because she wanted to leave you. According to Stevie testimony in a later trial, when it came out that he had been having sex with her daughter, Marion tossed his clothes out in the driveway and changed the locks to the house. She didn't know about the murder, but she knew about the sex. That didn't make any sense either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Brutal; My Life in Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob |first=Kevin |last=Weeks |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122–123}} }}

==Relationship with the FBI==
Rico first recruited Flemmi as an informant in 1965.

In 1997, shortly after ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' disclosed that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, former Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks met with Connolly, who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, &quot;The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|247}} According to Weeks, {{quote|As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of the information in the files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see that a lot of the reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|248}} }}

==Arrest and imprisonment==
In December 1994, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that several imprisoned Jewish-American bookmakers had agreed to testify to paying them [[protection money]]. As a result, sealed indictments had come from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the FBI was due to make arrests during the Christmas season. In response, Bulger fled Boston on December 23, 1994, accompanied by his [[common law wife]], Catherine Greig.

According to Kevin Weeks, {{quote|In 1993 and 1994, before the pinches came down, Jimmy and Stevie were traveling on the French and Italian Riviera. The two of them traveled all over Europe, sometimes separating for a while. Sometimes they took girls, sometimes just the two of them went. They would rent cars and travel all through Europe. It was more preparation than anything, getting ready for another life. They didn't ask me to go, not that I would have wanted to. Jimmy had prepared for the run for years. He'd established a whole other person, Thomas Baxter, with a complete ID and credit cards in that name. He'd even joined associations in Baxter's name, building an entire portfolio for the guy. He'd always said you had to be ready to take off on short notice. And he was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|215}} }}  Flemmi, however, chose to remain in Boston and was swiftly taken into custody and incarcerated at the [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]] House of Correction.

During the discovery phase, two of Flemmi's co-defendants, Boston mafiosi [[Frank Salemme]] and Bobby DeLuca, were listening to tape from a roving bug, which is normally authorized when the FBI has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place.  They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention that they should have told one of their informants to give &quot;a list of questions&quot; to the other wiseguys.  When their lawyer, Tony Cardinale, learned about this, he realized that the FBI had lied about the basis for a roving bug in order to protect an informant.  Suspecting that this was not the only occasion that this happened, Cardinale sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehr |first1=Dick |last2=O'Neill |first2=Gerard |title=Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the FBI, and a Devil's Deal |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |date=2000 |isbn=1-891620-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288-289, 291-293}}

Eventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were revealed to be FBI informants.  Flemmi believed that as a result, he had protection from the FBI, but not immunity.  He initially planned to prove through his own testimony and that of others that he was being prosecuted for crimes that were effectively authorized by the FBI.  He believed that as a result, Judge [[Mark L. Wolf]] would have no choice but to throw out the entire indictment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|297-300}} Stephen's problem was that he  couldn't really come clean. Without immunity, he couldn't admit to killings he hadn't been charged  with. By the time Stephen took the stand, in August 1998, John Martorano had pleaded guilty and started outlining the details of almost twenty murders he'd committed. Many of his murders had been done at the direction of Bulger and Stephen, who had paid him more than $1 million during his years as a wanted fugitive between 1978 and 1995. To many questions about the murders Flemmi was involved in, he pleaded the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|313-316}}

However, by 2000, it was obvious this gambit had failed.  Out of desperation, he ordered Weeks to get in touch with retired state police lieutenant [[Richard J. Schneiderhan]], a lifelong friend who had been on Winter Hill's payroll for virtually his entire career, to leak information about several wiretaps investigators were monitoring in hopes of tracking down Bulger.  However, when Weeks reached a plea bargain a year later, he admitted Schneiderhan's role in the leak.  Schneiderhan was ultimately convicted of obstructing justice and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  In 2000, Flemmi's brother Michael, then a retired Boston Police officer, was arrested for moving an arsenal of more than 70 weapons from their mother's shed after learning that it was to be the target of a search warrant.  He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.  A year later, he pleaded guilty to selling a load of Stephen's stolen jewelry for $40,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|340-341}}

By 2003, Flemmi knew he was at the end of his tether.  Salemme, Weeks and several others had turned informer, and had disclosed enough information to send Flemmi to prison for life, and possibly send him to death.  In October, Flemmi pleaded guilty in [[U.S. District Court]] in Boston to 10 counts of murder.   He made the decision as a part of a deal to reduce the sentence for his brother, Michael Flemmi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|341-342}}

==In popular culture==
Flemmi is portrayed by [[Rory Cochrane]] in the 2015 Whitey Bulger biopic ''[[Black Mass (film)|Black Mass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/09/23/black_mass_accuracy_what_s_fact_and_what_s_fiction_in_the_james_whitey_bulger.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Flemmi loosely inspired the character Mr. French, portrayed by [[Ray Winstone]], in the film ''[[The Departed]]''

'''Michel Fourniret''' (born 4 April 1942) is a convicted French [[serial killer]] who confessed in June and July 2004 to [[kidnapping]], [[rape|raping]] and murdering nine girls in a span of 14 years, from 1987 to 2001. He was also accused of 10 additional murders, nine in France and one in Belgium, and was found guilty of seven of these charges. The trials started on 27 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7311104.stm|title=French 'serial killer' on trial |publisher=BBC|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on 28 May. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ogre/Beast of the Ardennes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7423554.stm|publisher= BBC | date=28 May 2008 | title=The couple who 'hunted virgins'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourniret was arrested after a failed attempt to kidnap a Belgian girl in June 2003. His wife, Monique Olivier, exposed him after hearing the news of another child murderer's wife (Michelle Martin, wife of [[Marc Dutroux]]) being convicted.  Fourniret was charged with the [[child abduction|abduction]] of minors and [[sexual misconduct]], and has been in detention since June 2003 for the attempted [[kidnapping]] of a 14-year-old girl in 2000. Olivier was charged with one murder and for helping him with a further six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Campbell|date=23 March 2008|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=yes|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3602716.ece |title=Wife lured virgins for ‘Ogre of the Ardennes’ serial killer | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourniret buried at least two of his victims at his Sautou chateau near [[Donchery]] in the French Ardennes in the late 1980s. On 3 July 2004, a team of French and Belgian police recovered the bodies of two of Fourniret's victims near the chateau. Fourniret was sentenced to life in prison; Olivier was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 28 years.&lt;ref name=BBCsentence/&gt;

== Confessed murders ==
* '''Isabelle Laville''' –  a 17-year-old French girl. She disappeared in [[Auxerre]], on 11 December 1987 on her way home from school. Her skeletal remains were located at the bottom of a well in the country north of Auxerre in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closed Cases|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/located.html |publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate= 1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Farida Hellegouarch''' – the girlfriend of one of the members of the [[Gang des postiches]] (a gang of bank robbers), a former cellmate of Fourniret's. Fourniret killed her in 1988 to access the group's funds. He bought his castle in France with the money.
* '''Fabienne Leroy''' – a 20-year-old woman. She disappeared in 1988 in [[Châlons-en-Champagne]], and her body was later found in the nearby woods. Killed by a shot to the heart after attempts to inject air into her veins.
* '''Jeanne-Marie Desramault''' –  a 22-year-old French student. She disappeared in 1989 from the railway station of [[Charleville-Mézières]], and her body was recovered from the estate of Fourniret with his assistance.
* '''[[Elisabeth Brichet case|Elisabeth Brichet]]''' – a 12-year-old Belgian girl. She disappeared from [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in 1989 after playing with a friend. Her disappearance was long thought to be at the hands of [[Marc Dutroux]], until Fourniret led police to her burial site on his estate in France.
* '''Natacha Danais''' – a 13-year-old French girl, disappeared November 1990 in Nantes, western France whilst out shopping with her mother. Her body was found a few days later on a local beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 February 2005|publisher=BBC|title=French child killing case widens|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4226283.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Céline Saison''' – 18-year-old who disappeared in 2000 in [[Charleville-Mézières]]. Her body was found in Belgium.
* '''Mananya Thumpong''' – 13-year-old who disappeared in 2001 from [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]]. Her body was also later found in Belgium.

== Other crimes ==

He was named as a suspect in connection with the murder of 20-year-old [[England|Englishwoman]] [[Murder of Joanna Parrish|Joanna Parrish]], whose body was found in an [[Auxerre]] river on 17 May 1990. She had been raped and strangled. However, he has never been charged with her murder and 25 years on the murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8686507.stm | work=BBC News | title=Daughter murder 'may be unsolved' | date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobby Jack Fowler''' (June 12, 1939&amp;nbsp;– May 15, 2006) was an American rapist and alleged [[serial killer]] active in the United States and Canada. He died in prison of [[lung cancer]] during a 16-year sentence following a conviction for [[rape]], [[kidnapping]] and attempted rape in [[Newport, Oregon]], in 1996 (for an attack that took place in 1995).

Fowler was a transient construction worker who is known to have traveled extensively across North America. He spent time &quot;rabbiting around&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[&quot;We think that was how he tried to protect himself, immediately rabbiting to another part of the country and establishing himself there,&quot; Lincoln County Detective Ron Benson, quoted in Lori tobias], &quot;Bobby Jack Fowler, suspect in death of Newport teen girls, may have killed 20 or more people&quot;, The Oregonian, October 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; North America to such places as British Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, Oregon, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington State.&lt;ref name=&quot;News.nationalpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/with-one-murder-solved-difficult-highway-of-tears-investigations-go-on/ |title=Bobby Jack Fowler: One murder solved as difficult ‘Highway of Tears’ investigations go on &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/10/bobby_jack_fowler_suspect_in_d.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Bobby Jack Fowler, suspect in death of Newport teen girls, may have killed 20 or more people | date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels he developed an extensive criminal record and is known to have committed several violent crimes.

He liked to travel far and wide in beat-up old cars, frequently picked up hitchhikers, and spent time in bars and motels. Fowler believed that women he came into contact with who were hitchhiking and hanging out in bars wanted to be sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Bobby+Jack+Fowler+linked+Highway+Tears+death+suspected+others/7298620/story.html |title=Bobby Jack Fowler: He was violent, charming and sometimes disarming |publisher=Thestarphoenix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler is a suspect in the Highway of Tears murders. His DNA was found on the body of Colleen MacMillen, one of the presumed victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Fowler is also strongly suspected to have killed both Gale Weys and Pamela Darlington in 1973.

===Other murders===
May 3, 1992 around 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Sheila Swanson, 19, and Melissa Sanders, 17, were last seen making a call from a payphone near the Beverly Beach State Park where they had been camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=((District Attorney, Lincoln County, Oregon)) |url=http://www.globalnews.ca/chronology+of+events+in+lincoln+county+oregon/6442721534/story.html |title=Global News &amp;#124; Chronology of events in Lincoln County, Oregon |publisher=Globalnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;discovery1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=in Unsolved |url=http://blogs.discovery.com/bizarre/2009/04/help-solve-the-murders-of-teenage-girls-in-oregon.html |title=Bizarre Crime of the Week: Investigation Discovery: Help Solve the Murders of Teenage Girls in Oregon |publisher=Blogs.discovery.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies were later discovered on October 10, 1992, by hunters in a wooded area near [[Eddyville, Oregon|Eddyville]], Oregon.

Their strangled bodies were later discovered on February 15, 1995, by loggers in a wooded area, covered up with brush.&lt;ref name=&quot;discovery1&quot;/&gt;

==Arrest and investigation==
On June 28, 1995, Fowler was arrested following an incident which involved a woman jumping out of a Tides Inn motel in Newport, Oregon motel window with a rope still tied to her ankle. She survived the attack and reported her harrowing tale to the local police.

On January 8, 1996, Fowler was convicted of Kidnapping in the 1st Degree, Attempted Rape in the 1st Degree, Sexual Abuse in the 1st Degree, Coercion, Assault in the Fourth Degree, and Menacing. He was sentenced to 195 months (16 years, 3 months) with the possibility of parole.

On 25 September 2012 the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Lincoln County District Attorney Rob Bovett named Bobby Jack Fowler as a suspect in three of the Highway of Tears murders. His DNA was found on the body of Colleen MacMillen, one of the presumed victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
In May 2006, Fowler died at the age of 66 in [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] from lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2012/09/25/0926-fowler-profile/ |title=Bobby Jack Fowler linked to one ‘Highway of Tears’ death and suspected in two others &amp;#124; canada.com |publisher=O.canada.com |date=1974-08-09 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Paul Franklin''' (born '''James Clayton Vaughn, Jr.'''; April 13, 1950 – November 20, 2013) was an American [[serial killer]] who gained notoriety for numerous murders in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His killing spree was the subject of a fictional novel entitled ''[[Hunter (Pierce novel)|Hunter]]'' by white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]]. Pierce said of Franklin that &quot;he saw his duty as a white man and did what a responsible son of his race must do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/murders-price|title=MURDER'S PRICE|first=Don|last=Perry|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of Terror: What We Can and Can't Know About Terrorism|first=Philip|last=Jenkins|isbn=0202306798|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was convicted of several murders, and received six [[life sentence]]s, as well as the [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher [[Larry Flynt]] in 1978 and [[Vernon Jordan|Vernon Jordan, Jr.]], the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases. Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid [[schizophrenic]] who was not fit to stand trial.

Franklin was on death row for 15 years awaiting execution in the state of Missouri for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;edition&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/19/justice/missouri-franklin-execution/| title=Judge stays serial killer's execution| publisher=CNN| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/11/20/joseph-paul-franklin-execution/3648881/| title=High court denies execution stay for racist serial killer| work=USA Today| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed by [[lethal injection]] on November 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217| title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed| publisher=BBC News| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Clayton Vaughn, Jr. was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] on April 13, 1950, as the eldest son of James Clayton Vaughn, Sr. and Helen Rau Vaughn, and brother to Carolyn, Marilyn and Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/423604/LIFE-OF-HATE-AND-KILLING-BEGAN-IN-50.html?pg=all|title=LIFE OF HATE AND KILLING BEGAN IN '50|publisher=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Clayton Vaughn, Sr. was an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[World War II]] veteran and butcher who left the family when Vaughn, Jr. was eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077938,00.html|title=On the Trail of a Murderous Sniper Suspect: the Tangled Life of Joseph Paul Franklin|publisher=[[People (magazine)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn's sister Carolyn recalled &quot;Whenever [Vaughn, Sr.] came to visit he'd beat us,&quot; and their mother had Vaughn, Sr. jailed twice for public drunkenness. Helen Rau Vaughn was described by a family friend as &quot;a full-blooded German, a real strict, perfectionist lady. I never saw her beat any of [her children], but they told me stories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt; Vaughn later stated that he was rarely given enough to eat and suffered severe [[child abuse|physical abuse]] as a child,&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Damaged|journal=The New Yorker|date=February 24, 1997|pages=132–47|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1997-02-24#folio=132|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his mother &quot;didn't care about [him and his siblings]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/18/justice/death-row-interview-joseph-paul-franklin/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 |title=Serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin prepares to die |publisher=CNN |date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that these factors stunted his emotional development, and said he had &quot;always been least 10 years or more behind other people in their maturity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

As early as high school, he had become interested first in [[evangelical Christianity]], then [[Nazism]], and later held memberships in both the [[National Socialist White People's Party]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and even changed his name to '''Joseph Paul Franklin''' in honor of [[Joseph Goebbels|Paul Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949029,00.html|title=Racist Rifleman| work= Time | date=November 10, 1980 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to try to start a [[race war]] after reading ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. &quot;I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,&quot; he would reflect later. &quot;It was something weird about that book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wwwbbccouknewsworlduscanada&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217|title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed|date=20 November 2013|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
For much of his life, Franklin was a drifter, roaming up and down the East Coast looking for chances to &quot;cleanse the world&quot; of people he considered inferior, especially [[African-American|blacks]] and [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;  His primary source of financial support appears to have come from bank robberies.  He supplemented his bank robbery income with paid [[blood bank]] donations, which eventually led to his subsequent capture by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/serial-killers-part-4/|title=FBI - Serial Killers, Part 4: Joseph Paul Franklin|date=7 March 2017|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977===

*On August 7, 1977, Franklin shot a young interracial couple, Alphonse Manning, Jr. and Toni Schwenn, in a parking lot at East Towne Mall in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].

*In fall 1977, in suburban [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Franklin hid in the bushes near a [[synagogue]] and fired on a group attending services.

===1978===
*Franklin claimed that, on March 6, 1978, he used a [[Ruger Model 44|Ruger .44 caliber semi-automatic rifle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayton2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mel Ayton|title=Dark Soul of the South: The Life and Crimes of Racist Killer Joseph Paul Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CO7wbCkKsYC&amp;pg=PA1745|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59797-574-2|pages=1745–}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ambush ''[[Hustler]]'' publisher [[Larry Flynt]] and his lawyer Gene Reeves in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]]. In his confession, Franklin said this was in retaliation for an edition of ''Hustler'' displaying interracial sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;
*On July 29, Franklin hid near a [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and shot and killed Bryant Tatum, a black man, with a 12-gauge shotgun; he also shot Tatum's white girlfriend, Nancy Hilton, who survived. Franklin confessed and pleaded guilty, being given a life sentence, as well as a sentence for an unrelated armed robbery in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

===1979===
*July 12, 1979: [[Taco Bell]] manager Harold McIver (27), a black man, was fatally shot through a window from {{convert|150|yd}} in [[Doraville, Georgia]]. Franklin confessed but was not tried or sentenced for this crime. Franklin said that McIver was in close contact with white women, so he murdered him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

===1980===
*May 29, 1980: Franklin said he shot and seriously wounded civil rights activist and Urban League president [[Vernon Jordan, Jr.]] after seeing him with a white woman in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. Franklin initially denied any part in the crime and was [[acquittal|acquitted]], but later confessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;
*June 8, 1980: Franklin confessed to killing cousins Darrell Lane (14) and Dante Evans Brown (13) in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].

*June 25, 1980: Franklin used a .44 Ruger pistol to kill two hitchhikers, Nancy Santomero (19) and Vicki Durian (26), in [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia]]. He confessed to the crime in 1997 to an Ohio assistant prosecutor in the course of investigation in another case; he said he picked up the white women and decided to kill them after one said she had a black boyfriend. Jacob Beard of Florida, was convicted and imprisoned in 1993 on these charges. He was freed in 1999 and a new trial was ordered based on Franklin's confession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horn&quot;&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/01/30/loc_franklins_confession.html Dan Horn, &quot;Franklin's confession frees man: Judge grants new trial in W.Va. slayings], ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', January 30, 1999.

==Apprehension, conviction, and imprisonment==
Following the two murders in Utah, Franklin returned to the midwestern US.  Traveling through [[Kentucky]], he was detained and questioned regarding a firearm that he was transporting in his car.  Franklin fled from this interrogation, but authorities recovered sufficient evidence from the vehicle to point suspicions that potentially linked him to the sniper killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;/&gt;

Franklin's multiple, distinctive, racist [[tattoo]]s, coupled with his habit of visiting blood banks, led investigators to issue a nationwide alert to blood banks.  In October, 1980, the tattoos drew the attention of a Florida blood bank worker, who contacted the FBI.  Franklin was arrested in Lakeland, Florida on October 28, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;/&gt;

Franklin tried to escape during the judgment of the 1997 Missouri trial on charges of murdering Gerald Gordon. He was convicted of the murder charge.  The psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis]], who had interviewed him at length, testified for the defense that she believed that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and unfit to stand trial.  She noted his delusional thinking and a childhood history of severe abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

In October 2013, Larry Flynt called for clemency for Franklin asserting &quot;that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24579849|title=Larry Flynt: Don't execute man who shot me|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=October 18, 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was held on [[death row]] at the [[Potosi Correctional Center]] near [[Mineral Point, Missouri|Mineral Point]], Missouri. In August 2013 the Missouri State Supreme Court announced that Franklin would be executed on November 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/08/15/execution-date-set-for-infamous-racist-serial-killer |title=Execution Date Set for Infamous Racist Serial Killer |publisher=Splcenter.org |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]] said in a statement that by setting execution dates, the state high court &quot;has taken an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 Aug 2013|first=Jim|last=Salter|title=Concern over pending Mo. executions|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/08/15/concerns-raised-over-pending-missouri-executions/jRrn2Xuq3gd3u5drmm6EUO/story.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Franklin's execution was complicated because it took place during [[Lethal injection#European Union export ban|a period]] when various European drug manufacturers refused or objected on moral grounds to having their drugs used in a [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21588916-technical-hitch-stays-executioners-needle-cruel-and-unusable?frsc=dg%7Ca|title=Cruel and unusable|work=The Economist|date=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response Missouri announced that it would use for Franklin's execution a new method of lethal injection, which used a single drug provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 Nov 2013|title=Missouri executes prisoner using single drug from secret pharmacy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/missouri-executes-joseph-paul-franklin-pentobarbital|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day before his execution, US District Judge [[Nanette Kay Laughrey|Nanette Laughrey]] ([[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]) granted a stay of execution over concerns raised about the new method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 19, 2013|title=US serial killer Joseph Franklin granted stay of execution|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25012654|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second stay was granted that evening by US District Judge [[Carol E. Jackson]] ([[St. Louis]]), based on Franklin’s claim that he was too mentally incompetent to be executed.  An appeals court quickly overturned both stays,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson-stay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-executes-white-supremacist-joseph-paul-franklin/article_2ccc002e-4105-5424-a7e6-e99702a1f644.html |title=Missouri executes white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin |publisher=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] subsequently rejected his final appeals.&lt;ref name=latimes1&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2013|title=Missouri executes serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-serial-killer-20131120,0,2989739.story|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2013|first=Lateef|last=Mungin|title=Serial killer Joseph Franklin executed after hours of delay|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/20/justice/missouri-franklin-execution/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' newspaper published on November 17, 2013, Franklin said he had renounced his racist views.  He said his motivation had been &quot;illogical&quot; and was partly a consequence of an abusive upbringing.  He said he had interacted with black people in prison, adding: &quot;I saw they were people just like us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wwwbbccouknewsworlduscanada&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/condemned-serial-killer-on-missouri-death-row-says-he-has/article_bff3dc15-9f96-5858-891a-a46d2ad5bd43.html  |title=Condemned serial killer on Missouri death row says he has remorse, is no longer a racist |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=November 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was executed at the [[Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center]] in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri|Bonne Terre]], Missouri on November 20, 2013.  The execution began at 6:07 AM CST and he was pronounced dead at 6:17 AM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson-stay&quot;/&gt; His execution was the first lethal injection in Missouri to use [[pentobarbital]] alone instead of the conventional [[Lethal injection#Conventional lethal injection protocol|three drug cocktail]].&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt;

An Associated Press news agency journalist said that 5g of the [[barbiturate]] pentobarbital was administered.  Franklin was pronounced dead ten minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 Nov 2013|title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three media witnesses said Franklin did not seem to show pain.  He did not make any final written statement and did not speak a word in the death chamber.  After the injection, he blinked a few times, breathed heavily a few times, and swallowed hard, the witnesses said.  The heaving of his chest slowed, and finally stopped, they said.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kohler|first=Jeremy|title=Missouri executes white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-executes-white-supremacist-joseph-paul-franklin/article_2ccc002e-4105-5424-a7e6-e99702a1f644.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard John Fraser''' (27 June 1951 – 1 January 2007), also known as &quot;The Rockhampton Rapist&quot;, was an [[Australia]]n convicted [[serial killer]].

== Biography ==
Fraser was born in [[Ingham, Queensland]]. He had a daughter in the 1970's with a woman named Pearl. He was also noted for having below average intelligence, to the point where he had trouble writing his own name.

== Crimes ==
Before a life sentence on 7 September 2000 for the abduction, [[rape]] and murder of a 9-year-old girl, [[Rockhampton, Queensland]], Leonard Fraser had spent almost 20 of the preceding 22 years behind bars for the rape of other women. He even raped a terminally ill cancer patient, with whom he was living with in early 1997. He was subsequently charged with four murders. Police found many trophies of his victims in his flat and [[ponytail]]s from three different women, which could not be traced to any of his known victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Bassingthwaighte| first =Ted | title =From Sexual Predator to Murderer| journal =Police news| publisher =[[New South Wales Police Association]]| date = November 2006| url =http://www.pansw.org.au/PolNews/Nov38-52.pdf| accessdate = 2 January 2007 | format = &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AFrom+Sexual+Predator+to+Murderer&amp;as_publication=Police+news&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050615215035/http://pansw.org.au/PolNews/Nov38-52.pdf| archivedate = 15 June 2005}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser originally confessed to five murders in an apparent deal with police to avoid general population in prison, but one of those victims was 14-year-old, [[Disappearance of Natasha Ryan|Natasha Ryan]], who was found to be alive and living secretly with her boyfriend in a nearby town after having been listed as a missing person for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=McCutcheon | title=Fraser trial judge criticises media commentary | date=14 April 2003 | publisher=ABC | url =http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2003/s832080.htm | work =The World Today | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was an obvious problem in his confessions to crimes where no corroborating evidence existed and there was therefore reason for a mistrial, his defence did not file for one. Nor did his defence object to the prosecution using the same confession made in custody, which included the Ryan confession, for three other victims whose remains were found. The Ryan 'murder' was also based on testimony from a fellow prisoner who alleged that Fraser drew detailed maps showing where Ms. Ryan's remains could be located.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Victim in murder trial found alive, but three others are definitely dead, say police | url =http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/10/1049567807305.html | accessdate = 11 April 2003 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the judge in the case, Justice Brian Ambrose, heavily criticised the media for commenting on the value of confessions to crimes made to police under duress or to other prisoners while in custody, where no or little corroborating evidence exists.

In 2003 Fraser was sentenced to three indefinite prison terms for the murders of Beverley Leggo and Sylvia Benedetti, and the manslaughter of Julie Turner in the Rockhampton area in 1998 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mako.org.au/pedofraser.html |title= Leonard John Fraser |accessdate=2 January 2007 |last=Doneman |first=Paula |work=Movement Against Kindred Offenders (M.A.K.O) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kim | last=Landers | title=Fraser guilty verdict | date=5 September 2003 | publisher=ABC | url =http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/qld/content/2003/s851395.htm | work =Stateline Queensland | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At his trial, the judge described him as a sexual predator who was a danger to the community and his fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news | title=Qld serial killer dies in hospital | date=1 January 2007 | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1820028.htm | work =ABC News | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Fraser was being held at the [[Wolston Correctional Centre]] and, after complaining of chest pains, he was taken to a secure section of the [[Princess Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Woolloongabba, Queensland|Woolloongabba]], on 26 December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paula |last=Doneman |title=Serial killer in hospital after heart scare |publisher=News.com.au |date=27 December 2006 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20977923-1248,00.html |accessdate=2 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218165802/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C20977923-1248%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he subsequently died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

'''The Freeway Killer''' was a nickname given by the media and later police forces&amp;mdash;to what they believed was a single [[serial killer]] claiming victims in California, United States, during the 1970s and often dumping the victims along freeways. However, there turned out to be three Freeway Killers who operated independently of each other, but just happened to select similar victims from similar locations.

The three killers were:

* [[Patrick Kearney]], age 37 when captured in 1977
* [[William Bonin]] and several accomplices, age 33 when captured in 1980
* [[Randy Steven Kraft]], age 38 when captured in 1983

'''Franz Fuchs''' (12 December 1949 [[Gralla (municipality)|Gralla]], [[Austria]] – 26 February 2000 [[Graz]], [[Austria]]) was a [[Racism|racist]] Austrian [[terrorism|terrorist]]. Between 1993 and 1997 he killed four people and injured 15, some of them seriously, using three [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) and five waves of 24 mailbombs in total.

Criminal psychologists characterized him as a highly intelligent but socially inept loner. His designated targets were people he either considered to be foreigners, or organisations and individuals &quot;friendly to foreigners&quot;.

== Mail bombs and IEDs ==
In December 1993 he started his first wave of [[mailbomb]]s. Early victims were the priest August Janisch (because of his help for [[refugee]]s), Silvana Meixner ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] journalist for [[minority group|minorities]]), and the [[List of mayors of Vienna|Mayor of Vienna]], [[Helmut Zilk]], who lost a large part of his left hand in the explosion. Other mailbombs which were discovered and neutralized were targeted at [[Helmut Schüller]] (humanitarian organisation [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]]), the [[Austrian Green Party|Green]] politicians [[Madeleine Petrovic]] and [[Terezija Stoisits]], [[Wolfgang Gombocz]] and Minister [[Johanna Dohnal]].

While attempting to disarm an [[improvised explosive device]] found at a bilingual school in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], police officer Theo Kelz lost both his hands on 24 August 1994. (Kelz subsequently became the first Austrian to receive a double [[Hand transplantation|hand transplant]], and made an impressive recovery.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgNkKNfmDDc |title=Theo Kelz hand transplantation |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Fuchs claimed responsibility for his attacks in a letter to the foreign minister of [[Slovenia]] in September 1994, in the name of the ''&quot;Salzburger Eidgenossenschaft – Bajuwarische Befreiungsarmee&quot;'' (Bajuvarian Liberation Army). In a number of subsequent letters, he tried to give the impression of a larger organisation with different units. However, from the second wave of mailbombs in October 1994 not a single one went off.

On 5 February 1995, four [[Romani people|Romani]] were killed in [[Oberwart]] with an [[improvised explosive device]] which was attached to a sign that read &quot;Roma zurück nach Indien&quot; (&quot;Romani back to India&quot;).

Between June 1995 and December 1995 he sent three more waves of mailbombs. Wave number three was targeted at TV host [[Arabella Kiesbauer]], Dietrich Szameit (vice-mayor of [[Lübeck]]) and a [[dating agency]]. Kiesbauer and Szameit did not open their letters themselves and were not hurt. Wave number four was targeted at two medics and a refugee aid worker, Maria Loley. One medic from [[Syria]] and Maria Loley were injured; the other mailbomb, targeted at a South Korean medic was discovered and neutralized. Two mailbombs of wave number five detonated early in mailboxes, the remaining two were discovered and neutralized. This was the last incident before Fuchs was arrested.

== Arrest, trial and death ==
[[File:Karlau DSCN7250.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[Graz-Karlau Prison]]]]
At this stage Fuchs had obviously become highly paranoid. On 1 October 1997 near his residence in Gralla, he followed two women in a car who he believed were observing him. When police attempted to question him on what they believed was a routine case of stalking, he produced another IED which he had kept in his car, and detonated it in his hands in front of the policemen. His suicide attempt failed, but he lost both hands, and also injured a nearby police officer. Fuchs was arrested without giving further resistance and, after a trial which many in Austria felt had fallen short of making all attempts to uncover deep details, was sentenced to [[life in prison]] on 10 March 1999. Through his unruly behavior during the trial, Fuchs had repeatedly forced his removal from court proceedings.

On 26 February 2000, Fuchs was found [[hanging|hanged]] with the cable of his electric razor in his prison cell at [[Graz-Karlau Prison]]. The prison physician determined it to be a [[suicide]].

== Unresolved questions ==
Although the case was officially closed after Fuchs had been sentenced, and although the &quot;Bajuvarian Liberation Army&quot; was determined to never have existed as a terrorist organization in the meaning of the term, doubts remained whether Fuchs had actually committed his actions without any support or tacit knowledge from sympathizers.

A thorough search of the two rooms in his parents' house where Fuchs had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which he would have needed to produce and handle the unstable explosives (including [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] and [[Nitroglycerin|nitroglycerol]]) contained in his IEDs.

Most of Fuchs' &quot;confession letters&quot; exhibited an aptitude at verbal expression for which he was not known. Some had referred to internal affairs in police procedures that were not accessible to the general public.

Even more doubts remain concerning Fuchs' death. How exactly a man without hands (Fuchs consistently refused having his advanced [[Transradial prosthesis|prosthetic arms]] fitted to him) and under almost constant video surveillance could accomplish the manipulations required to convert an electric cable into a [[noose]] sufficiently robust for successful self-hanging was never properly explained. Moreover, no prisoner (especially not an obvious [[borderline personality disorder]] case with a very recent record of suicidal behaviour) is supposed to be in possession of anything (including belts and even shoestrings) that could serve this purpose – most certainly not an electric cable.

== Media ==
*In 2007, the criminal case was portrayed in the [[docudrama]] ''[[Franz Fuchs – Ein Patriot]]'', the role of Franz Fuchs was played by Austrian [[Karl Markovics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1104065|title= Franz Fuchs – Ein Patriot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In computer games [[Hitman: Codename 47]] and [[Hitman: Contracts]], a character named Frantz Fuchs is an Austrian terrorist, who served in [[Hitlerjugend]] as a youngster, planning to blow up a hotel at which a peace summit is being held.

{{nihongo|'''Satarō Fukiage'''|吹上 佐太郎|''Fukiage Satarō''|extra=February 1889 – September 28, 1926}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[rape|rapist]] and [[serial killer]]. He killed at least seven girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= [[Atsushi Hachisu]]| title=Satarō Fukiage | publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/sei-1.htm |date=January 1994 | accessdate=2007-10-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070817021413/http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/sei-1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He murdered his first victim in 1906, and killed six girls between 1923 and 1924. He was tried for three out of six cases, but his exact number of victims is unknown.

He raped a number of women besides the murder victims and according to one theory, he raped at least 93 girls.&lt;ref name=yabusaka&gt;{{cite web | author= yabusaka| title=Satarō Fukiage Incident| publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/satarou.htm | date= July 19, 2007 | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates say he raped more than 100 women.&lt;ref name=monsters&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= CHILDREN KILLERS| publisher= MONSTERS | language=Japanese | url=http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~moonston/child.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto]]. His family forced him to work at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=kanga&gt;{{cite web | author= Eruo Kanga| title= Sex Crimes| publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://kodomo.s58.xrea.com/seihanzai.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently changed jobs. At the age of 11, he had sex with a girl about 17 years old, for which he lost his job.&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt; At 12, he was arrested for theft. Fukiage learned [[kana]] and [[math]] during the two months he spent in jail. He was arrested again for theft soon after his release, but learned [[classical Chinese]] while in jail the second time.

Fukiage had sex with a 54-year-old woman at the age of 17. He later raped the woman's 11-year-old daughter and some other girls in their neighborhood.

==First murder and imprisonment==
On September 24, 1906, he raped and [[murder]]ed an 11-year-old girl at [[Kinkaku-ji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kanga&quot;/&gt; The victim was an acquaintance of his. At the time he was culturally considered to be 18 years old, although he was 17 years old under the western age system. In jail, he studied the works of [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Nichiren]].&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt; He was released in 1922 and found employment, but he was fired due to his criminal past. In April 1923, he was arrested for [[child molestation|molesting]] a four-year-old girl, but was released.

==Later murders and arrest==
Between June 1923 and April 1924, he raped and murdered six girls, ages 11 to 16. He was arrested on July 28, 1924. He confessed to 13 murders, but later recanted, and insisting that he had murdered only six girls and that a police officer had asked him a leading question. He wrote a book, {{nihongo|''Shaba''|娑婆||&quot;The Street&quot;}}. He was sentenced to death on May 17, 1925. The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld his death sentence on July 2, 1926.

==Death==
He was executed by [[hanging]] on September 28, 1926. The media reported that he went to die nobly, unlike many prisoners.&lt;ref name=monsters/&gt; In his book, he requested that parents take care of their children.&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt;

'''William Patrick Fyfe''' (born February 27, 1955) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[serial killer]] convicted of killing five women in the [[Montreal]] area of [[Quebec]], although he claims to have killed four others. He allegedly killed his first victim in 1979 at age of 24.

==Early life==
Billy Fyfe was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He was raised by an aunt and moved from Central Canada to Montreal (Parc Extension) in 1958. He lived as a normal child, although friends did have suspicions about the boy as he grew up.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  As an adult, he worked as a [[handyman]].

==Murders==
[[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] on the door frame at Mary Glen's house led police to charge Fyfe for the murders. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) arrested him on 22 December 1999, while he was returning to his pick-up truck after eating at a Husky Truck Stop near Barrie, Ontario. He has confessed to only a portion of the crimes he is suspected of committing.

Fyfe's preliminary hearing began on 6 November 2000. Jean Lecours was the crown prosecutor heading up the case against Fyfe. He is now serving a [[life sentence]] in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Saskatchewan]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. The four last victims he admitted to only after being incarcerated {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

He is also suspected by Montreal Police of being the [[serial rapist]] commonly known as &quot;The Plumber&quot; who was responsible for a string of violent rapes during the 1980s in downtown Montreal {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} .

===Known victims===
* Hazel Scattolon, a 52-year-old woman who was stabbed to death  and sexually assaulted in 1981.
* Anna Yarnold, a 59-year-old woman who was bludgeoned to death  on 15 October 1999 in [[Senneville, Quebec|Senneville]], Quebec
* Monique Gaudreau, a 46-year-old woman who was stabbed to death on 29 October 1999 in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts]], Quebec.

{{DedhamHistory}}

'''Jason Fairbanks''' (September 25, 1780 &amp;ndash; September 10, 1801) was an [[United States|American]] [[murderer]]. Fairbanks came from a prominent family in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]]. He was the son of Ebenezer and Prudence Farrington Fairbanks and lived in the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]], today the oldest wood-framed house in the country. He was born with a lame arm. His sixth cousin, once removed, was Vice President [[Charles W. Fairbanks|Charles Fairbanks]].

==History==
Fairbanks had been courting Elizabeth Fales, the daughter of Nehemiah Fales, although she was resistant to marrying him. Finally on May 18, 1801, Fairbanks was determined to force her to make up her mind. He met with Fales in a birch grove next to &quot;Mason's pasture&quot; in Dedham, though the exact location today is not known.

Later, Fairbanks appeared at the Fales house, covered with blood and holding a knife. He told them that their daughter had committed suicide and he had tried to do the same but could not. She had been stabbed 11 times, including once in the back.

Fairbanks' wounds were serious; he was in no shape to be taken directly to jail. He was therefore taken into the Fales household, where he received medical treatment. On August 8, 1801, after a three-day trial and Elizabeth Fales' funeral on May 20, a jury indicted Fairbanks as an accessory to her death and he was jailed.

[[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]], the [[Attorney General of Massachusetts]], handled the prosecution. [[Harrison Gray Otis (lawyer)|Harrison Gray Otis]] and [[John Lowell, Jr. (lawyer)|John Lowell, Jr.]], two prominent [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] lawyers, defended Fairbanks. He was found guilty of the murder and was sentenced to death by hanging.

==Escape==
Before the execution could take place, Fairbanks escaped with the help of his brother, a cousin, a friend, and his nephew, Nathaniel Davis. A $1,000 bounty was placed on his head, and a newspaper headline screamed &quot;Stop the Murderer!&quot; The party tried to make their way to Canada, but stopped to eat in Skenesboro, now known as [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall, New York]], just south of the Canada–US border. Fairbanks was recaptured.
 
Fairbanks was returned to the [[Boston]] jail, for authorities no longer trusted the Dedham jail, and on September 10, 1801, Fairbanks was hanged at a massive event. He was twenty years old. Two Army cavalry companies and a volunteer militia unit made sure he did not escape again, and the 10,000 people who showed up at the Town Common to witness the execution were five times the town’s population at the time.

Within two days of his execution, the ''Report of the Trial of Jason Fairbanks'' was published. The story was then written up in a pamphlet entitled ''A Deed of Horror! Trial of Jason Fairbanks for the Murder of His Sweetheart'' in 1801. It became the basis for a novel called ''The Life of Jason Fairbanks: A Novel Founded on Fact'', which is believed to no longer exist.

'''Maznah Ismail''' (1 January 1956–2 November 2001), better known as '''Mona Fandey''', was a pop singer, [[witch doctor]], and a murderer from [[Malaysia]]. She was executed on 2 November 2001 at the age of 45, after being convicted of the [[murder]] of a politician, Mazlan Idris, in 1993.

==The murder==
After leaving the music business, she became involved in spiritual witchcraft activities and was known to be a ''[[bomoh]]'', a local [[shamanism|shaman]]. She began offering her services to clients, mostly from the upper-class society. She also claimed to have provided politician clients in the ruling party with a variety of charms and talismans.

It was reported that Mazlan Idris, a state assemblyman for the [[Parliamentary constituencies and state assemblies of Malaysia|constituency]] of [[Batu Talam]] in the state of [[Pahang]], wanted to boost his political career and sought the services of Mona for assistance. Mazlan was educated in the [[United States]] and was an ambitious politician from the ruling [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party. At that time, Mona worked with her husband Mohamad Nor Affandi Abdul Rahman, 44, and their assistant Juraimi Hassan, 31. Mona and her husband promised to help Mazlan by giving him a talisman consisting of a cane and ''[[sbatmi]]'' headgear which was supposedly owned by former [[Indonesia]]n President [[Sukarno]]. Mona convinced Mazlan that he would be &quot;invincible&quot; if he held the talisman.&lt;ref name=star&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/25/lifeliving/20070725170304&amp;sec=lifeliving &quot;Black magic mayhem&quot;], ''The Star'', 25 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Mona demanded [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 2.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;kyodo&quot; /&gt; Mazlan paid the couple RM 500,000 as deposit, and gave them 10 land titles as surety for the remaining RM 2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot; /&gt;

An appointment was made for cleansing rituals to be performed at Mona's house. Mazlan was told to lie on the floor face up while Mona placed flowers on him. She then told Mazlan to close his eyes and wait for the money to &quot;fall from the sky&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mona&quot; /&gt; Juraimi then, using an axe, chopped Mazlan's head off. They also dismembered and partially skinned Mazlan's body. His body was found in 18 parts buried in a storeroom near Mona's house in Kampung Peruas, Ulu Dong, Raub [[Pahang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot; /&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Mazlan was reported missing on 2 July 1993 after withdrawing RM 300,000 from a bank. After the murder, Mona was reported to have been on a shopping spree where she bought a Mercedes-Benz and had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kyodo&quot; /&gt; It was alleged that the murder occurred between 10:00 PM and 12 midnight on 18 July 1993. On 22 July 1993, police found Mazlan's body; Mona, her husband, and Juraimi were arrested and a highly publicised trial began. They were tried in [[Temerloh]] High Court by a 7-person jury (trial by jury was abolished from 1 January 1995). The High Court found all three of them guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced them to death]] by [[hanging]]. Mona and the others filed appeals to the Federal Court and in 1999 the court dismissed their appeals and upheld the death sentence. Finally, the three convicts sought to obtain a [[pardon]] or clemency from the Pardons Board of Pahang, their final chance redemption. However, the board refused to give clemency. The three were given a [[last meal]] of [[KFC]] on the night before their execution. Mona, Affandy, and Juraimi were finally hanged on 2 November 2001 at [[Kajang Prison]]. A prison official said the trio expressed no remorse at the pre-dawn execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1634584.stm &quot;Malaysia hangs three for witchcraft murder.&quot;], ''BBC News'', 2 November 2001. Accessed 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the trial, Mona exhibited strange behaviour including appearing cheerful, constantly smiling and posing for press photographers. She dressed extravagantly with bright and colourful designs on her dress.&lt;ref name=kyodo&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2001_Nov_5/ai_80631363 &quot;Malaysian trio hanged for ritual murder&quot;], ''Kyodo News International'', 5 November 2001. Accessed 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She also remarked, &quot;looks like I have many fans&quot;.&lt;ref name=nst&gt;[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/20070805082530/Article/index_html &quot;Butchered like animals&quot;], ''New Straits Times'', 5 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that during her execution she uttered the words &quot;''aku takkan mati''&quot;, meaning &quot;I will never die&quot;, and was still calm and smiling.&lt;ref name=mona&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/richard.clark32@btinternet.com/fandey.html Mona Fandey. A modern witchcraft murder.], ''Capital Punishment U.K''. Accessed 14 August 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504231145/http://www.geocities.com/richard.clark32@btinternet.com/fandey.html |date=4 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last female executed in Malaysia had been Tan Bee Lee in 1994 for a drug trafficking offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/femhanged.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Mona Fandey gained more notoriety than she had been when she was still a pop singer. There was wide local and even international media coverage and plenty of public interest. Anti-death penalty movements including [[Amnesty International]] voiced their opposition to the execution of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280042001?open&amp;of=ENG-376 &quot;Malaysia: Imminent execution&quot;], ''Amnesty International''. Accessed 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Malaysian film director [[Amir Muhammad (director)|Amir Muhammad]] made a short film entitled ''Mona'' in his ''6horts'' series. In 2006, a film by [[Dain Iskandar Said]] entitled ''[[Dukun (film)|Dukun]]'' was widely assumed to be based on Mona Fandey. This highly anticipated film has not been released as of December 2011 and will most likely not be released for public screenings due to concerns relating to the contents of the film, the relationship with Mona Fandey, and the implications for her family.&lt;ref&gt;Koay, Allan, [http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/3/nation/17899129&amp;sec=nation &quot;Will Dukun ever charm viewers?&quot;], ''The Star'', 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mona Fandey affair was one of the last [[jury trial]]s to be conducted in Malaysia. The sensational nature of the case contributed toward the government's decision to discontinue the jury system. All trials by jury were abolished on 1 January 1995.

'''Joseph Stanley Faulder''' (19 October 1937 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1999) was the first [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen to be [[execution|executed]] in the [[United States]] since 1952.

Stanley Faulder, a [[Jasper, Alberta]] native, was convicted of murdering Inez Scarborough Phillips, a 75-year-old woman, in [[Texas]] in 1975 during a robbery in her house. He was caught, convicted, and sentenced to death in 1977.

Despite diplomatic complaints by the Canadian government, Faulder was executed by lethal injection on 17 June 1999.

His last appeal was rejected about an hour before his death.

'''Victor Harry Feguer''' (1935&amp;nbsp;– March 15, 1963) was a convicted murderer and the last [[federal inmate]] [[capital punishment|executed]] in the United States before the moratorium on the death penalty following ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', and the last person put to death in the state of [[Iowa]]. While at the time the news media paid little attention to Victor Feguer or his execution, [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s execution sparked renewed media interest in Feguer.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

==Background==
Feguer was a drifter, native to the state of [[Michigan]]. In the summer of 1960, Feguer arrived in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], renting a room at a decrepit boarding house. Soon after arriving, Feguer began phoning [[physician]]s alphabetically from the local [[Yellow Pages]] and found Dr. Edward Bartels. Feguer claimed that a woman needed medical attention. When Dr. Bartels arrived, Feguer kidnapped him and killed him in [[Illinois]]. Bartels' body was found in a cornfield there with a single gunshot to the head. A few days later, Feguer was arrested in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], after trying to sell Dr. Bartels' car.

Authorities believe that Feguer had kidnapped and killed Dr. Bartels in order to gain access to any drugs that Bartels may have carried to treat patients. Because Feguer transported his hostage across state lines, federal charges were filed against Feguer. In his defense, Feguer claimed that a drug addict from [[Chicago]], whom Feguer met in Dubuque, had actually murdered Bartels. Feguer claimed that he killed the drug addict and dumped his body in the [[Mississippi River]]. However, authorities could not find any evidence that this other person ever existed.

Feguer was tried and convicted in federal court for these crimes. He was sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. Feguer submitted an appeal, which was denied. At that point, only President [[John F. Kennedy]] could have commuted the death sentence. Iowa's governor, [[Harold Hughes]], a death penalty opponent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase&quot;/&gt; along with Feguer's attorney, contacted Kennedy to request clemency for Feguer. Kennedy thought that the crime was so brutal that he denied their request. 

==Feguer's last days==
===Feguer on Death Row at Fort Madison===
Victor Feguer was held at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|federal penitentiary at Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]]. He was brought back to Iowa because Leavenworth was not set up at the time to perform executions.

On March 5, 1963, Feguer was brought to the [[Iowa State Penitentiary]] at [[Fort Madison, Iowa]] and placed in the state's death row to await execution. He remained there for the next ten days until his execution was carried out. He spent those ten days quietly; guards felt he was a model prisoner.

===March 15, 1963===

Between 4 and 5 in the morning of March 15, Feguer was given a new suit for his execution. Two guards escorted him to the gallows, and he was hanged at dawn. The witnesses included an [[Associated Press]] journalist and [[John Ely (Iowa politician)|John Ely]], then a member of the [[Iowa House of Representatives]], whose witnessing of the execution reinforced his opposition to the death penalty, leading him to work to abolish the state death penalty in Iowa, which occurred in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/06/us/federal-executions-have-been-rare-but-may-increase.html |title=Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase |first=Carey |last=Goldberg |date=May 6, 2001 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which had no effect on the federal law under which Feguer had been executed.

The body was removed by a local [[funeral home]]. Victor Feguer's death certificate listed &quot;fracture cervical spinal column&quot; as the cause of death. Feguer was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Madison, wearing a second new suit that was provided for his burial.

==Aftermath==
Victor Feguer would be the last person to be executed in Iowa. After Feguer's death, it would be nearly 40 years until the next federal execution – that of [[Timothy McVeigh]], carried out on June 11, 2001, in [[Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]].

Iowa abolished [[capital punishment]] for all crimes in 1965. Over the years, several attempts had been made to reinstate the [[death penalty]] in Iowa. This became a major issue in the 1994 election, as a young girl had recently been murdered, as well as in 2005 after the murder of another young girl. However, the legislature declined to reinstate the death penalty.

Previous Iowa Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] made it clear that he would [[veto]] legislation that would restore the death penalty, even if it would only be on a limited basis. {{As of|2013}}, Iowa is one of 18 U.S. states to have completely abolished [[capital punishment]].

'''Ellis Wayne Felker''' (c. 1948 &amp;ndash; November 15, 1996) was convicted and [[executed]] for murder.

==History==
Felker was convicted for aggravated sodomy in 1977 and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, but was paroled after four.&lt;ref&gt;Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 655 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis Wayne Felker was convicted and executed for the 1981 disappearance and murder of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] woman, Evelyn Joy Ludlam. Ludlam was working her way through college as a cocktail waitress. Felker invited her to meet with him under the pretense of a job opportunity at his leather shop, which Joy Ludlam was attracted to because of the contradiction between her job and her religious beliefs.  He was put under police surveillance for 2 weeks (because, when Ludlam's car was found abandoned in Warner Robins, there was a datebook with an entry mentioning a meeting with Felker later in the day after her last sighting), during which time Ludlam's body was found in a creek, raped, and murdered by asphyxiation.

===Controversy===
An [[autopsy]] performed determined that Ludlam had been dead for 5 days when found.  This finding would eliminate Felker as a suspect due to his surveillance, however the findings were changed.  Later study of the autopsy notes by independent analysis showed that Ludlam had been dead no more than 3 days when found. However, since Ludlam's body was found in running water in late autumn, the exact time of death was difficult to determine. Dr Whitaker testified for the state that the air temperature, the state of decomposition, the fact that Ludham had been found wearing the same clothes as when she was last seen, and the fact that missing and murdered persons die soon after they disappear would suggest that Ludham had died 2 weeks before her body was found.

In September 1996, as a result of an Open Records Act lawsuit, Felker's attorneys received boxes of evidence that had been unlawfully withheld by the prosecution (although Felker's Brady claims arising from this evidence were rejected). This evidence included possible [[DNA]] samples of the perpetrator{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, a witness statement to having seen Ludham after Felker claimed to have last seen her (although the witness did identify Felker as being with the victim at that time) and a signed confession made in 1988 by another suspect who was mentally retarded and contained numerous discrepancies. For example, describing Ludham as a security guard rather than a cocktail waitress, and claiming to have stabbed rather than strangled Ludham. The [[District attorney|District Attorney]] in charge denied under oath that such evidence existed and the presiding judge at one of Felker's hearings stated that Felker's right to a fair trial had been severely compromised {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

==Execution==
Despite doubts of his guilt, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] refused to order a new trial or even grant a stay long enough to sort through the mountains of paperwork in the case that had been withheld allowing the defense time to investigate the case further for possible [[exoneration]]. This was because he had been on death row for some time and had not appealed any of the evidence until a death warrant was issued.

Felker was originally scheduled to be executed in May 1996, but a stay was granted and the execution was delayed during the [[Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and he was eventually executed on November 15, 1996 at the age of 48.

Ellis Wayne Felker was put to death by electrocution in Georgia's electric chair at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center in Jackson, GA. The previous night, when fellow death row inmate [[Larry Grant Lonchar]] was executed for three murders, Felker had requested to be able to videotape Lonchar's execution to prove that the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  The next time an execution would be videotaped would be that of [[Andrew Grant DeYoung]] on July 21, 2011.

==Exoneration attempt==
In 2000, a Georgia judge ruled that DNA testing would be performed in the first-ever attempt by a court to exonerate an executed person in the United States.  The results were ruled as inconclusive; however this finding alone would not have been enough to grant a new trial, or exoneration and release.

'''Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers''' (18 August 1720 &amp;ndash; 5 May 1760) was an English nobleman, notable for being the last [[peerage|peer]] to be [[hanging|hanged]], following his conviction for murdering his steward.

==Biography==
Lord Ferrers, descendant of an ancient and noble family, was the eldest son of the Honourable Laurence Ferrers, himself the third son of the [[Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers|first Earl Ferrers]]. At the age of twenty, he quit his [[Estate (house)|estates]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] education, and began living a debauched life in Paris. At the age of twenty-five he inherited his title from his insane uncle the [[Henry Shirley, 3rd Earl Ferrers|3rd Earl Ferrers]], and with it estates in [[Leicestershire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]]. He lived, however, at [[Staunton Harold Hall]] in northwest Leicestershire. In 1752, he married Mary, the youngest sister of [[Sir William Meredith, 3rd Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earl Ferrers|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ferrers.html|website=capitalpunishmentuk.org|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Meredith|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p28319.htm#i283182|website=ThePeerage.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrers was also a cousin to [[Selina, Countess of Huntingdon]], the prominent [[Methodist]] lady and supporter of [[George Whitefield]], though he was not involved in the Methodist revival.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Marriage troubles===
It was said that there was [[insanity]] in his family, and from an early age his behaviour seems to have been eccentric, and his temper violent, though he was quite capable of managing his [[business]] affairs. Significantly, in 1758, his wife obtained a separation from him for [[cruelty]], which would have been rare for the time. She would not accept her husband's drinking and womanizing, and was particularly upset by his illegitimate children. The old family steward, Johnson, may have given evidence on Mary's behalf and was afterwards tasked with collecting rents due to her. She was married again, on 28 March 1769, to [[Lord Frederick Campbell]]. Mary later died in a fire at her country seat, Coomb Bank, [[Kent]], on 25 July 1807.{{sfn|Hamilton|1886|p=195}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

===Murder===
[[File:Earl Ferrers shooting his steward.JPG|left|thumb|150px|18th century illustration of Lord Ferrers shooting his steward, from [[the Newgate Calendar]]]]
The Ferrers' estates were then vested in [[trustee]]s; Ferrers secured the appointment of an old family steward named Johnson, as receiver of rents. This man faithfully performed his duty as a servant to the trustees, and did not prove amenable to Ferrers' personal wishes. On 18 January 1760, Johnson called at the earl's [[mansion]] at [[Staunton Harold]], [[Leicestershire]], by appointment, and was directed to his lordship's study. Here, after some business conversation, Lord Ferrers shot him. Johnson didn't die immediately, but instead was given some treatment at the hall followed by continued verbal abuse from a drunken Ferrers before a Dr. Kirkland was able to convey him to his own home where he died the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earl Ferrers|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ferrers.html|website=CapitalPunishmentUK.org|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following April Ferrers was tried for [[murder]] by his [[peerage|peer]]s in [[Westminster Hall]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Charles Pratt]] leading for the prosecution.{{sfn|Thomas|2008}} Shirley's defence, which he conducted in person with great ability, was a plea of insanity, and it was supported by considerable evidence, but he was found guilty. According to [[Horace Walpole|Lord Orford]], &quot;Lord Ferrers was not mad enough to be struck with [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Lady Huntingdon's]] sermons. The [[Methodism|Methodists]] have nothing to brag of his conversion, though [[George Whitefield|Whitefield]] prayed for him.&quot; Ferrers subsequently said that he had only pleaded insanity to oblige his family, and that he had himself always been ashamed of such a defence.{{sfn|Asked by the Lord High Steward &quot;why judgement of death should not pass upon you according to law,&quot; he answered &quot;I am extremely sorry that I have troubled your lordships with a defence that I was always much averse to, and has given me the greatest uneasiness; but was prevailed on by my family to attempt it as it was what they themselves were persuaded of the truth of ... .&quot; 19 Howell State Trials 885, 957-58. [A free download from Google Books.] This is a fairly authoritative source and contains a full transcript of the proceedings, including the witnesses. The verdict of guilt was unanimous, including the peers who were judges. The tone of the trial was set by Pratt, known better to history as Lord Camden and later both Lord Chief Justice of Common Pleas and then Lord Chancellor. He opened the case with the calm statement: &quot;My lords, as I never thought it my duty in any case to attempt at eloquence, where a prisoner stood upon trial for his life; much less shall I think myself justified in doing it before your lordships; give me leave therefore to proceed to a narration of the facts.&quot; 19 Howell 895. He then summarized the facts as the witnesses would testify without any emotive coloring and concluded: &quot;If he has any defence, God forbid that he should not have a fair opportunity of making it. Let him be heard with patience. The prosecutors will be as glad as your lordships to find him innocent.&quot; At 902. Anyone who is familiar with U.S. juries would expect most to reach the same verdict on the same evidence.}}

===Execution===
On 5 May 1760, dressed in a light-coloured suit embroidered with silver (the outfit he had worn at his wedding), he was taken in his own [[carriage]] from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] and there hanged by [[Thomas Turlis]].{{sfn|Kaufman-Osborn|2002|p=77}} There are several illustrations of the hanging. It has been said that as a concession to his rank the rope used was of [[silk]]. After the execution his body was taken to Surgeon's Hall for public exhibition and dissection. The execution was widely publicised in popular culture as evidence of equality of the law and the story of a wicked nobleman who was executed &quot;like a common criminal&quot; was told well into the 1800s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--For everything since the last citation--&gt;

'''Jacques Fesch''' (April 6, 1930, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] – October 1, 1957, [[La Santé Prison]], [[Paris]]) was the [[murder]]er of a [[French National Police|French police officer]], who became such a devout [[Roman Catholic]] while in prison awaiting [[capital punishment|execution]] that he has been proposed for beatification.

==Early life==
Fesch's father was a wealthy banker of [[Belgium|Belgian]] origin, an artist and [[atheist]], distant from his son and who get along with his wife. Jacques was a young dreamer aimlessly in life; brought up a Roman Catholic, he abandoned religion by the age of 17. At 21, he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a [[civil marriage|civil ceremony]]. He gave up a position at his father's bank, lived the life of a playboy, left his wife and their daughter, and fathered an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son with another woman. Disillusioned with his life, he dreamed of escaping to sail around the [[South Pacific Ocean]], but his parents refused to pay for a boat.

==Crime==
On 24 February 1954, to fund the purchase of a boat, he went to rob Alexandre Sylberstein, a [[bureau de change|money changer]], of [[gold coin]]s. Sylberstein was struck but not unconscious, and raised the alarm. Fesch fled, losing his [[eyeglasses|glasses]], and shot wildly at Jean Vergne, a pursuing police officer, killing him. Minutes later he was arrested. Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion, inflamed by newspaper reports, was strongly in favour of his execution. The [[Cour d'assises]] of Paris condemned him to death on 6 April 1957.

== Religious conversion ==
At first Fesch was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer's Catholic faith. However, after a year in prison, he experienced a profound mystical conversion, became very pious, and bitterly regretted his crime. He corresponded regularly with his family, notably his brother and stepmother, and kept a spiritual [[personal journal|journal]]. He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution. His last journal entry was &quot;In five hours, I will see [[Jesus]]!&quot;.  An appeal for [[clemency]] to [[President of France|President]] [[René Coty]] failed, and he was [[guillotine]]d.

==Legacy==
After his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. At first he was excoriated by the public, but with the work of Soeur Véronique, a [[Carmelite]] nun, and Father Augustin-Michel Lemonnier, the family effected publication of his writings, and from the 1970s these served as an inspiration to many.

On September 21, 1987 the [[Archbishop of Paris]], Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]], opened a diocesan inquiry into his life; the cause for his [[beatification]] was formally opened in 1993. This has proved controversial, with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">'''Joseph Filkowski''' ('''''John Blake''''') (died 1931) was a [[Polish-American]] gangster in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

A longtime figure in Cleveland's underworld, Joseph Filkowski led the Polish bootlegging gang, the Flats Mob. In October 1930, he and two other gang members held a police officer captive during the gangs hold up of the Dixie Shoe Company, relieving him of both his gun and uniform. 

Although successfully escaping, the incident resulted in gaining the attention of local law enforcement and, although escaping from a police trap on December 6, Filkowski associate [[Joseph Stazek]] was killed by Cleveland detectives the following day. Two days later, on December 9, a Patrolman Patrick McNeely accidentally shot [[Joseph Fortini]], a district circulation manager of the newspaper ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', who McNeely had mistaken for Filkowski. The Fortini shooting would begin a lengthy, yet ultimately unresolved, inquiry into the use of police firearms. 

The majority of the gang were eventually captured by authorities and sentenced to life imprisonment with the exception of Filkowski, who was sentenced to death. Filkowski's [[death mask]] is on display in the [[Cleveland Police History Museum]].

'''Melbert Ray Ford, Jr.''' (December 9, 1960 – June 9, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] convicted double murderer who in 2010 was executed by lethal injection by the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|U.S. state of Georgia]] after being convicted of murder in 1987.

Ford was born in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|America]]. He was convicted in 1987 of killing his former girlfriend, Martha Chapman Matich, and Lisa Chapman, her 11-year-old niece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.covnews.com/news/article/12534/ |title=Execution rescheduled for Melbert Ray Ford |publisher=Covnews.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a March 6, 1986 robbery at Chapman’s Grocery store  in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://off2dr.com/modules/extcal/event.php?event=326 |title=Melbert Ray Ford - Georgia Death Row - Scheduled Execution : Pro Death Penalty Information - Scheduled Executions |publisher=Off2dr.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford had told a friend that he “was going to blow her brains out,” and devised a plan to rob the store, saying he intended to kidnap Matich, take her into the woods, make her beg and then shoot her in the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtvm.com/Global/story.asp?S=12521035 ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Ford was executed by lethal injection on June 9, 2010.  He was the 24th inmate put to death by [[List of individuals executed in Georgia (U.S. state)|lethal injection in the U.S state of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcor.state.ga.us/GDC/OffenderQuery/jsp/OffQryRedirector.jsp{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously granted a 90-day stay in mid-February because there was a vacancy on the Georgia [[Board of directors|Board]] of Pardons and Paroles. A court had previously held that to go forward with an execution without a full five-member board is a violation of the Georgia Constitution.

Georgia's Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Ford on June 9. which could have stayed his execution on the same day. The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously denied Ford's motion to halt his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/rss_story.aspx?storyid=145044 |title=Melbert Ford Executed Wednesday Night |publisher=11alive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 9, 2010, Ford was executed by lethal injection.

'''George Forster''' (or '''Foster''') was found guilty of murdering his wife and child by drowning them in [[Paddington Canal]], [[London]]. He was [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Newgate]] on 18 January 1803, shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by [[Italy|Italian]] scientist [[Giovanni Aldini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Newgate Calendar]] |url=http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng464.htm |title=George Foster Executed at Newgate, 18th of January, 1803, for the Murder of his Wife and Child, by drowning them in the Paddington Canal; with a Curious Account of Galvanic Experiments on his Body |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial the events were reconstructed. Forster's mother in law recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see Forster at 4 p.m. on Saturday 4 December 1802. Joseph Bradfield, in whose house Forster lodged, reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning. He also stated that Forster and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him. Various witnesses saw Forster with his wife and child in public houses near Paddington Canal during the day on the Sunday. The body of his child was found on the Monday morning and, after the canal was dragged for three days, his wife's body was also found.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Forster claimed that upon leaving The Mitre he set out alone for [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] in order to see his other two children who were in the [[workhouse]] there, though he was forced to turn back at [[Whetstone, London|Whetstone]] due to the failing light. This was contradicted by a waiter at the Mitre who said the three left the inn together. Scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to Whetstone in the time he claimed. The jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter. This sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment, but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on [[Judgement Day]], their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded. Forster was hanged on 18 January, shortly before which he made a full confession. He said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

A recent ''[[BBC Knowledge]]'' documentary (''Real Horror: Frankenstein'') questions the fairness of the trial. It notes that friends of George Forster's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter. According to this documentary, Forster attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife. This was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body, should he not have died when hanged. This was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time. The same reference suggests that his 'confession' was obtained under duress. In fact, it alleges that Pass, a [[Beadle]] on Aldini's payroll, fast-tracked the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor.

[[File:A Galvanised Corpse.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a galvanised corpse]]After the execution Forster's body was given to [[Giovanni Aldini]] for experimentation. Aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist [[Luigi Galvani]] and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle's method of stimulating muscles with electric current, known as [[Galvanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/History/early-nineteen.htm |title=Early Nineteenth century electrochemistry |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment he performed on Forster's body was a demonstration of this technique. ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]'' (a record of executions at Newgate) reports that, &quot;On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened. In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Several of those present believed that Forster was being brought back to life (''The Newgate Calendar'' reports that even if this had been so, he would have been re-executed since his sentence was to &quot;hang until he be dead&quot;) and one man, Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt; The hanged man was certainly dead, since his blood had been drained and his [[spinal cord]] severed after the execution.

==Media==
*The [[Galvanism]] experiment performed on George Forster was explored in the [[Science Channel]]'s ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]''.
*George Forster was noted on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] show called, ''Zombies: A Living History''

'''Robert Foulkes''' (baptised 19 March 1633/34-died 31 January 1678/79), was a [[Wales]]-born  [[English people|English]] [[Church of England]] clergyman and [[murderer]].

Although long presumed to have been a native of [[Shropshire]] in England, Foulkes was born and baptised at [[Mallwyd]], Wales, son of namesake Robert Foulkes and is known to have had an older sibling, brother John, with whom he attended [[Shrewsbury School]] in 1648-49.&lt;ref name=klein&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Peter|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|year=2005|publisher=Merlin Unwin Books|pages=27-28|isbn=1-873674-71-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foulkes, sums up [[Anthony Wood|Anthony à Wood]], ‘became a [[servitor]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in Michaelmas term 1651, where he continued more than four [[years]], under the [[tuition]] and [[government]] of [[Presbyterians]] and independents. Afterwards entering into the [[sacred]] function he became a [[preacher]], and at length [[vicar]] of [[Stanton Lacy]] in his own county of [[Shropshire]], and took to him a [[wife]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Athenæ Oxon. ed. Bliss, iii. 1195&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foulkes married on 7 September 1657, at [[St Laurence's Church, Ludlow|Ludlow parish church]], Isabella, daughter of Thomas Colbatch (died 1637), a deceased former rector of the same parish, three years before his induction as vicar at Stanton Lacy on 12 September 1660.&lt;ref name=klein2&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children, born between 1665 and 1673.&lt;ref name=klein3&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Isabella had been brought up in the home of Stanton Lacy's previous vicar, Thomas Atkinson (died 1657)&lt;ref name=klein4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=25,29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other children Atkinson had left a daughter, Ann (born about 1650), with whom Foulkes began a relationship rumoured to be going on as early as 1669.&lt;ref name=klein5&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foulkes, who had been a zealous preacher in the early years of his incumbency, was later reported seen publicly misbehaving with Atkinson and became a heavy drinker at local alehouses. 

There was speculation when Atkinson was sent away from the parish to give birth at [[West Felton]] to an illegitimate baby girl, born in or about May 1674, held to have been sent for fostering by a wet-nurse elsewhere; her [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] was never firmly proved but was allegedly Foulkes's.&lt;ref name=klein8&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=38-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1676, Foulkes was admonished by the [[Bishop of Hereford]], [[Herbert Croft (bishop)|Herbert Croft]], after complaints about the relationship and other misbehaviours were brought before a [[consistory court]] in Ludlow,&lt;ref name=klein6&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=43-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also reportedly beat his wife and a churchwarden who tried to intervene at his rectory house on the same night, after drinking at a [[bowls|bowling]] match.&lt;ref name=klein7&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=47-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He [[seduced]] the young [[lady]] who resided with him, took a lodging for her in York Buildings in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], and there made away with the [[child]] that was born on 11 December 1678, by stabbing it in the throat with a knife and disposing of the body down a privy emptying into the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=klein9&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=100-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Contrary to popular assertion, given in two contemporary pamphlets, the child was not strangled by him.&lt;ref name=klein10&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;)The next [[morning]] he returned to Shropshire. When the body was found 'by a Strange Providence',&lt;ref name=klein11&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson eventually made a full [[Confession (religion)|confession]].

Foulkes was [[tried]] and [[convicted]] at the [[Old Bailey]] [[Quarter Sessions|sessions]], 16 January 1678–9. After receiving [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] he manifested great [[penitence]], and was visited by several eminent divines, among whom was [[Gilbert Burnet]]. [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], dean of Bangor, who came to him the very evening after his condemnation, managed to obtain for him, through Compton, [[Bishop of London]], a few days' reprieve, which he employed in [[writing]] forty pages of cant, entitled ‘An Alarme for Sinners: containing the [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Prayers]], Letters, and [[Last Words (book)|Last Words]] of Robert Foulkes, … with an Account of his Life. [[Published]] from the Original, Written with his own hand, … and sent by him at his Death to Doctor Lloyd,’ 4to, [[London]], 1679. He speaks of his unfortunate companion with ill-concealed malignity. On the morning of 31 January 1678–9 he was [[executed]] at [[Tyburn]], ‘not with other common [[felons]], but by himself,’ and was buried by night at [[St. Giles-in-the-Fields]].

'''Richard Edwin Fox''' (February 3, 1956 &amp;ndash; February 12, 2003) was executed by the state of [[Ohio]] for the [[kidnapping]] and [[murder]] of an 18-year-old college student whom he lured to her death with the fake promise of a [[job interview]].

A three-judge panel convicted Fox of aggravated murder and kidnapping and sentenced him to death on June 27, 1990. He spent 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days on [[death row]] as his case was appealed through the state and federal court systems.

==The crime==
The crime for which Fox paid with his life was his first criminal conviction, but Fox had been increasingly aggressive toward women in the months before the murder of 18-year-old Leslie Renae Keckler, testimony at his trial revealed. In fact, it was the victim of a previous encounter with Fox who helped police break the case.

On September 14, 1989, Leslie Keckler applied for a waitress job at a [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] restaurant where Fox worked as a grill cook. As Keckler was filling out her job application, Fox pointed out Keckler to a coworker and said &quot;I'd like to have some of that&quot;, the coworker testified later. Fox gleaned Keckler's telephone number from the application and asked her to meet him for an interview for a restaurant supply sales job. 

On September 26, Keckler went to a local motel where Fox had arranged the job interview. Keckler's boyfriend saw her just before she left and Keckler told him she might be gone for two or three hours. When Keckler did not return that night, her boyfriend and her mother filed a missing persons report with police. Police found the car Keckler had been driving abandoned at a local mall.

Four days later, two boys riding bicycles found Keckler's body in a rural drainage ditch. Keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket. However, a clasp on her brassiere was broken, her belt was unbuckled, two dress buttons were missing, and her pantyhose was torn in the crotch. Aside from a nearby shoe, police found no other evidence at the scene.

==Wounds==
The [[autopsy]] revealed that Keckler had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds. She had been stabbed six times in the back; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs. Her right wrist had a deep [[Defense wound|defensive wound]] gash, and her face had bruises on her left eye, upper lip, and nose consistent with [[blunt force injury]]. The coroner found no signs of sexual assault.

==Previous attack==
When the story of Keckler's murder was publicized, another Bowling Green woman came forward with a nearly similar story. She had applied for work at a restaurant and received an invitation for an interview for a different position from a man referred to as &quot;Jeff Bennett&quot; but who was later positively identified as Fox. He asked her to come to a local motel&amp;mdash;the same one that Keckler was headed&amp;mdash;to discuss the job opportunity.

After meeting Fox, she agreed to accompany him in his car that evening to discuss the job. They drove for a while and then parked. Fox began making suggestive comments and told the woman he thought her dress was too long. She realized that she had been duped and informed Fox that she was not interested in any job. 

In response, Fox asked what the woman would do if someone &quot;pulled a knife&quot; on her and asked her for money, or asked her &quot;to do other things&quot;. At that moment, the woman jumped out of the car as Fox tried to grab her and said &quot;come back&quot; and that he &quot;wasn't finished with [her] yet&quot;.

She made a safe getaway, but did not report the incident to police until after Keckler disappeared. The woman provided police with a sketch of her assailant.

==Investigation==
A check of the employees at the restaurants where the two women applied for jobs revealed an interesting coincidence: Fox was employed at both places. Other [[circumstantial evidence]] made Fox their prime suspect. On October 2, an acquaintance of Fox told police that the composite sketch resembled Richard Fox of Tontogany. Police confirmed that Fox matched the description of &quot;Bennett&quot; and Fox's car also matched the description of &quot;Bennett's&quot; car.

That same day, police secured a [[search warrant]] for Fox's car and found some &quot;suspicious items&quot;. They asked Fox to come to the station to answer a few questions and he voluntarily accompanied them. 

Before Fox was placed under arrest, he admitted that in early May he had worked at a restaurant where his first intended victim had applied for a job, that he met her at the motel, and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length.

==Arrest and admissions==
After his arrest and after being advised of his [[Miranda rights]], Fox admitted he knew Keckler and claimed they had met and spoke at the restaurant where he worked and met again a couple of days later. He described his encounter with Keckler at the motel on September 26 as a date. Later, at the mall, &quot;he saw Leslie and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car&quot;. Fox said that he and Keckler parked, and &quot;things were getting warmed up&quot;. However, &quot;then Leslie did not want to participate&quot;. 

Unwittingly, Keckler triggered something in Fox's psyche as she tried to get away from him. She called him &quot;an asshole&quot; and started to get out of the car. Fox told detectives, &quot;no one calls me an asshole&quot;. Fox grabbed the woman by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in, then he pulled the coat up over her head.

Fox told police he got a knife out of the glove compartment and stabbed Keckler in the back, after which he got a rope out of the trunk &quot;just to make sure she was dead&quot; and strangled her. He took police to a rural location outside Bowling Green where he dumped Keckler's purse and other property.

==Clemency hearing and execution==
At Fox's clemency hearing where the parole board listens to arguments why it should or should not recommend that the governor commute a death sentence, it was revealed that Fox had written a letter apologizing to the Keckler family for his actions:

: &quot;If I could, I would sit down with my victim's family and try and share how sorry I am, how I have changed and how I wish I could change what happened. I am sorry, and I must pay for my actions, if it be with a life in prison or if it be by my life, I will do what is required as I know I must pay for my mistakes!&quot;

Neither that letter nor his teenage daughter's tearful plea not to be made an orphan (her mother had earlier committed suicide) swayed the [[parole]] board. Fox made no statement before he was injected with the deadly chemicals. The execution took a total of 13 minutes from the time the first chemical was started until Fox was declared dead.

[[File:Sidney Harry Fox.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sidney Harry Fox, police mugshot]]
'''Sidney Harry Fox''' (born?-died 8 April 1930) was a [[British people|British]] petty swindler and murderer. He was executed for the murder of his mother in an attempt to obtain money from an insurance policy on her life. His case is unusual in that it is a rare example of a known [[matricide]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

His murder was detected by then recent advances in [[forensic pathology]].

==Early life==
Fox was described as &quot;the son of decent working Norfolk parents&quot;;&lt;ref name = papers&gt;{{cite news |date=19 May 1930 |page=4 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19300519.2.14 |title=Career of Crime: The Murderer Fox |newspaper=[[Evening Post (London)|Evening Post]] |accessdate=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; little is known of his father, although it has been said that he was a railway porter. Fox was in trouble in his teens as a petty thief while in service at good houses, for which he was [[Birching|birched]].&lt;ref name = papers/&gt; Learning from his association with people of quality, he later developed a role as a plausible, genteel con-man until [[World War I]], when he obtained a job in a London bank and proceeded to [[forgery|forge]] cheques on the accounts of his customers. On discovery of his dishonesty in 1916, Britain was then in the middle of the [[Great War]] and needed soldiers. Fox was offered immunity from prosecution on condition that he enlisted in the Army, however he enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]], getting an officer's commission by claiming to be an [[Old Etonian]]. He drew on his banking experience to forge cheques on his brother officers' accounts. He was caught and sent to prison for three months, ending his military career.&lt;ref name = papers/&gt;

==The murder==
Fox and his mother Rosaline lived on 18 shillings per week (£{{Inflation|UK|0.90|1929|2010|r=0}} equivalent in 2010) between them, supplementing this by cashing worthless cheques and moving from town to town. In 1927, Fox was imprisoned for fraud and his mother committed to the [[workhouse]]. On his release, he commenced a bogus affair with a Mrs Morse for mercenary reasons; she knew nothing of his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|1984|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the access given to steal her jewellery, and he also insured her life for £6000 (£{{Inflation|UK|6000|1929|2010|r=0}} in 2010). Mrs Morse awoke one evening to find the gas-tap in her bedroom turned on. The resultant outcry led to a divorce action being filed by Mr. Morse, naming Fox as co-respondent. Fox was arrested on several charges, imprisoned for the jewellery theft and released in March 1929; he and his mother found it convenient to renew their travelling life.

In April 1929 Fox persuaded his mother to make a will in his favour, despite her poverty, and on May 1, insured her life against accidental death, the policy to expire on 23 October. Some months later, they arrived at a hotel in [[Margate]] without any luggage and booked rooms. A week later, on 23 October, Fox and his mother ate dinner, Fox buying a half-bottle of port as a &quot;[[nightcap (beverage)|nightcap]]&quot; for her. At 11.40 pm that evening, Fox raised the alarm that there was a fire in his mother's room, and her partly clad body was pulled out of it by another guest.

Although a doctor certified [[asphyxia|suffocation]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] as the cause of death, and Rosaline Fox was buried in Norfolk a week later, the insurance investigators had examined the room and were suspicious. They believed that a patch of unburnt carpet between Mrs Fox's body and the gas stove supposedly the source of the flames made Fox's story inconsistent. As a result, Mrs Fox's body was exhumed for [[forensic examination]].

[[Sir Bernard Spilsbury]] performed the [[post-mortem]] and deduced that Mrs Fox had been [[strangling|strangled]] to death, due to a bruise on her [[larynx]], and the absence of [[soot]] in her lungs showed that she had been dead before the fire had started. As a result, Fox was arrested and charged with the murder.

==Trial==
Fox was tried at [[Lewes Crown Court|Lewes Assizes]] before [[Mr Justice Rowlett]], with Sir [[Henry Curtis-Bennett]] and [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Sir William Jowitt]] (then the [[Attorney-General]]) prosecuting, and [[James Cassels (politician)|J. D. Cassels]] defending. The defence were unable to challenge the evidence given by Spilsbury since the bruise on Mrs Fox's larynx had disappeared due to decomposition by the time their experts had examined it. Jowitt subjected Fox to a ferocious cross-examination, and Fox's excuse that he had closed his mother's door &quot;so that smoke should not spread into the hotel&quot; appeared to be cowardly. The jury therefore convicted Fox and he was hanged at [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Jail]] on 8 April 1930, the [[Home Secretary]] having declined to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 April 1930 |page=9 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19300407.2.62 |title=Margate Matricide: Death Sentence to Stand |newspaper=[[Evening Post (London)|Evening Post]] |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassels later remarked that Fox might have saved himself by answering &quot;I don't know&quot; to Jowitt's question &quot;why did you shut the door?&quot;

==Dramatisations==
Around 1948, the radio series &quot;Secrets of Scotland Yard&quot; dramatised the story under the title &quot;Smoke Clings to the Hair&quot;.

The case was dramatised as &quot;Murder at The Metropole&quot; in 1976 as part of the &quot;Killers&quot; television series; Fox was played by [[Christopher Timothy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1336403/ |title=&quot;Killers&quot; Murder at the Metropole (TV episode 1976) |publisher=IMDb  |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later (1981) version, produced by [[Granada Television]] under the title &quot;Lady Killers: A Boy's Best Friend&quot;, starred [[Tim Brierley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b73656d29 |title=A Boy's Best Friend (1981) |publisher=BFI |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Robert George Henry James 'Flossie’ Forsyth''' was a British criminal who became one of the youngest prisoners to be executed in a British prison in the 20th century. He was just 18 years old when he was hanged at [[HMP Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] Prison by [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]] (assisted by Royston Rickard) on 10 November 1960 for the murder of Allan Edward John Jee on 25 June 1960.

One of his accomplices, 23-year-old Norman James 'Flash' Harris, was executed at [[HMP Pentonville|Pentonville]] Prison on the same morning by [[Robert Leslie Stewart]] (assisted by H. F. Robinson).

==The murder==

Forsyth, a road worker, and Harris, an unemployed driver, were part of a gang which also included Christopher Louis Darby (aged 20, a coalman) and Terence Lutt (aged 17, an unemployed labourer). On the night of 25 June 1960, at about 11.17 p.m., they set upon 23-year-old engineer Allan Jee on a footpath at the bottom of James Street, [[Hounslow]], Middlesex, kicking him unconscious while attempting to relieve him of his money (a ten-shilling note which was all the money Jee had on him was missed) and leaving him bleeding from head injuries. Jee, who had been walking home after an evening with his fiancée, Jacqueline Herbert, was about 20 yards from his home when he was attacked; he had become engaged on the previous day. He suffered a fractured skull during the attack and died from his injuries two days later at the West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, having suffered a cerebral contusion.

A witness, Anthony Cowell, who was standing at the other end of James Street, was able to give police a detailed description of four young men running from the scene of the crime; it was a friend of Forsyth's, Kevin Cullinan, who informed the police on 18 July 1960 that Forsyth had been boasting about his part in the attack. Furthermore, he gave the police the names of three young men - Harris, Darby and Lutt - whom he had seen with Forsyth in a coffee bar on the night of the attack. The four young men were arrested two days later; in the course of the police investigation into the murder, traces of Jee’s blood were found on Forsyth’s ‘winkle-picker’ shoes and trousers.

At the time of the murder, Forsyth was on bail for having assaulted two police officers at Heathrow Airport and had been detained in an Approved School.

==The trial==

It became clear at the subsequent trial at the [[Old Bailey]] that Lutt had been the one to strike the first blow upon Jee but that the kicking had been administered by Forsyth. Only Darby claimed to have used no violence upon Jee; for that reason, the charge against him was reduced to one of non-capital murder.

Pathologist Dr. Donald Teare testified that Jee had been kicked five times in the head by the gang.

Three of the gang - Forsyth, Harris and Lutt - were found guilty of capital murder. Both Forsyth and Harris were sentenced to death by [[Rodger Winn|Mr Justice Winn]] on 26 September 1960 under the [[Homicide Act 1957|1957 Homicide Act]], which defined murder in the course of robbery as a capital crime (although nothing had actually been taken in the course of the assault). As a minor, Lutt was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure (he would serve 10 years), while Darby was found guilty of non-capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Execution==

The appeals of both Forsyth and Harris were dismissed in October 1960. A petition for clemency containing around 3,000 names, including such prominent names as [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|The Earl of Harewood]], [[Gilbert Harding]], [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], was turned down on 8 November 1960. The executions took place two days later, at 9 a. m.. Forsyth was given a ’drop’ of seven feet and two inches.

Forsyth – whose girlfriend Margaret Caitlin (he claimed) was expecting his child in January 1961 - was the last 18-year-old to be hanged in Britain (the last teenager to be executed in Britain - 19-year-old [[Anthony Miller (murderer)|Anthony Miller]] - was hanged in Glasgow just over a month later, on 22 December 1960). Only three other eighteen-year-olds were executed in Britain in the 20th century (Henry Julius Jacoby in 1922, Arthur Bishop in 1925 and German POW Armin Kuhne in 1945); the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933|Children and Young Persons Act of 1933]] fixed the minimum age for a prisoner to be hanged at 18 years.

On the morning of 10 November, 20-year-old Victor Terry, a friend of Forsyth's, heard about the executions on his car radio. One hour later, he shot dead a security guard at a bank in [[Worthing]], West Sussex in the course of a robbery. Terry was to claim at his subsequent trial that he was possessed by the spirit of the American gangster [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|'Legs' Diamond]]. He was found guilty of capital murder and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 25 May 1961, on the same gallows upon which Forsyth had been executed just over six months earlier.

'''Willie Francis''' (January 12, 1929 – May 9, 1947) is best known for surviving a failed execution by [[electric chair|electrocution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;strange_case&quot;/&gt;  He was a black juvenile offender [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] at age 16 by the [[Louisiana|state of Louisiana]] in 1945 for having murdered Andrew Thomas, a Cajun pharmacy owner in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] who had once employed him. He was 17 when he survived the first attempt to execute him, as the chair malfunctioned. After an appeal of his case taken to the [[US Supreme Court]] failed, he was executed in 1947 at age 18.

== Arrest and trial ==
In 1944 Andrew Thomas, a pharmacist in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]], was shot and killed. His murder remained unsolved for nine months; in August 1945 Willie Francis was detained in Texas due to his proximity to an unrelated crime. Police found that he was carrying Thomas's wallet in his pocket.

Francis initially named several others in connection with the murder, but the police dismissed these claims. A short time later under interrogation, Francis confessed to Thomas's murder, writing, &quot;It was a secret about me and him.&quot;  He had no counsel with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt; The meaning of his statement is still uncertain. Author [[Gilbert King (author)|Gilbert King]], in his book, ''The Execution of Willie Francis'' (2008), alludes to rumors in St. Martinville of sexual abuse of the youth by the pharmacist. Francis later directed the police to where he had disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon. The gun used to kill Thomas was found near the crime scene. It belonged to a deputy sheriff in St. Martinville who had once threatened to kill Thomas. The gun, and the bullets recovered from the crime scene and Thomas' body, disappeared from police evidence just before the trial.

Despite two separate written confessions, Francis pleaded not guilty. During his trial, the court-appointed defense attorneys offered no objections, called no witnesses, and put up no defense.  The validity of Francis' confessions were not questioned by the defense, although he had no counsel at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/18/AR2006071801376.html Gilbert King, &quot;The Two Executions Of Willie Francis&quot;], ''Washington Post'', 19 July 2006, accessed 28 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the trial began, Francis was quickly convicted of murder and was sentenced to death by twelve jurors and the judge despite his having been underage at 15 at the time of the crime. As Louisiana had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] nearly all blacks at the turn of the century by its new state constitution, the jury was all-white (only voters could serve).

== Execution attempt, appeal, and second execution ==
On May 3, 1946, Francis survived an attempt at execution by the [[electric chair]]. Witnesses reported hearing the teenager scream from behind the leather hood, &quot;Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe!&quot; as the supposedly lethal surge of electricity was being applied.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0329_0459_ZD.html|title=Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber dissent|author=Justice Harold Burton|accessdate=2009-06-10|authorlink=Harold Hitz Burton}} Justice Burton cited an affidavit by Harold Resweber, witness to the botched execution, which reported Francis' outburst.&lt;/ref&gt; The portable electric chair, known as &quot;[[Gruesome Gertie]],&quot; was found to have been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate from the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] at Angola. The sheriff, E.L. Resweber, was later quoted as saying: &quot;This boy really got a shock when they turned that machine on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dissent&quot;/&gt;

After the botched execution, a young lawyer, Bertrand DeBlanc decided to take Francis' case. He felt it was unjust, and cruel and unusual punishment, as prohibited in the Constitution, to subject him again to the execution process. DeBlanc had been best friends with Thomas and his decision was greeted with dismay by whites in the small Cajun town.  DeBlanc took Francis' case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Francis v. Resweber]]'', 329 U.S. 459 (1947), citing various violations of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendment rights. These included violations of [[equal protection]], [[double jeopardy]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].

The preliminary vote was in Francis' favor. A court clerk mistakenly informed Francis' legal team he had won his appeal. The US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, rejected the appeal. The dissenting opinion asked how many attempted executions were needed before this was deemed cruel and unusual punishment. Behind the scenes, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], who cast the deciding vote to execute Francis, asked his old college roommate to secretly petition [[Jimmie H. Davis|the Governor of Louisiana]] for a [[commutation of sentence|commutation]], which failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;st_peter_times&quot;/&gt;

Subsequently, Willie Francis was returned to the electric chair on May 9, 1947. He told reporter Elliott Chaze a couple of days before the execution that he was going to meet the Lord with his &quot;Sunday pants and Sunday heart.&quot; He was pronounced dead in the chair at 12:10 pm ([[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CST]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;st_peter_times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Trip To Chair-Willie Francis Dies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rMEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1k4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2776,3328274&amp;dq=willie+francis|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|author=Elliott Chaze|date=May 10, 1947|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
Willie Francis' short life was the subject of a 2006 documentary, titled ''Willie Francis Must Die Again,'' written and directed by filmmaker [[Allan Durand]]. The film, narrated by actor [[Danny Glover]], chronicles the full story of his case and the unprecedented court battle that followed his failed execution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">'''Francisco''' (died 28 April 1876) was the last person who was [[capital punishment in Brazil|executed]] by [[Brazil]]. A black slave, he was hanged for the murder of his masters.

In 1874, Francisco and two other slaves, Prudencio and Vicente, were arrested for having beat to death their masters, João Evangelista de Lima and his wife Josepha Marta de Lima. The crime was committed in [[Pilar, Alagoas]]. Francisco and Prudencio fled to [[Pesqueira, Pernambuco|Pesqueira]]; in a confrontation with police, Prudencio was killed and Francisco was captured. Vicente had fled to [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Marechal Deodoro]], where he was captured.

At Francisco and Vicente's trial, they were both found guilty of the murders. Francisco was sentenced to death by hanging and Vicente was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Both appealed to [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]] for clemency; Francisco's appeal was denied and the emperor did not respond to Vicente's. Vicente later died in prison.

Francisco's execution was carried out in Pilar on 28 April 1876. It was the last executions carried out by Brazil.

Since 2000, an annual re-enactment of Francisco's last hours has been held in Pilar on 28 April. In part, the re-enactment is intended to celebrate the abolition of the death penalty in Brazil.

Frazier and co-defendant [[Jermaine Herron]] were found guilty of the 1997 murder of Betsy Nutt and her 15-year-old son after asking to use her telephone, claiming that their truck had broken down. Herron was executed on 17 May 2006. Frazier maintained his innocence up until his execution.

His last words before the execution were: &quot;Yes I do.  Debbie, my Baby, I love you; do you know I love you.  You are my life.  You are my wife - always stay strong.  Stay strong everybody.  I am innocent.  I am being punished for a crime I did not commit.  I have professed my innocence for nine years, and I continue to say I am innocent.  Let my people know I love them.  We must continue on.  Do not give up the fight; do not give up hope for a better future.  Because we can make it happen.  I love you, I love my son, and I love my daughter.  Bruno, Chuckie, Juanita, Ray - I love you, all of you.  Stay strong baby.  I love you forever. &quot;

'''James D. French''' (ca. 1936 – 10 August 1966) was an [[United States|American]] criminal who was the last person [[execution|executed]] under [[Oklahoma]]'s  [[death penalty]] laws prior to ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', which suspended [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment in America]] from 1972 until 1976. He was also the only prisoner executed in the United States that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Staff report.

'''Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; Friery''' (February 1843 or 1844 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1866) was a [[New York City]] criminal and independent gang leader during the 1850s and 1860s. Along with five or six others, he entered the [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|East Houston Street]] [[Western saloon|saloon]] of Henry Lazarus on the morning of January 3, 1865. One of the men, California Jack, offered a wager of $100 challenging anyone in the bar to a fight with one of the gang members. When no one responded to their offer, California Jack offered $10 to any man who could take the owner Henry Lazarus's pistol away from him. Having no pistol on him, Lazarus declined their offer. 

Friery then walked toward Lazarus offering to shake his hand and, when he refused, stabbed the saloon owner in the throat with a [[dirk]], killing him instantly. Arrested soon after, he appeared before Judge Abraham D. Russell at the Court of General Sessions and convicted of first degree murder on February 17, 1865. Sentenced to death, he was executed by [[hanging]] on August 17, 1866 at the age of 22.
