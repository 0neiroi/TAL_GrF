'''Francis T. &quot;Mickey&quot; Featherstone''' (born June 3, 1949) is a former [[Irish Mob|Irish American mobster]] and member of [[the Westies]], an [[organized crime]] syndicate from [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], led by [[James Coonan]]. Featherstone committed several mob killings before he was convicted in 1986 of a murder he had not committed. Facing a quarter of a century in jail, he became an informant and brought down Coonan's gang.

==Early life==
Featherstone was born on West 43rd St.,&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; one of nine children.&lt;ref name=ghosts&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oucCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|title=The Ghosts of Hell's Kitchen|last=Daly|first=Michael|author2=John Hamill|date=12 April 1982|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother helped with the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and his father was a customs officer.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He had blond hair and was often said to be baby-faced.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served in the [[Vietnam War]] as member of the [[Green Berets]] aged just 17 after lying about his age.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served as a stock clerk.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-thoroughly-vicious-gang.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Books of The Times; The Rise and Fall of a Thoroughly Vicious Gang|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|date=16 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his disappointment, he did not see combat, although he was circumcised by his friends in a drunken prank.&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=stories&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/books/new-york-stories-hell-s-kitchen-killers.html|title=New York Stories: Hell's Kitchen Killers|last=Bain|first=David Haward|date=8 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[military discharge|medical discharge]] in 1967 after just a year, claiming to have hallucinations.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==Return to Hell's Kitchen==
When a group from New Jersey entered Hell's Kitchen and a fight started with the outsiders, Featherstone returned with a rifle and shot one of them in the side, for which he was arrested and probationed.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He shot dead Linwood Willis in a confrontation outside a bar in 1971, but was found not guilty due to insanity.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He spent time in a series of [[mental hospitals]], being released in 1975. He would act out frequently while in the hospitals, leading to him being restrained and injected with [[thorazine]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He began spending time in saloons like Club 596 and Sunbrite that were hangouts for the Westies.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==The Westies==
Featherstone's penchant for violence and intimidation caught the eye of Coonan and Featherstone became Coonan's right-hand man by 1976.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; [[Mickey Spillane (mobster)|Mickey Spillane]], the mob leader in Hell's Kitchen at the time, was shot five times outside his apartment in August 1977, and Featherstone was arrested but acquitted for his killing.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; The police suspected him of a series of mob [[contract killing]]s. He went on trial with Coonan for the killing of a barman, but they were acquitted in December 1979 after one witness killed himself and another refused to testify.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He was finally jailed after using fake currency at a massage parlor - he was traced because the girl remembered seeing his name tattooed on his forearm. Featherstone did time in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield Missouri on the psychiatric ward in 1982. He was a model prisoner, seen daily picking fine lint off of his perfectly made bunk to pass inspection, and starting arguments with others for not polishing their door frame brass. The institution kept Featherstone working on the ward, out of General Population, for his own safety. In February 1982, he was sentenced to six years in jail for counterfeiting.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

Featherstone and Coonan had a falling out over the latter's alliance with the [[Gambino crime family]], which Featherstone saw as a betrayal of all the Irish-Americans in Hell's Kitchen.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt;

===Turning informer===
Featherstone was convicted in March 1986 for the April 1985 murder of Michael Holly, despite being innocent of this particular murder, which was a revenge attack probably carried out by another of the Westies, [[Billy Bokun]].&lt;ref name=lords&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/magazine/the-lord-s-of-hell-s-kitchen.html?src=pm|title=The Lords of Hell's Kitchen|last=Traub|first=James|date=5 April 1987|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked at receiving his sentence of 25 years in jail, and concluded that he had been framed by his own gang.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; Rather than serving his sentence he instead told prosecutors that Bokun had committed the murder, and he became an [[informant]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=informed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/01/nyregion/admitted-westies-killer-who-informed-is-free.html|title=Admitted Westies Killer Who Informed Is Free|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|date=1 January 1989|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Sissy co-operated with the District Attorney's office to tape incriminating conversations with gang members, including Bokun.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; In September 1986, Judge [[Alvin Schlesinger]] overturned Featherstone's conviction.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; His testimony at Coonan's racketeering trial during 1987-8 helped to bring down Coonan's gang.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; He pleaded guilty to a [[racketeering]] charge and received a suspended sentence of five years probation from Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] due to his cooperation with the authorities.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; He was freed in December 1988&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; and went into a [[witness protection]] program.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt;

'''Raymond Martinez Fernandez''' (December 17, 1914 &amp;ndash; March 8, 1951) and '''Martha Jule Beck''' (May 6, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 8, 1951) were an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] couple. They are believed to have killed as many as 20 women during their murderous spree between 1947 and 1949. After their arrest and trial for [[serial murder]] in 1949, they became known as &quot;'''[[Lonely hearts killer|The Lonely Hearts Killers]]'''&quot; for meeting their unsuspecting victims through [[Personal ads|lonely hearts ads]]. A number of films and television shows are based on this case.

==Prior to the murders==

===Raymond Fernandez===
Raymond Martinez Fernandez was born on December 17, 1914 in Hawaii to [[Spanish people|Spanish]] parents. Shortly thereafter, they moved to [[Connecticut]]. As an adult, he moved to [[Spain]], married, and had four children, all of whom he abandoned later on in life.

After serving in Spain's Merchant Marine and then [[British Intelligence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 4)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/4.html |title=The Lonely Hearts Killers|publisher= Trutv.com|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[World War II]], Fernandez decided to seek work. Shortly after boarding a ship bound for America, a steel hatch fell on top of him, fracturing his skull and [[Frontal lobe injury|injuring]] his [[frontal lobe]]. The damage caused by this injury may well have affected his social and sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=Levin|title=Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography in relation to the neurobehavioral sequelae of mild and moderate head injuries| work=Journal of Neurosurgery|date= 1987|volume= 66|pages= 706–713|doi=10.3171/jns.1987.66.5.0706|display-authors=etal|pmid=3572497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his release from a hospital, Fernandez stole some clothing and was subsequently imprisoned for a year, during which time his cellmate taught him [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] and [[black magic]]. He later claimed black magic gave him irresistible power and charm over women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serial Killers Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francesfarmersrevenge.com/stuff/serialkillers/marthabeck.htm |title=Serial Killers Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez |publisher=Francesfarmersrevenge.com |date=March 8, 1951 |accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/1.html|title=The Lonely Hearts Killers|publisher=Trutv.com|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martha Beck===
Martha Beck was born '''Martha Jule Seabrook''' on May 6, 1920 in [[Milton, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GS%7Cn=beck&amp;GSfn=martha&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GSsr=161&amp;GRid=27327468&amp;df=all&amp; |website=Find-a-Grave|title= Martha Jule Seabrook Beck |accessdate= February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly due to a [[gland]]ular problem (then a common explanation for obesity), she was [[overweight]] and underwent [[premature puberty|puberty prematurely]].  At her trial, she claimed to have been [[Child sexual abuse|sexually assaulted]] by her brother. When she told her mother what happened, her mother beat her, claiming Martha was responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/2.html|title= The Lonely Hearts Killers|publisher= Trutv.com|page =2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teen, Beck ran away from home.

After Martha finished school, she studied nursing but had trouble finding a job due to her weight. She initially became an [[undertaker]]'s assistant and prepared female bodies for burial. She then quit that job and moved to California, where she worked in an Army hospital as a nurse. She engaged in sexually promiscuous behavior and eventually became [[pregnant]]. She tried to convince the father to marry her, but he refused. Single and pregnant, she returned to Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;/&gt;

Martha told people the father was a serviceman she had married, later claiming he had been killed in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]]. The town mourned her loss, and the story was published in the local newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 2)&quot;/&gt; Shortly after her daughter was born, she became pregnant again by a [[Pensacola]] bus driver named Alfred Beck. They married quickly and [[divorce]]d six months thereafter, and she gave birth to a son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 3)&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/partners/fernandez/3.html |title=The Lonely Hearts Killers| publisher=Trutv.com| page =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployed and the single mother of two young children, Beck escaped into a [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] world, buying romance magazines and [[romance novel|novel]]s, and watching romantic movies. In 1946, she found employment at the Pensacola Hospital for Children. She placed a lonely hearts ad in 1947, which Raymond Fernandez answered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martha Beck &amp; Raymond Hernandez, Lonely Hearts Killers -- The Crime Library (page 3)&quot;/&gt;

==Murders==
Fernandez visited Beck and stayed for a short time; she told everyone they were to be married. He returned to [[New York City]] while she made preparations in [[Milton, Florida]], where she lived. When she was abruptly fired from her job, she packed up and arrived on his doorstep in New York. Fernandez enjoyed the way she catered to his every whim, and when he learned she had left her children for him, he thought it was a sign of an unconditional love. He confessed his criminal enterprises to Beck, who quickly sent her children to the [[Salvation Army]] in order to assist Fernandez without hindrances. She posed as Fernandez's sister, giving him an air of respectability. Their victims, feeling more secure knowing there was another woman in the house, often agreed to stay with the pair. Beck also convinced some victims that she lived alone and that her &quot;brother&quot; was only a guest. Beck was extremely jealous and would go to great lengths to make sure Fernandez and his &quot;intended&quot; never consummated their relationship. When he did have sex with a woman, Beck subjected both to her violent temper.

In 1949, the pair committed the three murders for which they would later be convicted. Janet Fay, 66, became engaged to Fernandez and went to stay at his [[Long Island]] apartment. When Beck caught her in bed with Fernandez, she smashed Fay's head in with a hammer in a murderous rage. Fernandez then strangled Fay. Fay's family became suspicious when she disappeared, and Fernandez and Beck fled.

Beck and Fernandez traveled to Byron Center Road in [[Wyoming, Michigan|Wyoming Township, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave her sleeping pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor and began to cry, which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if she saw her bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police to arrive at the door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gado&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gado|first=Mark|title=
Death Row Women: Murder, Justice, and the New York Press|year=2007|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0275993612|pages=157.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and executions==
Fernandez quickly confessed, with the understanding that they would not be [[extradition|extradited]] to New York; [[Michigan]] had no [[death penalty]], but New York did. They were, nonetheless, extradited. The pair vehemently denied committing 17 murders that were attributed to them, and Fernandez tried to retract his confession, saying he made it only to protect Beck.

Their trial was sensationalized, with lurid tales of sexual perversity.  Newspaper reporters described Beck's appearance with derision, and she wrote protesting letters to the editors. Fernandez and Beck were convicted of Janet Fay's murder—the only one for which they were tried—and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. On March 8, 1951, both were executed by [[Joseph Francel]]&lt;ref&gt;Murderpedia: [http://murderpedia.org/male.F/f/fernandez-raymond.htm Raymond Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murderpedia: [http://murderpedia.org/female.B/b/beck-martha.htm Martha Beck]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[electric chair]].

Despite their tumultuous arguments and relationship problems, they often professed their love to each other, as demonstrated by their official last words:

&quot;I wanna shout it out; I love Martha! What do the public know about love?&quot; - Raymond Fernandez.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuchs&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuchs|first=Christian|title=Bad Blood|year=1996|publisher=Creation Books|isbn=1-84068-025-3|pages=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;My story is a love story. But only those tortured by love can know what I mean. I am not unfeeling, stupid or moronic. I am a woman who had a great love and always will have it. Imprisonment in the Death House has only strengthened my feeling for Raymond.&quot; - Martha Beck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuchs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Jay Robert (1986): ''Look for the Woman''. Rowman &amp; Littlefied, 408 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pedro Rodrigues Filho''' (born 17 June 1954 in [[Santa Rita do Sapucaí]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[serial killer]]. Nicknamed '''Pedrinho Matador''' (Killer Petey) and arrested in 1973, in 2003 he was convicted of murdering at least 71 people and sentenced to 128 years in prison.

== Biography ==
Pedro Rodrigues Filho was born on a farm in [[Santa Rita do Sapucaí]], southern [[Minas Gerais]] state, with an injured [[human skull|skull]], the result of beatings his father had inflicted upon his mother's womb during a fight. Filho said his first urge to kill happened at the age of 13. During a fight with an older cousin, he pushed the boy into a sugar cane press. The boy almost died.

At the age of 14, he murdered the vice-Mayor of [[Alfenas]], [[Minas Gerais]], because he fired his father, a school guard, at the time accused of stealing the school kitchen's food. Then he murdered another guard, supposedly the real thief.

He took refuge in [[Mogi das Cruzes]], São Paulo, where he began a series of burglaries and murdered a drug dealer. There he also met Maria Aparecida Olympia, a woman he then lived with. They lived together until she was killed by some gang members. Filho escaped. In search of revenge for her death, he murdered and tortured several people in an attempt to find out the identity of the gangster who killed Olympia.
Before he was 18 years old he had already left a trail of 10 bodies and several injured.

Still in Mogi das Cruzes, he executed his own father at a local prison, after his father butchered his mother with a [[machete]]. To get revenge, Filho killed his father, cut out a piece of his heart, chewed it, and threw it away.

Filho was first arrested on May 24, 1973. He was sentenced to prison and killed at least 4 inmates while incarcerated. He later claimed a total of 100 victims. His total confirmed victims are 71, including his father. In 2003, he was sentenced to 128 years in prison, although Brazilian law system prohibits anyone from spending more than 30 years behind bars. But due to the crimes he committed inside the prison, his sentence was changed to over 400 years in prison. However, he was set to be released by the Justice System in 2007, and after 34 years in prison, he was released on April 24, 2007. Information from the Brazilian National Security Force Intel indicates that he went to Brazilian north-east, more precisely, to [[Fortaleza]] in Ceará.
On September 15, 2011, local media from Santa Catarina published that Filho had been arrested at his home, in the rural area, where he worked as a house-keeper, at Balneário Camboriú, Santa Catarina coastline. According to a news channel, he will serve time for accusations such as riot and false imprisonment.

Besides the number of killings, Filho became notorious in Brazil for promising the murder of other criminals, such as [[Francisco de Assis Pereira]], a.k.a. The Park Maniac, another [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;u=http://www.reclamando.com.br/%3Faction%3Dread%26eid%3D295%26id%3D879%26system%3Dnews&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Pedrinho%2BMatador%2522%26start%3D50%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1T4ADBF_enCA238CA238%26sa%3DN &quot;What the science has discovered about the coldest of criminals – the psychopath&quot;] (translated from Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atalay Filiz''' is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[serial killer]] suspect. He is held responsible for at least three murders, possibly for one in 2012, two in September 2013 and one in May 2016. A fugitive for more than two years, he was captured in June 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
Atalay Filiz was born to an officer of the [[Turkish Air Force]]. His father retired from the military, and entered a career as a pilot at the [[Turkish Airlines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

He was educated at [[Galatasaray High School]] , one of the most prominent high schools of Turkey, in [[Istanbul]], and graduated with honors. His teachers remark that &quot;he is so intelligent that he could survive in a jungle when left alone.&quot; In college, Filiz studied biology in the [[University of Paris-Sud]] in [[France]]. In 2010, he came back Turkey and said his family he will study for his doctorate in Ankara. However, after the allegations it is revealed that he was never registered for a doctorate degree in Ankara &lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;

==Murders==
He is accused of murdering in 2013 two people, whom he knew from his time in [[Paris]], France. On September 16, Filiz allegedly ambushed and killed Göktuğ Demirarslan, the 24-year-old son of [[Air vice-marshal]] Hasan Hüseyin Demirarslan, and his 23-year old Russian girlfriend Elena Radchikova ({{lang-ru|Елена Радчикова}}) with a [[pump action shotgun]] in front of the entrance of their housing estate in [[Eryaman, Etimesgut]] after secretly pursuing them two weeks long.&lt;ref name=&quot;sc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;h2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He is to said to have escaped, and was ascertained that he flew to Greece with a fake identity. To another police information, he went to Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt; To seek his location and to arrest him, an Interpol red notice was issued. It was believed that he later returned to Turkey with his fake identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

On May 27, 2016, he allegedly murdered the 40-year old Fatma Kayıkçı, a history teacher and mother of two,&lt;ref name=&quot;h2&quot;/&gt; the spouse of his boss Gani Kayıkçı.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He was staying under the alias Furkan Altın in the ground floor flat of the apartment building, where also the family Kayıkçı lived. She was about to leave the building to pickup her child from the school. Filiz allegedly stabbed her, put her body in a wheeled luggage in his flat, took it outside, as seen on a [[closed-circuit television|surveillance footage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hdn1&quot;/&gt; He dumped her body at the bottom of a tree in an open terrain nearby. The neighbors in the apartment building heard screams. One of her shoes and bloodstains led to Filiz' flat.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt; Police identified Furkan Altın as Atalay Filiz from the fingerprints in the crime scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;  The victim's body was found the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1&quot;/&gt;

It is now believed that he also murdered in Paris his Russian girlfriend Olga Seregina ({{lang-ru|Ольга Серегина}}), who had introduced her friend Radchikova to Demirarslan during their stay in Paris. She had mysteriously vanished in 2011. An [[Interpol notice]] in the form of a yellow notice was issued at that time to locate the missing woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;/&gt;

Filiz was captured and arrested by police in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016 upon information of a citizen in [[Menderes, İzmir]], western Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;

Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known [[homicide]], and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the [[kidnapping]] and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by [[electric chair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wife&quot; /&gt; His crimes were dramatised in [[The Gray Man (2007 film)|The Gray Man]], starring [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Fish.

==Early life==

===Birth and childhood===
Fish was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on May 19, 1870, to Randall (1795&amp;nbsp;– October 16, 1875) and Ellen (née Howell; 1838–c. 1903&lt;ref&gt;Sing Sing Prison's receiving blotter indicates Fish was 33 when his mother died. Available on Ancestry.com under Albert H. Fish.&lt;/ref&gt;) Fish. His father was American, of English ancestry, and his mother was [[Scots-Irish American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/fish.html |title=Ancestry of Albert Fish |website=wargs.com |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner|date= |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was 43 years older than his mother&lt;ref name=1870census&gt;
Media:1870 census Fish.jpg|Albert Fish in the [[1870 US Census]] for [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and 75 years old at the time of his birth. Fish was the youngest child and had three living siblings: Walter, Annie, and Edwin. He wished to be known as &quot;Albert&quot; [[Necronym|after a dead sibling]] and to escape the nickname &quot;Ham &amp; Eggs&quot; that he was given at an [[orphanage]] in which he spent much of his childhood.

Fish's family had a history of [[mental illness]]. His uncle suffered from [[mania]]. A brother was confined in a state [[mental hospital]]. His sister was diagnosed with a &quot;mental affliction&quot;. Three other relatives were diagnosed with mental illnesses, and his mother had &quot;aural and/or visual hallucinations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schechter |first=Harold |authorlink=Harold Schechter | year = 1990 | title =Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RtZBOBe5_dAC | isbn = 0-671-67875-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/fish/index.html |title=Albert Fish |accessdate=2008-12-16 |publisher=[[Crime Library]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216143933/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/fish/index.html| archivedate= 16 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was a river boat captain and, by 1870, was a fertilizer manufacturer.&lt;ref name=1870census/&gt; The elder Fish died in 1875 at the Sixth Street Station of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. The [[Congressional Cemetery]] records show that Randall died on October 16, 1875, and was buried on October 19, 1875, in grave R96/89. Fish's mother then put her son into Saint John's Orphanage in Washington, where he was frequently abused. He began to [[Sadomasochism|enjoy the physical pain]] that the beatings brought.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Colin |authorlink1=Colin Wilson |last2=Seaman |first2=Donald |title=The Serial Killers |year=2004 |publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojygGQAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=978-0-7535-1321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his time at the orphanage, Fish remarked, &quot;I was there 'til I was nearly nine, and that's where I got started wrong. We were unmercifully whipped. I saw boys doing many things they should not have done.&quot;

By 1880, his mother had a government job and was able to remove Fish from the orphanage. In 1882, at age 12, he began a relationship with a telegraph boy. The youth introduced Fish to such practices as [[urolagnia]] (drinking urine) and [[coprophagia]] (eating feces). Fish began visiting public baths where he could watch other boys undress and spent a great portion of his weekends on these visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot; /&gt; Throughout his life, he would write obscene letters to women whose names he acquired from [[classified advertising]] and [[Dating agency|matrimonial agencies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;

===1890–1918: Early adulthood and criminal history===
By 1890, Fish arrived in [[New York City]], and he said at that point he became a [[prostitute]] and began [[rape|raping]] young boys. In 1898, his mother arranged a marriage for him with a woman nine years his junior.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;berry-dee&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry-Dee|first1=Christopher|title=Cannibal Serial Killers: Profiles of Depraved Flesh-eating Murderers|date=2011|publisher=Ulysses Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=1569759022|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had six children: Albert, Anna, Gertrude, Eugene, John, and Henry Fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot;/&gt;

Throughout 1898, he worked as a house painter. He said he continued molesting children, mostly boys younger than age six. He later recounted an incident in which a male lover took him to a waxworks museum, where Fish was fascinated by a [[bisection]] of a [[penis]]. After that, he became obsessed with sexual mutilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;berry-dee&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=capo&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capo|first1=Fran|title=Myths and Mysteries of New York|date=2011|publisher=Morris Book Publishing, LLC|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=978-0-7627-6107-4|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1903, he was arrested for [[grand larceny]] and was sentenced to incarceration in [[Sing Sing]].
[[File:Pelvis of Albert Fish (X-ray).jpg|thumb|left|150px|X-ray of Fish's [[pelvis]] and [[perineum]], introduced as evidence at his trial, demonstrating more than two dozen [[self-embedding|self-embedded]] needles]]
Around 1910, while he was working in Wilmington, Delaware, Fish met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Kedden. He took Kedden to where he was staying, and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not Fish forced Kedden to do these things, but in his confession he implies that the man was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Kedden to &quot;an old farm house&quot;, where he began to torture him. The torture took place over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Kedden up and cut off half of his penis. &quot;I shall never forget his scream, or the look he gave me,&quot; Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Kedden, cut up his body, and take it home, but he feared the hot weather would draw attention to him; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a [[Vaseline]]-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Kedden goodbye, and left. &quot;Took first train I could get back home. Never heard what become of him, or tried to find out,&quot; Fish said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borowski|first1=John|title=Albert Fish: In His Own Words|date=September 5, 2014|publisher=Waterfront Productions|isbn=0692263756|page=314|url=http://www.amazon.com/Albert-Fish-His-Own-Words/dp/0692263756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1917, Fish's wife left him for John Straube, a handyman who boarded with the Fish family. Fish then had to raise his children as a [[single parent]]. After his arrest, Fish told a newspaper that when his wife left him, she took nearly every possession the family owned.&lt;ref name=&quot;prairieghosts.com&quot;&gt;Taylor, Troy.

He once wrapped himself in a [[carpet]], saying that he was following the instructions of [[John the Apostle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSK&quot; /&gt;

It was about this time that Fish began to indulge in [[self-harm]]. He would [[self-embedding|embed]] needles into his groin and abdomen.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt; After his arrest, [[X-rays]] revealed that Fish had at least 29 needles lodged in his [[human pelvis|pelvic]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt; He also hit himself repeatedly with a nail-studded paddle and inserted wool doused with lighter fluid into his anus and set it alight.&lt;ref name=&quot;prairieghosts.com&quot;/&gt; While he was never thought to have physically attacked or abused his children, he did encourage them and their friends to paddle his buttocks with the same nail-studded paddle he used to abuse himself. He soon developed a growing obsession with [[cannibalism]], often preparing himself a dinner consisting solely of raw meat and sometimes serving it to his children.

On July 11, 1924, Fish found eight-year-old Beatrice Kiel playing alone on her parents' [[Staten Island]] farm. He offered her money to come and help him look for [[rhubarb]]. She was about to leave the farm when her mother chased Fish away. Fish left but returned later to the Kiels' barn, where he tried to sleep but was discovered by Hans Kiel and forced to leave.

Shortly before his abduction of Grace Budd, Fish attempted to test his &quot;implements of Hell&quot; on a child he had been molesting named Cyril Quinn.

When they said that they had not, he invited them into his apartment for sandwiches.

===Murder of Grace Budd===
[[File:Grace budd.gif|thumb|right|150px|Grace Budd (1918–1928)]]
On May 25, 1928, Fish saw a classified advertisement in the Sunday edition of the ''[[New York World]]'' that read, &quot;Young man, 18, wishes position in country. Edward Budd, 406 West 15th Street.&quot; On May 28, 1928, Fish, then 58&amp;nbsp;years old, visited the Budd family in [[Manhattan]] under the pretense of hiring Edward; he later confessed that he planned to tie Edward up, mutilate him, and leave him to bleed to death. He introduced himself as Frank Howard, a farmer from [[Farmingdale, New York]]. Fish promised to hire Budd and his friend Willie, and said he would send for them in a few days. He failed to show up, but he sent a telegraph to the Budd family apologizing and set a later date. When Fish returned, he met Grace Budd. He apparently changed his intended victim from Edward Budd to Grace Budd and quickly made up a story about having to attend his niece's birthday party. He convinced the parents, Delia Flanagan and Albert Budd I, to let Grace accompany him to the party that evening. The elder Albert Budd was a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] for the [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|United States Equitable Life Assurance Society]]. Grace had a younger sister, Beatrice, two older brothers, Edward and George Budd, and a younger brother, Albert Budd II. Grace left with Fish that day but never returned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:1920 census Budd.jpg|Grace Budd]] in the [[1920 US Census]] for [[Manhattan]]{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;My dear Mrs Budd,

In 1894 a friend of mine shipped as a deck hand on the steamer Tacoma, Capt John Davis. They sailed from San Francisco to Hong Kong China. On arriving there he and two others went ashore and got drunk. When they returned the boat was gone. At that time there was a famine in China.
Meat of any kind was from $1 to 3 Dollars a pound. So great was the suffering among the very poor that all children under 12 were sold to the Butchers to be cut up and sold for food in order to keep others from starving. A boy or girl under 14 was not safe in the street. You could go in any shop
and ask for steak – chops – or stew meat. Part of the naked body of a boy or girl would be brought out and just what you wanted cut from it. A boy or girls behind which is the sweetest part of the body and sold as veal cutlet brought the highest price. John staid there so long he acquired a taste for human flesh. On his return to N.Y. he stole two boys one 7 one 11. Took them to his home stripped them naked tied them in a closet then burned everything they had on. Several times every day and night he spanked them – tortured them – to make their meat good and tender. First he killed the 11 yr old boy, because he had the fattest ass and of course the most meat on it. Every part of his body was cooked and eaten except Head – bones and guts. He was roasted in the oven, (all of his ass) boiled, broiled, fried, stewed. The little boy was next, went the same way. At that time I was living at 409 E 100 St, rear – right side. He told me so often how good human flesh was I made up my mind to taste it. On Sunday June the 3 – 1928 I called on you at 406 W 15 St. Brought you pot cheese – strawberries. We had lunch. Grace sat in my lap and kissed me. I made up my mind to eat her, on the pretense of taking her to a party. You said Yes she could go. I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked out. When we got there, I told her to remain outside. She picked wild flowers. I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off. I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them. When all was ready I went to the window and called her. Then I hid in a closet until she was in the room. When she saw me all naked she began to cry and tried to run down stairs. I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama. First I stripped her naked. How she did kick – bite and scratch. I choked her to death then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat to my rooms, cook and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9 days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her, though, I could of had I wished. She died a virgin.&quot;}}&lt;!-- Please don't correct his original spelling errors--&gt;

Police investigated the letter. The story concerning &quot;Capt. Davis&quot; and the &quot;famine&quot; in Hong Kong could not be verified. The part of the letter concerning the murder of Grace Budd, however, was found to be accurate in its description of the kidnapping and subsequent events, although it was impossible to confirm whether or not Fish had actually eaten parts of Grace's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;schechter&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Schechter | first = Harold | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Deranged: The Shocking True Story of America's Most Fiendish Killer! | publisher = Gallery Books | date = 1998 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;heimer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Heimer | first = Mel | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cannibal; The Case Of Albert Fish | publisher = Lyle Stuart | date = 1971 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;martingale&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Martingale | first = Moira | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cannibal Killers: The Impossible Monsters | publisher = Robert Hale Ltd | date = 1993 | location =  | pages = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capture====
The letter was delivered in an envelope that had a small [[hexagon]]al emblem with the letters &quot;N.Y.P.C.B.A.&quot; representing &quot;New York Private Chauffeur's Benevolent Association&quot;. A janitor at the company told the police he had taken some of the stationery home but left it at his rooming house at 200 East [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] when he moved out. The landlady of the rooming house said that Fish checked out of that room a few days earlier. She said that Fish's son sent him money and he asked her to hold his next check for him. William F. King was the chief investigator for the case. He waited outside the room until Fish returned. Fish agreed to go to headquarters for questioning, then brandished a razor blade. King disarmed Fish and took him to police headquarters. Fish made no attempt to deny the murder of Grace Budd, saying that he meant to go to the house to kill Edward Budd, Grace's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Fish supplied the following biographical information in captivity: &quot;I was born May 19, 1870, in [[Washington, D.C.]]. We lived on B Street, N.E., between Second and Third. My father was Captain Randall Fish, 32nd-degree [[Freemasonry|Mason]], and he is buried in the Grand Lodge grounds of the [[Congressional Cemetery]]. He was a [[Potomac River]] boat captain, running from D.C. to [[Marshall Hall, Maryland|Marshall Hall]], [[Virginia]] {{sic}}. My father dropped dead October 15, 1875, in the old [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Station]] where [[James A. Garfield|President Garfield]] was shot, and I was placed in St. John's Orphanage in Washington. I was there till I was nearly nine, and that's where I got started wrong. We were unmercifully whipped. I saw boys doing many things they should not have done. I sang in the choir from 1880 to 1884, [[soprano]], at St. John's. I came to New York. I was a good painter, interiors or anything. I got an apartment and brought my mother up from Washington. We lived at 76 West 101st Street, and that's where I met my wife. After our six children were born, she left me. She took all the furniture and didn't even leave a mattress for the children to sleep on. I'm still worried about my children, you'd think they'd come to visit their old dad in jail, but they haven't.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fish said it &quot;never even entered [his] head&quot; to [[rape]] the girl,&lt;ref name=&quot;SerialKillers&quot;&gt;Wilson, Colin and Donald Seaman. ''The Serial Killers''. Virgin Publishing Ltd. 2004. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; but he later claimed to his attorney that, while kneeling on Grace's chest and strangling her, he did have two involuntary ejaculations. This information was used at trial to make the claim the kidnapping was sexually motivated, thus avoiding any mention of cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Colin and Donald Seaman. ''The Serial Killers''. Virgin Publishing Ltd. 2004, page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes discovered after Fish's arrest==

===Francis McDonnell===
During the night of July 14, 1924, 9-year-old Francis McDonnell was reported missing by his parents. He failed to return home after playing catch with friends in the [[Port Richmond, Staten Island|Port Richmond]] neighborhood of [[Staten Island]]. A search was organized and his body was found—hanging by a tree—in a wooded area near his home. He had been sexually assaulted, then strangled with his suspenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; According to an autopsy, McDonnell had also suffered extensive lacerations to his legs and abdomen, and his left [[hamstring]] had almost entirely been stripped of its flesh. Fish refused to claim responsibility for this, although he later stated that he intended to castrate the boy but fled when he heard someone approaching the area.

McDonnell's friends told the police that he was taken by an elderly man with a gray mustache. A neighbor also told the police he observed the boy with a similar-looking man walking along a grassy path into the nearby woods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; Francis' mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day. She told the reporters, &quot;He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw his thick gray hair and his drooping gray mustache. Everything about him seemed faded and gray.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt;

This description resulted in the mysterious stranger becoming known as &quot;The Gray Man&quot;. The McDonnell murder remained unsolved until the murder of Grace Budd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt; When several eyewitnesses, among them the Staten Island farmer Hans Kiel, positively identified Albert Fish as the odd stranger seen around Port Richmond on the day of Francis McDonnell's disappearance, [[Richmond County, New York|Richmond County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Thomas J. Walsh (New York)|Thomas J. Walsh]] announced his intention to seek an indictment against Fish for the boy's murder. At first Fish denied the charges. It was only in March 1935, after the conclusion of his trial for the Budd murder and his confession to the killing of Billy Gaffney, that Fish confirmed to investigators that he also raped and murdered Francis McDonnell. When the McDonnell confession was made public, the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that the disclosure solidified Fish's reputation as &quot;the most vicious child-slayer in criminal history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot;/&gt;

===Billy Gaffney===
On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old brother were playing in the apartment hallway in [[Brooklyn]] with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later on the roof of the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said &quot;the [[bogeyman]] took him.&quot; Gaffney's body was never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Gaffney's parents were Edward and Elizabeth Gaffney.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, serial killer [[Peter Kudzinowski]] was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a [[Brooklyn]] [[tram|trolley]], saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the old man had been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the &quot;bogeyman&quot; matched Fish's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Charley Project'' page on [http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/g/gaffney_billy.html Billy Gaffney]. Retrieved January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Police matched the description of the child to Billy Gaffney. Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927 and that on the day of Billy Gaffney's disappearance he was working at a location a few miles away from where the boy was abducted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring03/Rawlins/fishvict.htm &quot; Albert Fish.&quot;] ''The Life of a Cannibal''.

Then I walked back and took trolley to 59 St. at 2 A.M. and walked home from there. Next day about 2 P.M., I took tools, a good heavy [[cat o' nine tails|cat-of-nine tails]]. Home made. Short handle. Cut one of my belts in half, slit these half in six strips about 8 in. long. I whipped his bare behind till the blood ran from his legs. I cut off his ears&amp;nbsp;– nose&amp;nbsp;– [[Glasgow smile|slit his mouth from ear to ear]]. Gouged out his eyes. He was dead then. I stuck the knife in his belly and held my mouth to his body and drank his blood. I picked up four old potato sacks and gathered a pile of stones. Then I cut him up. I had a grip with me. I put his nose, ears and a few slices of his belly in the grip. Then I cut him thru the middle of his body. Just below his belly button. Then thru his legs about 2 in. below his behind. I put this in my grip with a lot of paper. I cut off the head&amp;nbsp;– feet&amp;nbsp;– arms&amp;nbsp;– hands and the legs below the knee. This I put in sacks weighed with stones, tied the ends and threw them into the pools of slimy water you will see all along the road going to North Beach. Water is 3 to 4 ft. deep. They sank at once. I came home with my meat. I had the front of his body I liked best. His monkey and pee wees and a nice little fat behind to roast in the oven and eat. I made a stew out of his ears&amp;nbsp;– nose&amp;nbsp;– pieces of his face and belly. I put onions, carrots, turnips, celery, salt and pepper. It was good. Then I split the cheeks of his behind open, cut off his monkey and pee wees and washed them first. I put strips of bacon on each cheek of his behind and put in the oven. Then I picked 4 onions and when meat had roasted about 1/4 hr., I poured about a pint of water over it for gravy and put in the onions. At frequent intervals I basted his behind with a wooden spoon. So the meat would be nice and juicy. In about 2 hr., it was nice and brown, cooked thru. I never ate any roast turkey that tasted half as good as his sweet fat little behind did. I ate every bit of the meat in about four days. His little monkey was as sweet as a nut, but his pee-wees I could not chew. Threw them in the toilet.}}

Elizabeth Gaffney visited Fish in Sing Sing, accompanied by Detective King and two other men. She wanted to ask him about her son's death, but Fish refused to speak to her. Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone. After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.

==Trial and execution==
Albert Fish's trial for the murder of Grace Budd began on March 11, 1935, in [[White Plains, New York]]. Frederick P. Close presided as judge and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] Chief Assistant District Attorney Elbert F. Gallagher was prosecuting attorney. Fish's defense counsel was James Dempsey, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of [[Peekskill, New York]]. The trial lasted for 10 days. Fish pleaded [[insanity]], and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children. Several [[psychiatrist]]s testified about Fish's [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]], which included [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], [[Sadomasochism|masochism]], [[cunnilingus]], [[anilingus]], [[fellatio]], [[flagellation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[voyeurism]], [[piquerism]], [[cannibalism]], [[coprophagia]], [[Urolagnia|urophilia]], [[pedophilia]] and [[infibulation]]. Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a &quot;psychiatric phenomenon&quot; and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;

The defense's chief expert witness was [[Fredric Wertham]], a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly &quot;sacrificing&quot; a boy would be [[penance]] for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Wertham then detailed Fish's [[cannibalism]], which in his mind he associated with [[Communion rite|communion]]. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered &quot;He is insane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an &quot;insane knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fish Held Insane By Three Experts.

The first of four rebuttal witnesses was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue psychiatric hospital]], where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if coprophilia, urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not &quot;mentally sick&quot; and that these were common perversions that were &quot;socially perfectly alright&quot; and that Fish was &quot;no different from millions of other people&quot;, some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the &quot;very same&quot; perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at [[The Tombs]], Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, &quot;That is not masochism&quot;, as he was only &quot;punishing himself to get sexual gratification&quot;. The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but &quot;was a matter of taste&quot; and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt; Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--{{quotation|&quot;He went into his room and he had a little pair of trunks, brown trunks, that he put on. He put those on and came out into the front room, and he got down on his hands and knees, and he had a paint stick that he stirred paint with. ... He would give the stick to one of us, and then he would get down on his hands and knees and we would sit on his back, one at a time, with our back facing him, and then we would put up so many fingers, and he was to tell how many fingers we had up, and if he guessed right, which he never did, why, we weren't supposed to hit him. Sometimes, he would even say more fingers than we really had. And if he never guessed right, why, we would hit him as many fingers as we would have up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crimelibrary&quot; /&gt;}}--&gt;

None of the jurors doubted that Fish was insane, but ultimately, as one later explained, they felt he should be executed anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schechter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Gini Graham|title=American Murder: Volume 1: Homicide in the Early 20th Century|date=2007|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-999-77-3|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63Et0WJR_ooC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found him to be [[Sanity|sane]] and guilty, and the judge ordered the [[death sentence]]. Fish arrived at prison in March 1935, and was executed on January 16, 1936, in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing]]. He entered the chamber at 11:06&amp;nbsp;p.m. and was pronounced dead three minutes later.&lt;ref name=&quot;pay&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Albert Fish, 65, Pays Penalty at Sing Sing |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20717F93C58107A93C5A8178AD85F428385F9 |quote=Albert Fish, 65&amp;nbsp;years old, of 55 East 128th Street, Manhattan, a house painter who murdered Grace Budd, 6, after attacking her in a Westchester farmhouse in 1928, was put to death tonight in the electric chair at Sing Sing prison. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 17, 1936 |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in the Sing Sing Prison Cemetery. Fish is said to have helped the executioner position the electrodes on his body. His last words were reportedly, &quot;I don't even know why I'm here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt; According to one witness present, it took two jolts before Fish died, creating the rumor that the apparatus was short-circuited by the needles that Fish inserted into his body.&lt;ref name=&quot;SerialKillers&quot; /&gt; These rumors were later regarded as untrue, as Fish reportedly died in the same fashion and time frame as others in the electric chair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt;

At a meeting with reporters after the execution, Fish's lawyer James Dempsey revealed that he was in possession of his client's &quot;final statement&quot;. This amounted to several pages of hand-written notes that Fish apparently penned in the hours just prior to his death. When pressed by the assembled journalists to reveal the document's contents, Dempsey refused, stating, &quot;I will never show it to anyone. It was the most filthy string of obscenities that I have ever read.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Taylor 2004&quot;/&gt;

'''Stephen Joseph &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi''' (born  June 9, 1934) is an American [[gangster]] and close associate of [[Winter Hill Gang]] boss [[Whitey Bulger]]. Beginning in 1975, Flemmi was a top echelon informant for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Despite delivering a great deal of intelligence about the inner workings of the [[Patriarca crime family]], Flemmi's own criminal activities proved a public relations nightmare for the FBI. For this reason, he was prosecuted under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) and sentenced to a long term of incarceration.

==Early years==
Stephen Joseph Flemmi was the eldest of three sons born to [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrant Giovanni and Irish immigrant Mary Irene Flemmi. He was raised in the Orchard Park tenement located at 25 Ambrose Street in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]]. His father was a bricklayer and veteran of the [[Royal Italian Army]] during [[World War I]], and his mother was a full-time homemaker.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Flemmi enlisted in the Army in 1951 at the age of 17 and served two tours of duty in Korea with the [[187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hassett|first=George|url=http://www.crimemagazine.com/fbi-boston-hoover-lies-and-murder|title=The FBI in Boston: Hoover, Lies and Murder |publisher=''Crime Magazine''|date=May 13, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Silver Star]] and [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] medals for valor.&lt;ref name=Marino&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projectmarino.com/boston-underworld-timeline/winter-hill-enterpris/stephen-the-rifleman-flemmi/|title=Stephen &quot;The Rifleman&quot; Flemmi|work=Project Marino|archive-url=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20150629234940/http://projectmarino.com/boston-underworld-timeline/winter-hill-enterpris/stephen-the-rifleman-flemmi/ |archive-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with James J. Bulger==
[[File:FBI surveillance photograph of James J. Bulger (r.) and Stephen Flemmi (l.).jpg|thumb|FBI surveillance photograph of Flemmi (left) with Winter Hill Gang boss, [[James Joseph Bulger|James Bulger]] (right), probably in the 1980s]]

In 1967, [[James J. &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger]] was released from Federal prison after serving a nine-year sentence for robbing banks. After a few years of working as a janitor, he became an enforcer for South Boston mob boss [[Donald Killeen]]. After Killeen was murdered by an enforcer for the [[Mullen Gang]], Winter Hill Gang boss [[Howie Winter]] mediated the dispute between Bulger and the remaining Killeens and the Mullens, who were led by [[Patrick Nee]]. Winter soon chose Bulger as his man in South Boston. Shortly afterward, Bulger became partners with Flemmi.

At this time, the Boston FBI office tried to convince Bulger to become an informant, but he refused.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/07/26/businessman-says-bulger-stuck-shotgun-in-his-mouth/|title=Witness in Bulger case says reputed mob boss stuck shotgun in his mouth|work=Fox News|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulger allegedly told Flemmi that he knew his secret. Flemmi has insisted that he did not know at the time that Bulger was also an informant. [[Kevin Weeks]], however, insists that Flemmi's story is untrue. He considers it too much of a coincidence that Bulger became an informant a year after becoming Flemmi's partner. He has written off his belief that Flemmi had probably helped to build a Federal case against him. Weeks has said that Bulger was likely forced to choose between supplying information to the FBI or returning to prison.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt;

==Married life==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DeborahHussey.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's stepdaughter]] --&gt;
In the 1950s, Flemmi was married to an Irish-American woman named Jeanette, from whom he later became estranged. By 1980, he planned to divorce Jeanette to marry his longtime mistress, Marilyn DeSilva, but it is unknown whether he ever followed through with the legal actions. Throughout his life, Flemmi was engaged in clandestine affairs with several other women, including sisters Debra Davis and Michelle Davis, and Deborah Hussey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/11/whitey-bulger-s-women-inside-the-terror-and-glamor-of-his-ex-girlfriends.html|title=Whitey Bulger's Women: Inside the Terror and Glamor of His Ex-Girlfriends|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Flemmi met Debra Davis at a jewelry store, and the couple dated for more than seven years. In 1981, Bulger is said to have killed Davis because she knew that Flemmi was an informant.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/justice/massachusetts-bulger-trial/?hpt=hp_t3|title=Bulger pal on his cooperation with U.S.:  'I was dead either way' - CNN.com|author=Deborah Feyerick, CNN|date=25 July 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that Flemmi, Bulger, and Weeks lured her to the house at 799 East Third Street in South Boston and [[garrot]]ted her. Her body was then buried in the basement. According to [[Kevin Weeks]], {{quote|Stevie said he'd take care of the clothes and the teeth. He was all business, going about the task of removing cleaning up and pulling teeth. Even though he had a long term relationship with Debbie, this wasn't bothering him any more than it had bothered Jimmy. Stevie was actually enjoying it, the way he always enjoyed a good murder. Like a stockbroker going to work, he was just doing his job. Cold and relaxed, with no emotion or change in demeanor, he was performing a night's work. Whether he went out to meet one of his girlfriends or home to Marion, I have no idea. Later on, when I was alone with Jimmy, I asked him what this was all about. &quot;Who knows?&quot; he answered. &quot;She was bringing Blacks back to the house. She was doing drugs. Stevie was probably fucking her.&quot; I never asked again, but it was just kind of distasteful killing a woman. I can see killing guys. That's the life they chose, the life they're involved in, the life we all chose. But a woman was different. It wasn't a nice thing. Years later, it came out that Stevie was in fact having sex with Debbie. And she'd been his stepdaughter since she was three years old. Who knows if she knew anything else about him? But to kill a woman because she threatened to tell that you were fucking her didn't make any sense, no more than it did to kill a girlfriend because she wanted to leave you. According to Stevie testimony in a later trial, when it came out that he had been having sex with her daughter, Marion tossed his clothes out in the driveway and changed the locks to the house. She didn't know about the murder, but she knew about the sex. That didn't make any sense either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Brutal; My Life in Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob |first=Kevin |last=Weeks |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122–123}} }}

==Relationship with the FBI==
Rico first recruited Flemmi as an informant in 1965.

In 1997, shortly after ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' disclosed that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, former Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks met with Connolly, who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, &quot;The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|247}} According to Weeks, {{quote|As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of the information in the files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see that a lot of the reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|248}} }}

==Arrest and imprisonment==
In December 1994, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that several imprisoned Jewish-American bookmakers had agreed to testify to paying them [[protection money]]. As a result, sealed indictments had come from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the FBI was due to make arrests during the Christmas season. In response, Bulger fled Boston on December 23, 1994, accompanied by his [[common law wife]], Catherine Greig.

According to Kevin Weeks, {{quote|In 1993 and 1994, before the pinches came down, Jimmy and Stevie were traveling on the French and Italian Riviera. The two of them traveled all over Europe, sometimes separating for a while. Sometimes they took girls, sometimes just the two of them went. They would rent cars and travel all through Europe. It was more preparation than anything, getting ready for another life. They didn't ask me to go, not that I would have wanted to. Jimmy had prepared for the run for years. He'd established a whole other person, Thomas Baxter, with a complete ID and credit cards in that name. He'd even joined associations in Baxter's name, building an entire portfolio for the guy. He'd always said you had to be ready to take off on short notice. And he was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt;{{rp|215}} }}  Flemmi, however, chose to remain in Boston and was swiftly taken into custody and incarcerated at the [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]] House of Correction.

During the discovery phase, two of Flemmi's co-defendants, Boston mafiosi [[Frank Salemme]] and Bobby DeLuca, were listening to tape from a roving bug, which is normally authorized when the FBI has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place.  They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention that they should have told one of their informants to give &quot;a list of questions&quot; to the other wiseguys.  When their lawyer, Tony Cardinale, learned about this, he realized that the FBI had lied about the basis for a roving bug in order to protect an informant.  Suspecting that this was not the only occasion that this happened, Cardinale sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehr |first1=Dick |last2=O'Neill |first2=Gerard |title=Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the FBI, and a Devil's Deal |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |date=2000 |isbn=1-891620-40-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|288-289, 291-293}}

Eventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were revealed to be FBI informants.  Flemmi believed that as a result, he had protection from the FBI, but not immunity.  He initially planned to prove through his own testimony and that of others that he was being prosecuted for crimes that were effectively authorized by the FBI.  He believed that as a result, Judge [[Mark L. Wolf]] would have no choice but to throw out the entire indictment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|297-300}} Stephen's problem was that he  couldn't really come clean. Without immunity, he couldn't admit to killings he hadn't been charged  with. By the time Stephen took the stand, in August 1998, John Martorano had pleaded guilty and started outlining the details of almost twenty murders he'd committed. Many of his murders had been done at the direction of Bulger and Stephen, who had paid him more than $1 million during his years as a wanted fugitive between 1978 and 1995. To many questions about the murders Flemmi was involved in, he pleaded the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|313-316}}

However, by 2000, it was obvious this gambit had failed.  Out of desperation, he ordered Weeks to get in touch with retired state police lieutenant [[Richard J. Schneiderhan]], a lifelong friend who had been on Winter Hill's payroll for virtually his entire career, to leak information about several wiretaps investigators were monitoring in hopes of tracking down Bulger.  However, when Weeks reached a plea bargain a year later, he admitted Schneiderhan's role in the leak.  Schneiderhan was ultimately convicted of obstructing justice and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  In 2000, Flemmi's brother Michael, then a retired Boston Police officer, was arrested for moving an arsenal of more than 70 weapons from their mother's shed after learning that it was to be the target of a search warrant.  He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.  A year later, he pleaded guilty to selling a load of Stephen's stolen jewelry for $40,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|340-341}}

By 2003, Flemmi knew he was at the end of his tether.  Salemme, Weeks and several others had turned informer, and had disclosed enough information to send Flemmi to prison for life, and possibly send him to death.  In October, Flemmi pleaded guilty in [[U.S. District Court]] in Boston to 10 counts of murder.   He made the decision as a part of a deal to reduce the sentence for his brother, Michael Flemmi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehr&quot;/&gt;{{rp|341-342}}

==In popular culture==
Flemmi is portrayed by [[Rory Cochrane]] in the 2015 Whitey Bulger biopic ''[[Black Mass (film)|Black Mass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/09/23/black_mass_accuracy_what_s_fact_and_what_s_fiction_in_the_james_whitey_bulger.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Flemmi loosely inspired the character Mr. French, portrayed by [[Ray Winstone]], in the film ''[[The Departed]]''

'''Michel Fourniret''' (born 4 April 1942) is a convicted French [[serial killer]] who confessed in June and July 2004 to [[kidnapping]], [[rape|raping]] and murdering nine girls in a span of 14 years, from 1987 to 2001. He was also accused of 10 additional murders, nine in France and one in Belgium, and was found guilty of seven of these charges. The trials started on 27 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7311104.stm|title=French 'serial killer' on trial |publisher=BBC|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on 28 May. He is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ogre/Beast of the Ardennes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7423554.stm|publisher= BBC | date=28 May 2008 | title=The couple who 'hunted virgins'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourniret was arrested after a failed attempt to kidnap a Belgian girl in June 2003. His wife, Monique Olivier, exposed him after hearing the news of another child murderer's wife (Michelle Martin, wife of [[Marc Dutroux]]) being convicted.  Fourniret was charged with the [[child abduction|abduction]] of minors and [[sexual misconduct]], and has been in detention since June 2003 for the attempted [[kidnapping]] of a 14-year-old girl in 2000. Olivier was charged with one murder and for helping him with a further six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Campbell|date=23 March 2008|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=yes|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3602716.ece |title=Wife lured virgins for ‘Ogre of the Ardennes’ serial killer | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourniret buried at least two of his victims at his Sautou chateau near [[Donchery]] in the French Ardennes in the late 1980s. On 3 July 2004, a team of French and Belgian police recovered the bodies of two of Fourniret's victims near the chateau. Fourniret was sentenced to life in prison; Olivier was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 28 years.&lt;ref name=BBCsentence/&gt;

== Confessed murders ==
* '''Isabelle Laville''' –  a 17-year-old French girl. She disappeared in [[Auxerre]], on 11 December 1987 on her way home from school. Her skeletal remains were located at the bottom of a well in the country north of Auxerre in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closed Cases|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/located.html |publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate= 1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Farida Hellegouarch''' – the girlfriend of one of the members of the [[Gang des postiches]] (a gang of bank robbers), a former cellmate of Fourniret's. Fourniret killed her in 1988 to access the group's funds. He bought his castle in France with the money.
* '''Fabienne Leroy''' – a 20-year-old woman. She disappeared in 1988 in [[Châlons-en-Champagne]], and her body was later found in the nearby woods. Killed by a shot to the heart after attempts to inject air into her veins.
* '''Jeanne-Marie Desramault''' –  a 22-year-old French student. She disappeared in 1989 from the railway station of [[Charleville-Mézières]], and her body was recovered from the estate of Fourniret with his assistance.
* '''[[Elisabeth Brichet case|Elisabeth Brichet]]''' – a 12-year-old Belgian girl. She disappeared from [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in 1989 after playing with a friend. Her disappearance was long thought to be at the hands of [[Marc Dutroux]], until Fourniret led police to her burial site on his estate in France.
* '''Natacha Danais''' – a 13-year-old French girl, disappeared November 1990 in Nantes, western France whilst out shopping with her mother. Her body was found a few days later on a local beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 February 2005|publisher=BBC|title=French child killing case widens|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4226283.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Céline Saison''' – 18-year-old who disappeared in 2000 in [[Charleville-Mézières]]. Her body was found in Belgium.
* '''Mananya Thumpong''' – 13-year-old who disappeared in 2001 from [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]]. Her body was also later found in Belgium.

She had been raped and strangled. However, he has never been charged with her murder and 25 years on the murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8686507.stm | work=BBC News | title=Daughter murder 'may be unsolved' | date=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobby Jack Fowler''' (June 12, 1939&amp;nbsp;– May 15, 2006) was an American rapist and alleged [[serial killer]] active in the United States and Canada. He died in prison of [[lung cancer]] during a 16-year sentence following a conviction for [[rape]], [[kidnapping]] and attempted rape in [[Newport, Oregon]], in 1996 (for an attack that took place in 1995).

Fowler was a transient construction worker who is known to have traveled extensively across North America. He spent time &quot;rabbiting around&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[&quot;We think that was how he tried to protect himself, immediately rabbiting to another part of the country and establishing himself there,&quot; Lincoln County Detective Ron Benson, quoted in Lori tobias], &quot;Bobby Jack Fowler, suspect in death of Newport teen girls, may have killed 20 or more people&quot;, The Oregonian, October 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; North America to such places as British Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, Oregon, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee and Washington State.&lt;ref name=&quot;News.nationalpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/with-one-murder-solved-difficult-highway-of-tears-investigations-go-on/ |title=Bobby Jack Fowler: One murder solved as difficult ‘Highway of Tears’ investigations go on &amp;#124; Canada &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National Post |publisher=News.nationalpost.com |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/10/bobby_jack_fowler_suspect_in_d.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Bobby Jack Fowler, suspect in death of Newport teen girls, may have killed 20 or more people | date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels he developed an extensive criminal record and is known to have committed several violent crimes. An alcohol, amphetamine, and methamphetamine abuser, Fowler had a criminal record that included attempted murder, sexual assault, and firearms offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/no+arrests+or+charges+in+bc+missing+women+investigation+rcmp/6442721675/story.html |title=Global BC &amp;#124; B.C. teen murdered on Highway of Tears linked to U.S. prisoner |publisher=Globaltvbc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he was charged with murdering a man and woman in Texas, but was only convicted of discharging a firearm within city limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;News.nationalpost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;/&gt; Fowler also spent time in a Tennessee prison for sexual assault and attempted murder because, in the words of an investigator, &quot;he tied [a woman] up, beat the hell out of her with her own belt, covered her with brush and left her to die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oregonlive.com&quot;/&gt;

He liked to travel far and wide in beat-up old cars, frequently picked up hitchhikers, and spent time in bars and motels. Fowler believed that women he came into contact with who were hitchhiking and hanging out in bars wanted to be sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/Bobby+Jack+Fowler+linked+Highway+Tears+death+suspected+others/7298620/story.html |title=Bobby Jack Fowler: He was violent, charming and sometimes disarming |publisher=Thestarphoenix.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler is a suspect in the Highway of Tears murders. His DNA was found on the body of Colleen MacMillen, one of the presumed victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Fowler is also strongly suspected to have killed both Gale Weys and Pamela Darlington in 1973.

Their strangled bodies were later discovered on February 15, 1995, by loggers in a wooded area, covered up with brush.&lt;ref name=&quot;discovery1&quot;/&gt;

==Arrest and investigation==
On June 28, 1995, Fowler was arrested following an incident which involved a woman jumping out of a Tides Inn motel in Newport, Oregon motel window with a rope still tied to her ankle. She survived the attack and reported her harrowing tale to the local police.

On January 8, 1996, Fowler was convicted of Kidnapping in the 1st Degree, Attempted Rape in the 1st Degree, Sexual Abuse in the 1st Degree, Coercion, Assault in the Fourth Degree, and Menacing. He was sentenced to 195 months (16 years, 3 months) with the possibility of parole.

On 25 September 2012 the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Lincoln County District Attorney Rob Bovett named Bobby Jack Fowler as a suspect in three of the Highway of Tears murders. His DNA was found on the body of Colleen MacMillen, one of the presumed victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
In May 2006, Fowler died at the age of 66 in [[Oregon State Penitentiary]] from lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2012/09/25/0926-fowler-profile/ |title=Bobby Jack Fowler linked to one ‘Highway of Tears’ death and suspected in two others &amp;#124; canada.com |publisher=O.canada.com |date=1974-08-09 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Paul Franklin''' (born '''James Clayton Vaughn, Jr.'''; April 13, 1950 – November 20, 2013) was an American [[serial killer]] who gained notoriety for numerous murders in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His killing spree was the subject of a fictional novel entitled ''[[Hunter (Pierce novel)|Hunter]]'' by white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]]. Pierce said of Franklin that &quot;he saw his duty as a white man and did what a responsible son of his race must do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/murders-price|title=MURDER'S PRICE|first=Don|last=Perry|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of Terror: What We Can and Can't Know About Terrorism|first=Philip|last=Jenkins|isbn=0202306798|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was convicted of several murders, and received six [[life sentence]]s, as well as the [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher [[Larry Flynt]] in 1978 and [[Vernon Jordan|Vernon Jordan, Jr.]], the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases. Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid [[schizophrenic]] who was not fit to stand trial.

Franklin was on death row for 15 years awaiting execution in the state of Missouri for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;edition&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/19/justice/missouri-franklin-execution/| title=Judge stays serial killer's execution| publisher=CNN| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/11/20/joseph-paul-franklin-execution/3648881/| title=High court denies execution stay for racist serial killer| work=USA Today| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was executed by [[lethal injection]] on November 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217| title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed| publisher=BBC News| date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Clayton Vaughn, Jr. was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] on April 13, 1950, as the eldest son of James Clayton Vaughn, Sr. and Helen Rau Vaughn, and brother to Carolyn, Marilyn and Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/423604/LIFE-OF-HATE-AND-KILLING-BEGAN-IN-50.html?pg=all|title=LIFE OF HATE AND KILLING BEGAN IN '50|publisher=[[Deseret News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Clayton Vaughn, Sr. was an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] [[World War II]] veteran and butcher who left the family when Vaughn, Jr. was eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077938,00.html|title=On the Trail of a Murderous Sniper Suspect: the Tangled Life of Joseph Paul Franklin|publisher=[[People (magazine)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughn's sister Carolyn recalled &quot;Whenever [Vaughn, Sr.] came to visit he'd beat us,&quot; and their mother had Vaughn, Sr. jailed twice for public drunkenness. Helen Rau Vaughn was described by a family friend as &quot;a full-blooded German, a real strict, perfectionist lady. I never saw her beat any of [her children], but they told me stories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt; Vaughn later stated that he was rarely given enough to eat and suffered severe [[child abuse|physical abuse]] as a child,&lt;ref name=Gladwell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Damaged|journal=The New Yorker|date=February 24, 1997|pages=132–47|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1997-02-24#folio=132|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his mother &quot;didn't care about [him and his siblings]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/18/justice/death-row-interview-joseph-paul-franklin/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 |title=Serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin prepares to die |publisher=CNN |date=November 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that these factors stunted his emotional development, and said he had &quot;always been least 10 years or more behind other people in their maturity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

As early as high school, he had become interested first in [[evangelical Christianity]], then [[Nazism]], and later held memberships in both the [[National Socialist White People's Party]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and even changed his name to '''Joseph Paul Franklin''' in honor of [[Joseph Goebbels|Paul Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949029,00.html|title=Racist Rifleman| work= Time | date=November 10, 1980 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to try to start a [[race war]] after reading ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. &quot;I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,&quot; he would reflect later. &quot;It was something weird about that book.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wwwbbccouknewsworlduscanada&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217|title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed|date=20 November 2013|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
For much of his life, Franklin was a drifter, roaming up and down the East Coast looking for chances to &quot;cleanse the world&quot; of people he considered inferior, especially [[African-American|blacks]] and [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;  His primary source of financial support appears to have come from bank robberies.  He supplemented his bank robbery income with paid [[blood bank]] donations, which eventually led to his subsequent capture by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/serial-killers-part-4/|title=FBI - Serial Killers, Part 4: Joseph Paul Franklin|date=7 March 2017|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1977===

*On August 7, 1977, Franklin shot a young interracial couple, Alphonse Manning, Jr. and Toni Schwenn, in a parking lot at East Towne Mall in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He was convicted in 1986 on two counts of first-degree murder and received two consecutive life sentences.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, &quot;Man Is Convicted of Killing Interracial Couple in Wisconsin in 1977,&quot; February 14, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*In fall 1977, in suburban [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Franklin hid in the bushes near a [[synagogue]] and fired on a group attending services. In this incident, Franklin killed forty-two-year-old Gerald Gordon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt; He also wounded Steven Goldman and William Ash.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I8LHU4f_hkQC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;ots=OPf0-vKvIm&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978===
*Franklin claimed that, on March 6, 1978, he used a [[Ruger Model 44|Ruger .44 caliber semi-automatic rifle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayton2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mel Ayton|title=Dark Soul of the South: The Life and Crimes of Racist Killer Joseph Paul Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CO7wbCkKsYC&amp;pg=PA1745|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59797-574-2|pages=1745–}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ambush ''[[Hustler]]'' publisher [[Larry Flynt]] and his lawyer Gene Reeves in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]]. In his confession, Franklin said this was in retaliation for an edition of ''Hustler'' displaying interracial sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;
*On July 29, Franklin hid near a [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and shot and killed Bryant Tatum, a black man, with a 12-gauge shotgun; he also shot Tatum's white girlfriend, Nancy Hilton, who survived. Franklin confessed and pleaded guilty, being given a life sentence, as well as a sentence for an unrelated armed robbery in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

===1979===
*July 12, 1979: [[Taco Bell]] manager Harold McIver (27), a black man, was fatally shot through a window from {{convert|150|yd}} in [[Doraville, Georgia]]. Franklin confessed but was not tried or sentenced for this crime. Franklin said that McIver was in close contact with white women, so he murdered him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

===1980===
*May 29, 1980: Franklin said he shot and seriously wounded civil rights activist and Urban League president [[Vernon Jordan, Jr.]] after seeing him with a white woman in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. Franklin initially denied any part in the crime and was [[acquittal|acquitted]], but later confessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;
*June 8, 1980: Franklin confessed to killing cousins Darrell Lane (14) and Dante Evans Brown (13) in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Waiting on an overpass to shoot a racially mixed couple, he shot the boys instead. He was convicted in 1998 and received two life sentences for these murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/franklin/102298.html |title=''Ohio v.

*June 25, 1980: Franklin used a .44 Ruger pistol to kill two hitchhikers, Nancy Santomero (19) and Vicki Durian (26), in [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia]]. He confessed to the crime in 1997 to an Ohio assistant prosecutor in the course of investigation in another case; he said he picked up the white women and decided to kill them after one said she had a black boyfriend. Jacob Beard of Florida, was convicted and imprisoned in 1993 on these charges. He was freed in 1999 and a new trial was ordered based on Franklin's confession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horn&quot;&gt;[http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1999/01/30/loc_franklins_confession.html Dan Horn, &quot;Franklin's confession frees man: Judge grants new trial in W.Va. slayings], ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', January 30, 1999. Retrieved May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*August 20, 1980: Franklin killed two black men, Ted Fields and David Martin, near Liberty Park located in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt; He was tried on federal civil rights charges as well as state first-degree murder charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EEDE173BF935A35752C0A967948260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fNational%2fU%2eS%2e%20States%2c%20Territories%20and%20Possessions%2fUtah | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE NATION; Judge Denies Trial Request For Suspect in Iowa Deaths | date=January 6, 1981 |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apprehension, conviction, and imprisonment==
Following the two murders in Utah, Franklin returned to the midwestern US.  Traveling through [[Kentucky]], he was detained and questioned regarding a firearm that he was transporting in his car.  Franklin fled from this interrogation, but authorities recovered sufficient evidence from the vehicle to point suspicions that potentially linked him to the sniper killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;/&gt;

Franklin's multiple, distinctive, racist [[tattoo]]s, coupled with his habit of visiting blood banks, led investigators to issue a nationwide alert to blood banks.  In October, 1980, the tattoos drew the attention of a Florida blood bank worker, who contacted the FBI.  Franklin was arrested in Lakeland, Florida on October 28, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBI&quot;/&gt;

Franklin tried to escape during the judgment of the 1997 Missouri trial on charges of murdering Gerald Gordon. He was convicted of the murder charge.  The psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis]], who had interviewed him at length, testified for the defense that she believed that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and unfit to stand trial.  She noted his delusional thinking and a childhood history of severe abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt;

In October 2013, Larry Flynt called for clemency for Franklin asserting &quot;that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24579849|title=Larry Flynt: Don't execute man who shot me|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=October 18, 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was held on [[death row]] at the [[Potosi Correctional Center]] near [[Mineral Point, Missouri|Mineral Point]], Missouri. In August 2013 the Missouri State Supreme Court announced that Franklin would be executed on November 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/08/15/execution-date-set-for-infamous-racist-serial-killer |title=Execution Date Set for Infamous Racist Serial Killer |publisher=Splcenter.org |date=2013-08-15 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]] said in a statement that by setting execution dates, the state high court &quot;has taken an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 Aug 2013|first=Jim|last=Salter|title=Concern over pending Mo. executions|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/08/15/concerns-raised-over-pending-missouri-executions/jRrn2Xuq3gd3u5drmm6EUO/story.html|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Franklin's execution was complicated because it took place during [[Lethal injection#European Union export ban|a period]] when various European drug manufacturers refused or objected on moral grounds to having their drugs used in a [[lethal injection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21588916-technical-hitch-stays-executioners-needle-cruel-and-unusable?frsc=dg%7Ca|title=Cruel and unusable|work=The Economist|date=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response Missouri announced that it would use for Franklin's execution a new method of lethal injection, which used a single drug provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 Nov 2013|title=Missouri executes prisoner using single drug from secret pharmacy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/20/missouri-executes-joseph-paul-franklin-pentobarbital|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day before his execution, US District Judge [[Nanette Kay Laughrey|Nanette Laughrey]] ([[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]) granted a stay of execution over concerns raised about the new method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 19, 2013|title=US serial killer Joseph Franklin granted stay of execution|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25012654|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second stay was granted that evening by US District Judge [[Carol E. Jackson]] ([[St. Louis]]), based on Franklin’s claim that he was too mentally incompetent to be executed.  An appeals court quickly overturned both stays,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson-stay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-executes-white-supremacist-joseph-paul-franklin/article_2ccc002e-4105-5424-a7e6-e99702a1f644.html |title=Missouri executes white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin |publisher=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' |date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] subsequently rejected his final appeals.&lt;ref name=latimes1&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2013|title=Missouri executes serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-serial-killer-20131120,0,2989739.story|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2013|first=Lateef|last=Mungin|title=Serial killer Joseph Franklin executed after hours of delay|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/20/justice/missouri-franklin-execution/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' newspaper published on November 17, 2013, Franklin said he had renounced his racist views.  He said his motivation had been &quot;illogical&quot; and was partly a consequence of an abusive upbringing.  He said he had interacted with black people in prison, adding: &quot;I saw they were people just like us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wwwbbccouknewsworlduscanada&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/condemned-serial-killer-on-missouri-death-row-says-he-has/article_bff3dc15-9f96-5858-891a-a46d2ad5bd43.html  |title=Condemned serial killer on Missouri death row says he has remorse, is no longer a racist |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=November 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin was executed at the [[Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center]] in [[Bonne Terre, Missouri|Bonne Terre]], Missouri on November 20, 2013.  The execution began at 6:07 AM CST and he was pronounced dead at 6:17 AM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson-stay&quot;/&gt; His execution was the first lethal injection in Missouri to use [[pentobarbital]] alone instead of the conventional [[Lethal injection#Conventional lethal injection protocol|three drug cocktail]].&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt;

An Associated Press news agency journalist said that 5g of the [[barbiturate]] pentobarbital was administered.  Franklin was pronounced dead ten minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 Nov 2013|title=Joseph Franklin, white supremacist serial killer, executed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25016217|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three media witnesses said Franklin did not seem to show pain.  He did not make any final written statement and did not speak a word in the death chamber.  After the injection, he blinked a few times, breathed heavily a few times, and swallowed hard, the witnesses said.  The heaving of his chest slowed, and finally stopped, they said.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kohler|first=Jeremy|title=Missouri executes white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-executes-white-supremacist-joseph-paul-franklin/article_2ccc002e-4105-5424-a7e6-e99702a1f644.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard John Fraser''' (27 June 1951 – 1 January 2007), also known as &quot;The Rockhampton Rapist&quot;, was an [[Australia]]n convicted [[serial killer]].

== Biography ==
Fraser was born in [[Ingham, Queensland]]. He had a daughter in the 1970's with a woman named Pearl. He was also noted for having below average intelligence, to the point where he had trouble writing his own name.

== Crimes ==
Before a life sentence on 7 September 2000 for the abduction, [[rape]] and murder of a 9-year-old girl, [[Rockhampton, Queensland]], Leonard Fraser had spent almost 20 of the preceding 22 years behind bars for the rape of other women. He even raped a terminally ill cancer patient, with whom he was living with in early 1997. He was subsequently charged with four murders. Police found many trophies of his victims in his flat and [[ponytail]]s from three different women, which could not be traced to any of his known victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Bassingthwaighte| first =Ted | title =From Sexual Predator to Murderer| journal =Police news| publisher =[[New South Wales Police Association]]| date = November 2006| url =http://www.pansw.org.au/PolNews/Nov38-52.pdf| accessdate = 2 January 2007 | format = &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AFrom+Sexual+Predator+to+Murderer&amp;as_publication=Police+news&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050615215035/http://pansw.org.au/PolNews/Nov38-52.pdf| archivedate = 15 June 2005}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser originally confessed to five murders in an apparent deal with police to avoid general population in prison, but one of those victims was 14-year-old, [[Disappearance of Natasha Ryan|Natasha Ryan]], who was found to be alive and living secretly with her boyfriend in a nearby town after having been listed as a missing person for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Peter | last=McCutcheon | title=Fraser trial judge criticises media commentary | date=14 April 2003 | publisher=ABC | url =http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2003/s832080.htm | work =The World Today | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was an obvious problem in his confessions to crimes where no corroborating evidence existed and there was therefore reason for a mistrial, his defence did not file for one. Nor did his defence object to the prosecution using the same confession made in custody, which included the Ryan confession, for three other victims whose remains were found. The Ryan 'murder' was also based on testimony from a fellow prisoner who alleged that Fraser drew detailed maps showing where Ms. Ryan's remains could be located.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Victim in murder trial found alive, but three others are definitely dead, say police | url =http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/10/1049567807305.html | accessdate = 11 April 2003 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the judge in the case, Justice Brian Ambrose, heavily criticised the media for commenting on the value of confessions to crimes made to police under duress or to other prisoners while in custody, where no or little corroborating evidence exists.

In 2003 Fraser was sentenced to three indefinite prison terms for the murders of Beverley Leggo and Sylvia Benedetti, and the manslaughter of Julie Turner in the Rockhampton area in 1998 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mako.org.au/pedofraser.html |title= Leonard John Fraser |accessdate=2 January 2007 |last=Doneman |first=Paula |work=Movement Against Kindred Offenders (M.A.K.O) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kim | last=Landers | title=Fraser guilty verdict | date=5 September 2003 | publisher=ABC | url =http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/qld/content/2003/s851395.htm | work =Stateline Queensland | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At his trial, the judge described him as a sexual predator who was a danger to the community and his fellow inmates.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news | title=Qld serial killer dies in hospital | date=1 January 2007 | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200701/s1820028.htm | work =ABC News | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Fraser was being held at the [[Wolston Correctional Centre]] and, after complaining of chest pains, he was taken to a secure section of the [[Princess Alexandra Hospital]] in [[Woolloongabba, Queensland|Woolloongabba]], on 26 December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paula |last=Doneman |title=Serial killer in hospital after heart scare |publisher=News.com.au |date=27 December 2006 |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20977923-1248,00.html |accessdate=2 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218165802/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C20977923-1248%2C00.html |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he subsequently died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

'''The Freeway Killer''' was a nickname given by the media and later police forces&amp;mdash;to what they believed was a single [[serial killer]] claiming victims in California, United States, during the 1970s and often dumping the victims along freeways. However, there turned out to be three Freeway Killers who operated independently of each other, but just happened to select similar victims from similar locations.

The three killers were:

* [[Patrick Kearney]], age 37 when captured in 1977
* [[William Bonin]] and several accomplices, age 33 when captured in 1980
* [[Randy Steven Kraft]], age 38 when captured in 1983

'''Franz Fuchs''' (12 December 1949 [[Gralla (municipality)|Gralla]], [[Austria]] – 26 February 2000 [[Graz]], [[Austria]]) was a [[Racism|racist]] Austrian [[terrorism|terrorist]]. Between 1993 and 1997 he killed four people and injured 15, some of them seriously, using three [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) and five waves of 24 mailbombs in total.

Criminal psychologists characterized him as a highly intelligent but socially inept loner. His designated targets were people he either considered to be foreigners, or organisations and individuals &quot;friendly to foreigners&quot;.

== Mail bombs and IEDs ==
In December 1993 he started his first wave of [[mailbomb]]s. Early victims were the priest August Janisch (because of his help for [[refugee]]s), Silvana Meixner ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] journalist for [[minority group|minorities]]), and the [[List of mayors of Vienna|Mayor of Vienna]], [[Helmut Zilk]], who lost a large part of his left hand in the explosion. Other mailbombs which were discovered and neutralized were targeted at [[Helmut Schüller]] (humanitarian organisation [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]]), the [[Austrian Green Party|Green]] politicians [[Madeleine Petrovic]] and [[Terezija Stoisits]], [[Wolfgang Gombocz]] and Minister [[Johanna Dohnal]].

While attempting to disarm an [[improvised explosive device]] found at a bilingual school in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], police officer Theo Kelz lost both his hands on 24 August 1994. (Kelz subsequently became the first Austrian to receive a double [[Hand transplantation|hand transplant]], and made an impressive recovery.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgNkKNfmDDc |title=Theo Kelz hand transplantation |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Fuchs claimed responsibility for his attacks in a letter to the foreign minister of [[Slovenia]] in September 1994, in the name of the ''&quot;Salzburger Eidgenossenschaft – Bajuwarische Befreiungsarmee&quot;'' (Bajuvarian Liberation Army). In a number of subsequent letters, he tried to give the impression of a larger organisation with different units. However, from the second wave of mailbombs in October 1994 not a single one went off.

On 5 February 1995, four [[Romani people|Romani]] were killed in [[Oberwart]] with an [[improvised explosive device]] which was attached to a sign that read &quot;Roma zurück nach Indien&quot; (&quot;Romani back to India&quot;).

Between June 1995 and December 1995 he sent three more waves of mailbombs. Wave number three was targeted at TV host [[Arabella Kiesbauer]], Dietrich Szameit (vice-mayor of [[Lübeck]]) and a [[dating agency]]. Kiesbauer and Szameit did not open their letters themselves and were not hurt. Wave number four was targeted at two medics and a refugee aid worker, Maria Loley. One medic from [[Syria]] and Maria Loley were injured; the other mailbomb, targeted at a South Korean medic was discovered and neutralized. Two mailbombs of wave number five detonated early in mailboxes, the remaining two were discovered and neutralized. This was the last incident before Fuchs was arrested.

== Arrest, trial and death ==
[[File:Karlau DSCN7250.JPG|thumb|right|240px|The [[Graz-Karlau Prison]]]]
At this stage Fuchs had obviously become highly paranoid. On 1 October 1997 near his residence in Gralla, he followed two women in a car who he believed were observing him. When police attempted to question him on what they believed was a routine case of stalking, he produced another IED which he had kept in his car, and detonated it in his hands in front of the policemen. His suicide attempt failed, but he lost both hands, and also injured a nearby police officer. Fuchs was arrested without giving further resistance and, after a trial which many in Austria felt had fallen short of making all attempts to uncover deep details, was sentenced to [[life in prison]] on 10 March 1999. Through his unruly behavior during the trial, Fuchs had repeatedly forced his removal from court proceedings.

On 26 February 2000, Fuchs was found [[hanging|hanged]] with the cable of his electric razor in his prison cell at [[Graz-Karlau Prison]]. The prison physician determined it to be a [[suicide]].

== Unresolved questions ==
Although the case was officially closed after Fuchs had been sentenced, and although the &quot;Bajuvarian Liberation Army&quot; was determined to never have existed as a terrorist organization in the meaning of the term, doubts remained whether Fuchs had actually committed his actions without any support or tacit knowledge from sympathizers.

A thorough search of the two rooms in his parents' house where Fuchs had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which he would have needed to produce and handle the unstable explosives (including [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]] and [[Nitroglycerin|nitroglycerol]]) contained in his IEDs.

Most of Fuchs' &quot;confession letters&quot; exhibited an aptitude at verbal expression for which he was not known. Some had referred to internal affairs in police procedures that were not accessible to the general public.

Even more doubts remain concerning Fuchs' death. How exactly a man without hands (Fuchs consistently refused having his advanced [[Transradial prosthesis|prosthetic arms]] fitted to him) and under almost constant video surveillance could accomplish the manipulations required to convert an electric cable into a [[noose]] sufficiently robust for successful self-hanging was never properly explained. Moreover, no prisoner (especially not an obvious [[borderline personality disorder]] case with a very recent record of suicidal behaviour) is supposed to be in possession of anything (including belts and even shoestrings) that could serve this purpose – most certainly not an electric cable.

== Media ==
*In 2007, the criminal case was portrayed in the [[docudrama]] ''[[Franz Fuchs – Ein Patriot]]'', the role of Franz Fuchs was played by Austrian [[Karl Markovics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1104065|title= Franz Fuchs – Ein Patriot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In computer games [[Hitman: Codename 47]] and [[Hitman: Contracts]], a character named Frantz Fuchs is an Austrian terrorist, who served in [[Hitlerjugend]] as a youngster, planning to blow up a hotel at which a peace summit is being held.

{{nihongo|'''Satarō Fukiage'''|吹上 佐太郎|''Fukiage Satarō''|extra=February 1889 – September 28, 1926}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[rape|rapist]] and [[serial killer]]. He killed at least seven girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= [[Atsushi Hachisu]]| title=Satarō Fukiage | publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/sei-1.htm |date=January 1994 | accessdate=2007-10-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070817021413/http://www.h4.dion.ne.jp/~okino/kaikyou/sei-1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He murdered his first victim in 1906, and killed six girls between 1923 and 1924. He was tried for three out of six cases, but his exact number of victims is unknown.

He raped a number of women besides the murder victims and according to one theory, he raped at least 93 girls.&lt;ref name=yabusaka&gt;{{cite web | author= yabusaka| title=Satarō Fukiage Incident| publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/satarou.htm | date= July 19, 2007 | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimates say he raped more than 100 women.&lt;ref name=monsters&gt;{{cite web | author= | title= CHILDREN KILLERS| publisher= MONSTERS | language=Japanese | url=http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~moonston/child.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto]]. His family forced him to work at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=kanga&gt;{{cite web | author= Eruo Kanga| title= Sex Crimes| publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://kodomo.s58.xrea.com/seihanzai.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently changed jobs. At the age of 11, he had sex with a girl about 17 years old, for which he lost his job.&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt; At 12, he was arrested for theft. Fukiage learned [[kana]] and [[math]] during the two months he spent in jail. He was arrested again for theft soon after his release, but learned [[classical Chinese]] while in jail the second time.

Fukiage had sex with a 54-year-old woman at the age of 17. He later raped the woman's 11-year-old daughter and some other girls in their neighborhood.

==First murder and imprisonment==
On September 24, 1906, he raped and [[murder]]ed an 11-year-old girl at [[Kinkaku-ji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kanga&quot;/&gt; The victim was an acquaintance of his. At the time he was culturally considered to be 18 years old, although he was 17 years old under the western age system. In jail, he studied the works of [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Nichiren]].&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt; He was released in 1922 and found employment, but he was fired due to his criminal past. In April 1923, he was arrested for [[child molestation|molesting]] a four-year-old girl, but was released.

==Later murders and arrest==
Between June 1923 and April 1924, he raped and murdered six girls, ages 11 to 16. He was arrested on July 28, 1924. He confessed to 13 murders, but later recanted, and insisting that he had murdered only six girls and that a police officer had asked him a leading question. He wrote a book, {{nihongo|''Shaba''|娑婆||&quot;The Street&quot;}}. He was sentenced to death on May 17, 1925. The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld his death sentence on July 2, 1926.

==Death==
He was executed by [[hanging]] on September 28, 1926. The media reported that he went to die nobly, unlike many prisoners.&lt;ref name=monsters/&gt; In his book, he requested that parents take care of their children.&lt;ref name=yabusaka/&gt;

'''William Patrick Fyfe''' (born February 27, 1955) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[serial killer]] convicted of killing five women in the [[Montreal]] area of [[Quebec]], although he claims to have killed four others. He allegedly killed his first victim in 1979 at age of 24.

==Early life==
Billy Fyfe was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He was raised by an aunt and moved from Central Canada to Montreal (Parc Extension) in 1958. He lived as a normal child, although friends did have suspicions about the boy as he grew up.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  As an adult, he worked as a [[handyman]].

==Murders==
[[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] on the door frame at Mary Glen's house led police to charge Fyfe for the murders. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) arrested him on 22 December 1999, while he was returning to his pick-up truck after eating at a Husky Truck Stop near Barrie, Ontario. He has confessed to only a portion of the crimes he is suspected of committing.

Fyfe's preliminary hearing began on 6 November 2000. Jean Lecours was the crown prosecutor heading up the case against Fyfe. He is now serving a [[life sentence]] in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Saskatchewan]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. The four last victims he admitted to only after being incarcerated {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

He is also suspected by Montreal Police of being the [[serial rapist]] commonly known as &quot;The Plumber&quot; who was responsible for a string of violent rapes during the 1980s in downtown Montreal {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} .

===Known victims===
* Hazel Scattolon, a 52-year-old woman who was stabbed to death  and sexually assaulted in 1981.
* Anna Yarnold, a 59-year-old woman who was bludgeoned to death  on 15 October 1999 in [[Senneville, Quebec|Senneville]], Quebec
* Monique Gaudreau, a 46-year-old woman who was stabbed to death on 29 October 1999 in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts]], Quebec.
* Teresa Shanahan, a 55-year-old woman who was stabbed to death in November 1999 in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], Quebec.

'''Nick Fallon''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. The role was played by [[Blake Berris]] from November 7, 2006, to January 15, 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that Berris would return to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-blake-berris-days-return |title=EXCLUSIVE: Blake Berris DAYS Return |work=Soap Opera Digest |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned on August 27, 2012. His final air date was May 12, 2014, when the character was killed in a [[whodunit]] murder mystery.

==Storylines==
{{plot|date=May 2014}}
Nick, the son of Joshua Fallon and Jessica Blake (the daughter of Marie Horton and the granddaughter of Alice Horton), came to [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]] to get to know his Horton relatives. His medical knowledge and intelligence were put to the test when he was asked to help save [[Kayla Brady]], who was suffering from a rare ailment. He succeeded in saving Kayla, and found himself intrigued by [[Chelsea Brady]]. Nick created an online identity to chat with Chelsea in an attempt to get her to fall for him, and provided a picture of a handsome colleague of his when she pushes to know what he looks like.

Later, Nick helped Chelsea get money to [[Shawn Brady and Belle Black|Shawn and Belle]] who were on the run with their daughter Claire in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Nick's clever and brave actions on this mission caused Chelsea to take interest in Nick as more than a friend. However, shortly after returning from Canada, Chelsea discovered that Nick was her online love. She was devastated and saw Nick's actions as a malicious trick, thinking that Nick used the online lover to secretly mock her while she revealed her inner thoughts and feelings for the first time. She tearfully told Nick that she never wanted to see him again. Hurt, Nick had an affair with Chelsea's mother [[Billie Reed]], who, under the influence of alcohol seduced him. Billie and he both regretted it, and swore never to tell anyone.
 
When Nick saved Chelsea from getting raped by Dr. Reibert, whom she had been dating to spite Nick, she forgave him. Nick began tutoring her in math and this led to them dating. Unfortunately, Chelsea soon discovered Nick and Billie's one-night stand and their relationship was again in turmoil. Then, when [[Willow Stark]] accidentally set Bo and Hope's house on fire, she panicked and attempted to frame Chelsea by planting her hairbrush at the crime scene. At Chelsea's cry of innocence, Nick risked his medical career by stealing the hairbrush out of the forensics lab. Chelsea was so grateful, she was able to forgive Nick for his indiscretion with Billie, and they soon rekindled their romance.

Later, Willow emerged as a threat to Nick and Chelsea's happiness. When Nick stole the hairbrush, it left Willow as the only suspect for the fire. Nick felt sorry for Willow and lent her money. Willow asked for more money, and Nick leased an apartment for her and gave her his credit card to use for her and her baby. Willow used Nick's credit card excessively, then she called Nick and blackmailed him into giving her more money, credit cards, and all kinds of stuff.

Nick later went to the beach to meet Willow and they got in an argument and a struggle that lead to Willow falling, and hitting her head on a log. Nick tried to revive her but Willow died. He found the hairbrush in Willow's possession and buried it in the sand on the beach before calling for help. While Nick was investigated by detective Roman Brady, he convinced Chelsea to go to the beach and destroy the hairbrush. Roman eventually learned the truth, and gave both Chelsea and Nick a pass by closing the investigation.

Nick was also blackmailed by [[Kate Roberts (fiction)|Kate Roberts]] into making Sami's [[amniocentesis]] say that EJ was the father of Sami's twins.

Nick saved [[Sami Brady]] and [[Lucas Roberts]] from a bomb that Dr. Rolf planted, sustaining head injuries in the process. While suffering from a concussion, Nick went to Las Vegas and married a woman named [[Cassandra Arvin]], who was using the alias &quot;China Lee&quot;.  Arvin was eventually persuaded to sign annulment papers. Then she was arrested and went to jail for soliciting, leaving Nick with custody of her two sons, Artemis and Demarquette. Nick deduced that Artemis and Demarquette were not really China Lee's children, which she confirmed upon her release from jail. She had been hired to protect the boys, but refused to retake custody of them. A man named Umar Maboud came to Nick's home and claimed that he worked for the boys' parents and had been sent to bring them home. Nick did not trust Maboud, and [[Jeremy Horton]] (who was staying with Nick at the time) successfully fought him off. Weeks later, Chelsea was abducted and was permitted to use her cell phone only to contact Nick, who was directed to come to a designated location, alone. When he did, the kidnapper offered a hostage exchange: Artemis and Demarquette for Chelsea. Unbeknownst to the man, the boys had followed Nick to the warehouse, but were able to escape. While Nick worked to avert the detonation of what turned out to be a fake bomb, Artemis and Demarquette were rescued by Umar Maboud. Maboud really was in the employ of the boys' parents, who were wealthy foreigners with many enemies. Having secured political asylum, they wanted to be reunited with their sons; Chelsea's abduction had been a ploy by the family's enemies. Nick agreed to let Artemis and Demarquette go.

Nick and Chelsea got back together. He helped Chelsea find proof that Ford Decker was the campus rapist by breaking into Ford's room in order to take photographs of his drugs and journal. After the campus rapist situation was resolved, Chelsea and Nick grew apart because of her attraction to Dr. Daniel Jonas, and the two eventually broke up. Nick then began working on a research project involving alternative fuel sources and began a relationship with Max Brady's half sister, Melanie Layton. Nick ultimately began stalking her and was then revealed to be the killer of Trent Robbins, Max and Melanie's father.

On January 14, 2009, Nick was tried for the murder of Trent Robbins. Maggie and Melanie gave testimony as to why Nick should not be put in jail for the rest of his life. The judge agreed and gave Nick the sentence of 2 to 5 years in a facility and 18 months for good behavior. Nick was thankful to Melanie for her testimony as Melanie told Nick that she forgave him because deep down he was a good person.

On January 15, 2009, Chelsea comes from the hospital to the courthouse. Nick tells Chelsea he's sorry for everything and tells her to move on with her life. Chelsea tearfully tells Nick that he will always have a piece of her heart and that he can focus on getting better.

On August 27, 2012, Nick returned to Salem and, still in jail, had a parole hearing. Having been recently kidnapped, Melanie did not know how she felt. Against the advice of her family, Melanie decided that Nick really had changed, but wanted him to stay away from her. Nick was released and threatened by Chad to stay away. Caroline forgave Nick and gave him a job at the Brady Pub. Chad beat Nick up after believing that he had Melanie, since he had her scarf. Later, Nick met Melanie's former friend Gabi, and they started dating. On November 14, Gabi found out she was pregnant with her gay ex-boyfriend [[Will Horton]]'s baby. Nick agreed with Gabi and Will that he would raise the child, and that he and Gabi would get married. Nick and Gabi had a church wedding, but before they could be pronounced husband and wife, Chad objected, saying that Nick was not the father of Gabi's baby, and it finally came out that Will was the father.

At a later date, Nick blackmailed Will to give up his parental rights to Gabi's baby, by threatening to tell that Will was the one who shot EJ. With several other people around, including Sami, Lucas, EJ, Sonny, and an attorney Nick brought, Will signed the agreement. Nick and Gabi married in a private ceremony. Only later did Gabi learn that Will gave up rights to the baby, but she did not learn about the blackmail, though Will tells her he did not want to do it.

Nick had memories of something terrible that happened in jail, possibly involving another inmate, Vargas, who was recently released and  getting help from the church to adjust to regular life.  The terrible thing is later revealed to be repeated prison rape by another inmate named Jensen.

Nick was kidnapped, along with Gabi, and held hostage by Jensen. Will and Sonny saved them, with Will getting shot in the process. Nick then tried to make things right, considering that Will almost died to save him, and agreed to have Will's name on Arianna's birth certificate. Nick told Gabi the truth about his rape and about blackmailing Will.

Nick was fired by Kate in June 2013. In August 2013, when his parole was up, he was told to vacate the Kiriakis mansion immediately by [[Victor Kiriakis]]. Nick became obsessed with Gabi and got her a modeling job in New York, where he would be as well, hoping that they could be together. After Gabi yelled at him for interfering in her life, he followed her to the park where he tried to rape her. Gabi hit him in the head with a rock and Sami and Kate helped her drag Nick's body to the river where he briefly awoke before apparently drowning on November 27.

On January 24, 2014, Nick arrived at Gabi and Will's daughter's baptism revealing that he had not drowned. He appeared reformed but soon blackmailed Kate into hiring him. Nick also manipulated Gabi into giving him another chance, and she felt that she must do so or risk going to jail for trying to murder Nick. Nick later manipulated EJ and Sami into giving Gabi a modeling contract with Countess Wilhelmina. Later, Nick got involved in a custody agreement of Will and Gabi's daughter Ari, pushing Gabi to only let Will see his daughter at times she allowed it. Will and Sonny felt that Nick would manipulate Gabi until he had Gabi and Ari to himself. In the meantime, [[EJ DiMera]] found out that someone had pictures of him and [[Abigail Deveraux]] kissing sent to his house. EJ and Abigail later found out that Nick was behind it. On May 9, 2014, Nick was shot three times, once in the back and twice in the chest, and he died on May 12 with an open investigation into who was responsible. On May 30, 2014, It was revealed that it was [[Gabi Hernandez]] who shot Nick.

'''Fantômas''' ({{IPA-fr|fɑ̃tomas|lang}}) is a fictional character created by French writers [[Marcel Allain]] (1885–1969) and [[Pierre Souvestre]] (1874–1914).

One of the most popular characters in the history of French [[crime fiction]], Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from [[Gothic novel]] villains of the 19th century to modern-day [[serial killer]]s.

The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], in two respects:&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dvdoutsider.co.uk/dvd/reviews/f/fantomas.html | title=Getting away with murder, A region 2 partial DVD review of ''Fantômas'' by Slarek | work=DVD Outsider | date=March 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their &quot;working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two-halves of the story together in the final chapter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;/&gt; This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the [[film studio]] could produce sequels reliably.

New Fantomas stories set in period are currently appearing in Bold Venture Press' pulp magazine AWESOMED Tales.

The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by [[André Hunebelle]] in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1963 with [[Fantômas (1964 film)|Fantômas]], departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone, and by making Fantômas (played by [[Jean Marais]]) more of a James Bond enemy. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered.

==Overview==
[[File:Fantomas-mortquitue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A poster for the third ''Fantômas'' serial by [[Louis Feuillade]]. Fantômas wears his iconic black hood and black leotard, more sinister features than the traditional gentleman thief's domino mask and tuxedo.]]
Fantômas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Schütt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fantômas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to see Fantômas's tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Crime Fiction|last=Priestman|first=Martin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-00871-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantômas was introduced a few years after [[Arsène Lupin]], another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]] who enjoys killing in a [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] fashion.

He is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested [[rat]]s, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.

Fantômas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German Principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.

C. 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian Prince who was Fantômas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.

In 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and [[Mexico]]. There, he ruined his then-business partner, Etienne Rambert.

In 1899, he fought in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.

Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.

Fantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor who is employed at the newspaper ''La Capitale''. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was [[guillotine]]d in his place.

Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.

Fandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas's repeated attempts to break them up, married her.

Fantômas's evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girlfriend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.

== Characters ==

===Notes===
* The original covers by Gino Starace are often considered works of lurid genius in themselves and may be seen at the &quot;Fantômas Lives&quot; site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fantomas-lives.com/ | title=Fantômas Lives | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Fantômas book cover, showing a contemplative masked man dressed in evening dress and holding a dagger, boldly stepping over Paris, is so well known that it has become a visual cliché.
* The novel ''The Yellow Document, or Fantômas of Berlin'' by Marcel Allain (1919), despite its title, is not a Fantômas novel.
* The last novel written by Allain was published as a newspaper serial, but never appeared in book form.
* During the 1980s, the first two novels of the series were published in revised English translations: ''Fantômas'' appeared in 1986 with an introduction by American poet [[John Ashbery]]; and ''Juve contre Fantômas'' appeared in 1987 under the title ''The Silent Executioner'', with an introduction by American artist [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[silent film]] pioneer [[Louis Feuillade]] directed five ''Fantômas'' [[Serial (film)|serials]] starring [[René Navarre]] as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, [[Georges Melchior]] as Fandor, and [[Renée Carl]] as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial ''[[Les Vampires]]'', which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual [[vampires]]) is also reminiscent of the ''Fantômas'' series.

There was a 1920 20-episode American ''[[Fantômas (1920 serial)|Fantômas]]'' serial directed by [[Edward Sedgwick]] starring [[Edward Roseman]] as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas's nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by [[John Willard (playwright)|John Willard]]. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title ''Les Exploits de Diabolos'' (''The Exploits of Diabolos''). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title ''Fantômas in America'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackcoatpress.com/fantomasus.htm |title=Fantômas in America |work=BlackCoatPress.com |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221212201/http://www.blackcoatpress.com:80/fantomasus.htm |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
A ''Fantômas'' series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring [[Helmut Berger]] as Fantômas, [[Jacques Dufilho]] as Juve, and [[Gayle Hunnicutt]] as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by [[Claude Chabrol]]; episodes 2 and 3 by [[Luis Buñuel]]'s son, Juan Luis Buñuel.

The [[Fantômas (1964 film)|French movie version]] of ''Fantômas'' appears in the [[Czechoslovakia]]n 1979-1981 children fantasy series ''[[Arabela (TV series)|Arabela]]'' as well as its sequel series ''Arabela se vraci'', performed respectively by actors [[František Peterka]] and [[Pavel Nový]]. In this version, he does not perform a villain's role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fantômas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children's series ''[[Lucie, postrach ulice]]'' as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers' depiction.

==Comic books==

===French===
* &quot;Fantômas contre les Nains&quot;. A weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in ''Gavroche'' #24-30 (1941). This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, ''Fantômas et l'Enfer Sous-Marin'' was written but not published.
* A daily &quot;Fantômas&quot; strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels.
* Seventeen ''Fantômas'' fumetti magazines adapting books 1, 2, 3, and 5 were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963.
* A new weekly &quot;Fantômas&quot; color page, written by Agnès Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in ''Jours de France''.
* Finally, a series of ''Fantômas'' graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by [[Claude Laverdure]] were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: ''L'Affaire Beltham'' (1990), ''Juve contre Fantômas'' (1991), and ''Le Mort qui Tue'' (1995).

===Mexican===
During the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a ''Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante'' (Fantomas, the Elegant Threat) comic book series that became popular throughout [[Latin America]]. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films. Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.

This Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version – which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal ''[[Diabolik]]'' — and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by [[Lucha libre|Mexican wrestling]].

The Latin American Fantômas mixed Italian and Mexican styles creating a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] - just as the [[flag of Mexico]] and the [[flag of Italy]] are made different by the central emblem of the Aztec pictogram for Tenochtitlan on the Mexican flag. The French character wore a black mask like his Italian inspiration, the Latin American a white mask like Mexican wrestling hero [[Santo]] (literally 'saint' in Spanish) - Italy faces Africa home to a majority Black population, Mexico the United States mostly with a majority White population. These characters had to remain relevant and mysterious to their specific geographical regions to survive and succeed.

Apparently the series was also influenced by the ''[[James Bond]]'' movies, as Fantômas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fantômas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American [[Hugh Hefner]], who created ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males.

Latino Fantômas also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 &quot;Zodiac Girls&quot;, beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames – the signs of the [[zodiac]]. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their [[femininity]] and preceding [[Charlie's Angels]] by decades.

Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival [[Grupo Editorial Vid]] in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both [[Central America]] and South America. Fantômas continues to be one of Latin America's favorite comic characters. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below.

===American===
A short ''Fantômas'' story by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Romano Felmang|Roy Mann]] appeared in ''[[Captain Action]] Comics'' No. 1, published in 2009 by [[Moonstone Books]].

==Cultural influence==
The ''Fantômas'' novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the [[surrealism|surrealists]]. [[Blaise Cendrars]] called the series &quot;the modern [[Aeneid]]&quot;; [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] said that &quot;from the imaginative standpoint ''Fantômas'' is one of the richest works that exist.&quot; The painter [[René Magritte]] and the surrealist poet and novelist [[Robert Desnos]] both produced works alluding to Fantômas.

The movies were also very popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fantômas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: &quot;Seven Old Men and One Girl&quot; (1968, directed by E. Karelov) and &quot;Old Men Bandits&quot; (1971, directed by E. Ryazanov).  In 2007, Russian author [[Andrey Shary]] published the book ''Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen'', dealing in particular with this phenomenon.

==Pastiches, homages, and related characters==
* ''Fantômas'' may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, ''Zigomar'', the creation of Léon Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in ''Le Matin'' in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in ''Zigomar contre Zigomar'' for eight more issues in 1924.
* In France alone, Fantômas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are [[Arnould Galopin]]'s ''Tenebras'', Gaston René's ''Masque Rouge'', [[Arthur Bernède]]'s ''[[Belphégor (novel)|Belphégor]]'', R. Collard's ''Demonax'' and Marcel Allain's own ''Tigris'', ''Fatala'', ''Miss Teria'' and ''Ferocias''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/marcelallain.htm | title=Marcel Allain - Tigris - Fatala - Miss Téria | work=CoolFrenchComics.com | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1915 adventure film ''[[Filibus]]'' was probably inspired largely by the popularity of ''Fantômas'', although the film's title character, a female [[air pirate]], strongly resembles [[Arsène Lupin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Uomini meccanici e matrimoni interplanetari: La straordinarissima avventura del cinema muto italiano di fantascienza|first=Paolo|last=Bertetti|journal=Anarres|volume=2|date=Winter 2013–14|url=http://www.fantascienza.com/anarres/articoli/32/uomini-meccanici-e-matrimoni-interplanetari/|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the success of the first [[Fantômas (1913 serial)|Fantômas film serial]] directed by [[Louis Feuillade]], [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] produced another serial directed by Feuillade in the same style, ''[[Les Vampires]]'', about a gang of criminals. As Feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws, his next serial for Gaumont, ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'', starred this time a positive hero, a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of Fantômas. [[Judex]] was himself featured in various adaptations, sequels and remakes. The original ''Judex'' serial was released in the United States and appears to have been an inspiration for the American pulp character [[The Shadow]], who was himself an inspiration for [[Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Fournier, ''Super-héros : une histoire française'', Huginn Muninn, 2014, p. 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fantômas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two French stage plays: ''Nick Carter vs. Fantômas'' (1910) by [[Alexandre Bisson]] and [[Guillaume Livet]] (translated, ISBN 978-1-934543-05-4) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] vs. Fantômas'' (''La Mort d' Herlock Sholmes, ou Bandits en Habits Noirs'', 1914) by Pierre de Wattyne and Yorril Walter (translated, ISBN 978-1-934543-67-2).
* A number of Italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fantômas. Among the most famous are [[Diabolik]], [[Kriminal]], [[Killing (comics)|Killing]], and [[Satanik]].
* The British film critic and writer [[Kim Newman]] has argued that ''Fantômas'' inspired the ''[[Pink Panther]]'' film series starring [[Peter Sellers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slarek&quot;/&gt; In the initial 1963 ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|Pink Panther]]'' film, Fantômas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton (the Phantom), and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau.
* ''Fantômas'' also has many plot points in common with the 1969 Hong Kong movie ''Temptress of a Thousand Faces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teleport-city.com/wordpress/?p=921 |title=Fantômas Review |date=February 26, 2008 |work=Teleport-City.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215094929/http://teleport-city.com:80/wordpress/?p=921 |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paperinik]], (Duck Avenger) alter-ego of [[Donald Duck]] created by [[Guido Martina]] and [[Giovan Battista Carpi]] in 1969, is partly based on Fantômas. His predecessor, Fantomius, (Fantomallard) was obviously also named after Fantômas. In France the character is known as Fantomiald; in Germany as Phantomias; in Greek as Phantom Duck and in Spain as Patomas.
* ''Fantômas'' inspired [[Julio Cortázar]]'s 1975 novella ''Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales''.
* A character in the [[Doctor Who]] novel [[The Man in the Velvet Mask]] (1996) is named Fantômas.
* ''Fantomas'' was the inspiration for the character Mr. Ixnay, who appears in ''The Chuckling Whatsit'', a 1997 graphic novel by writer/artist [[Richard Sala]], creator of ''Invisible Hands'', an animated homage to old-fashioned mystery thrillers which aired on [[MTV]].
* In 1999, former [[Faith No More]] singer [[Mike Patton]] named his [[heavy metal music|metal]] group ''[[Fantômas (band)|Fantômas]]'' after the fictional character.
* There is a [[Marvel Comics]] character named [[Fantomex]], first appearing in August 2002. He was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]] for the title ''[[New X-Men]]''.
* In one of the [[The New Traveller's Almanac|back-story sections]] of the graphic novel ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II]]'', Fantômas is described as being a member of &quot;Les Hommes Mystérieux&quot;, the French counterpart of the League, alongside [[Arsène Lupin]], the sky-pirate [[Robur the Conqueror|Robur]], and the [[Nyctalope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.comp.dit.ie/dgordon/League/OtherLeagues/1910s/1910Mysterieux.html | title=Les Hommes Mysterieux 1910s | work=Comp.dit.ie | accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the follow-up, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', the League's encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fantômas detonates a bomb which destroys the [[Opera Garnier]], after saying in unaccented English, &quot;I win&quot;.
* The character of Spectrobert in [[Gahan Wilson]]'s book ''[[Everybody's Favorite Duck]]'' is a direct parody of Fantômas.
* Fantômas is a partial inspiration for the character of [[Phantom Limb (character)|Phantom Limb]] on the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' His last name, in fact, is Fantômas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in &quot;[[The Invisible Hand of Fate]]&quot;. It is revealed that Phantom Limb is actually the grandson of the famous criminal. Fantômas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode &quot;ORB&quot; as one of the original members of the [[Guild of Calamitous Intent]].
* Fantômas has a German cousin in the person of the (supposedly British) [[Raffles (Lord Lister)|Lord Lister]].
* In the story &quot;Fantômville&quot; by Nick Campbell, in the book ''[[Wildthyme in Purple]]'', Fantomas meets the time traveller [[Iris Wildthyme]].
* In the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]]'s ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', the Fantom (a character resembling the title character from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'') owes more than a little to Fantômas, although he is ultimately revealed to be [[M (James Bond)|M]], who in turn is revealed to be [[Professor Moriarty]].

'''Fantomex''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is commonly associated with the [[X-Men]] titles. Fantomex first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy#New X-Men|New X-Men]]'' #128 (August, 2002) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Igor Kordey]]. Initially introduced as a character similar to [[Fantômas]] and [[Diabolik]], he is later revealed to be an escaped experiment from the [[Weapon Plus]] Program.

==Publication history==
Fantomex resembles the titular character of the [[Italian comics|Italian comic book]] ''[[Diabolik]]'', whose film adaptation was released as ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', Diabolik's lover being named Eva. The character of Diabolik is loosely based on the character [[Fantômas]], the subject of a series of early-20th century [[France|French]] detective thrillers and a popular Mexican comic book adaptation, whose name is more directly reflected in Fantomex's own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #66], [[Comic Book Resources]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex's name, Jean-Phillipe, is a reference to actor [[John Phillip Law]], star of &quot;Danger: Diabolik&quot;. In addition, his Weapon X designation—&quot;Weapon XIII&quot;—is a reference to the secret agent protagonist of the Franco-Belgian comic ''[[XIII (comics)|XIII]]''.

After Morrison's run, the character made sporadic appearances in ''[[Weapon X (comic book)|Weapon X]]'' #23–25, ''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'' #20–21, 24, the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: The List—Wolverine'' one-shot and in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #515–522 during the &quot;[[Nation X]]&quot; storyline before becoming a founding member of a new covert X-Force as seen in the monthly ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' series.

In July 2013, Marvel announced the character's first solo series, ''Fantomex MAX'', written by Andrew Hope, and illustrated by Shawn Crystal.  The series does not take place in current Marvel continuity, and the character is not affiliated with any other Marvel characters.  In this series, the character of Fantomex is a more literal take on the Diabolik character, with a storyline less influenced by traditional superhero plots, skewing more towards the concepts  of intrigue and James Bond-tinged adventure.  Issue #1 debuted on October 2, 2013.

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Fantomex was created by the [[Weapon Plus]] Program to serve as a [[Sentinels (comics)|super-sentinel]] against Earth's mutant population. Weapon Plus created a population of [[Techno-organic material|technorganic]] organisms whose living tissue was fused with Sentinel [[nanotechnology]] at the [[Nanochondrion|cellular]] level. His mother, a member of this race, became pregnant when she was fertilized with [[Nanorobotics|nanomachine]]s, resulting in the birth of Fantomex. Like the rest of his people, he was born and raised in [[Weapon Plus#The World|the World]], a man-made environment designed to create super-sentinels, media-friendly mutant-hunters modeled after [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s. Although his nationality is technically British as the World was located in England, Fantomex claims he was raised in a virtual France with imperfect programming.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #13&lt;/ref&gt; He's developed a French sense of identity and persona; whereas his experiment designation at the World facility was &quot;Charlie Cluster-7&quot;, he usually goes by the name &quot;Jean-Phillipe&quot;.

===New X-Men===
During his first appearance, Fantomex seeks a safe haven at the [[X-Corporation]] in Paris while fleeing from authorities. He claims to be a mutant thief with the ill-defined power of misdirection. Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asks for asylum, which [[Professor X]] grants him. Fantomex explains to Professor X and [[Jean Grey]] that he is being hunted because he is one of the most wanted thieves in Europe. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey are able to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocks their mental probes. However, they agree to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surround the building, Fantomex uses his ship E.V.A. to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his home in France. While there, he introduces them to his mother and continues to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he tells the two that he has stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in the [[Chunnel]], and offers to sell it to Professor Xavier for $1 billion. After submitting his proposal, he puts himself in a light hypnotic trance and removes the bullets that riddle his body. Finished, he asks Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the Chunnel in an effort to destroy [[Weapon XII]]. The three speed away in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.

Fantomex then leads Professor Xavier and Jean Grey to the Chunnel disaster. Packed full of people and animals that Weapon XII has turned into mindless slaves, confusion runs rampant. Knowing that those who have fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence are lost, Fantomex kills [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] and all others who are mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slips a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the Chunnel. It was during the accident in the Chunnel that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the Chunnel before the authorities arrive.

Fantomex later travels to Afghanistan in an attempt to steal a list of the world's richest mutant slaver traders, the names on which he intends to blackmail. There he encounters an unconscious mutant known as [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], a former captive who unwittingly killed her captors by turning into a deadly sandstorm. Upon his exit, he encounters [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], leaving Dust in his care.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #133&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Fantomex contacts Wolverine and offers him information about his mysterious past if he helps Fantomex destroy Ultimaton, also known as Weapon XV, the last creation of the Weapon Plus Program. Fantomex, Wolverine, and the X-Men's [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] travel to the World, an artificial, time-altering environment designed by Weapon Plus to quickly develop and evolve new generations of super-soldiers.

The three are defeated by Weapon XV (Ultimaton), who escapes by breaking through the barriers of the World and flying to the Weapon Plus space station. The team pursues their target in E.V.A., Fantomex's biological spacecraft. Upon arriving at the space station Fantomex keeps his word by showing Wolverine the complete Weapon Plus database. Shocked at learning the terrible details of his past (including his role in the slaughter of the entire population of Roanoke while under the influence of [[Weapon X]]), Wolverine initiates the self-destruct sequence for the space station before catching and apparently killing Ultimaton (who reappears later as a subordinate&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Force'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;). Fantomex and Cyclops escape the explosion in one of the station's shuttles.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #145&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Earth, Fantomex joins Cyclops and a group of X-Men students in their fight against [[Xorn]], who had taken the identity of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He had gathered a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and had taken over New York City. With the aid of [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]], Fantomex, and the others were able to break into Xorn's skyscraper headquarters and bring him down.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapon X and Mystique===
Later on, Fantomex tries to track down [[John Sublime]], the director of the Weapon Plus program. However, upon examining his empty grave, Fantomex finds a note reading, &quot;Roanoke.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;  He locates the secret facility of the splinter program [[Weapon X]] and finds it abandoned except for [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]]. The pair reluctantly joins forces and travels to the site of Roanoke, a town whose inhabitants were slaughtered after Weapon X unleashed a brainwashed Wolverine on them years earlier. There, the three finally encounter Sublime but are opposed by his [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]] and forced to flee against overwhelming odds. In an attempt to escape in E.V.A., Fantomex is shot down and left for dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #25&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Fantomex manages to survive and some time later is contacted by the diminutive mutant [[Shortpack]] who seeks his help in assassinating mutant arms dealer Steinbeck, also known as the [[Prudence Leighton|Quiet Man]], in revenge for his killing of an agent under Shortpack's care. Fantomex refuses, not wanting to become responsible for allowing the good-natured Shortpack to become a killer. Shortpack is captured by Steinbeck soon after, and whilst investigating his disappearance the shapechanging mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a double agent for both Xavier and Steinbeck's ally Shepard, learns of his meeting with Fantomex. Though despising him after a past encounter in Madagascar, Mystique finds Fantomex in Monte Carlo, once again operating under the pretense of being a mutant thief, and learns of Shortpack's plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;  As she leaves to rescue him, Fantomex follows and uncovers her intent to assassinate Xavier. In exchange for his silence, Fantomex bids Mystique perform a heist for him. After she returns with the stolen goods (a vintage Spider-Man costume), Mystique infects both Fantomex and E.V.A. with a techno-organic virus, seemingly killing them both to keep her plan secret.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was all a ruse as Mystique knew she was being monitored by Shepard. Fantomex later resurfaces and helps Mystique capture Shepard, giving her access to Steinbeck whom she finally defeats.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystique'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign, Nation X, and Second Coming===
During his tenure as leader of HAMMER, [[Norman Osborn]] tries to take control of the World and the Weapon Plus creations. Wolverine and [[Noh-Varr]] head to the World to try to stop Norman Osborn but are soon attacked by a large army of Weapon Plus creations infected by Allgod (Weapon XVI), the living religion. Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex (who has apparently spent all the time since his last appearance &quot;stealing things mostly&quot; and admits he should have kept an eye on the World), and the two of them make their way to the World's brain (now a sentient being) where they are confronted by the Allgod drones, Wolverine included. Fantomex is not affected by Allgod because nanites in his neocortex render him incapable of believing in anything greater than himself. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World's brain, thus showing it some compassion, and disabling Allgod. Immediately after this, the three of them defeat Osborn's invading army of [[Deathlok]] prototypes. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he reportedly stole from [[Doctor Doom]] to shrink the World and take it for his own.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: The List—Wolverine''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards Fantomex is hired by a young mutant boy to hunt a rogue [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] stalking mutants beneath New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #519&lt;/ref&gt;  After dealing with the Predator X, Fantomex and E.V.A. run into Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who ask for his help to defeat the creators of the Predator X. Fantomex initially turns their request down, but is later convinced by the same young boy he helped to help the X-Men. Fantomex saves the team from a group of John Sublime's associates and later takes them home.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #521&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex remains with the X-Men on Utopia and is later seen in San Francisco fighting alongside the X-Men against [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion's]] army of [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] sentinels.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #525&lt;/ref&gt; Once the battle is over, he's shown to have secretly joined a new iteration of [[X-Force]], alongside Wolverine, [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], Psylocke, and [[Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncanny X-Force===
[[File:X-Force Psylocke.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fantomex with [[Psylocke]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' #12: &quot;Dark Angel Saga, Chapter 2: Interruption&quot; (art by Chris Stevens)]]

The first mission of the new team is an assassination job to kill [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], reborn in the form of a child and being indoctrinated by [[Clan Akkaba]] on their Moon base.  After defeating Apocalypse's Final Horsemen and getting to the young Apocalypse, no one on the team can summon up the courage to kill a child.  When the group resigns to bring the child back with them and to reeducate him, Fantomex fires a shot in the child's head, apparently killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Fantomex realizes a presence calling itself Weapon Infinity has started manipulating the timestream within the World. After a battle against Weapon Infinity (actually the transforming of all future heroes into time-travelling [[Deathlok]]-type cyborgs &lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #5&lt;/ref&gt;), it is revealed that Fantomex has actually cloned the Apocalypse child in order to see if the boy could become a hero if raised as a good man in a virtual environment deep within the World.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex is later abducted by [[Captain Britain]] who brands him a dimensional threat and take him to Otherworld, where an interdimensional court sentences him to erasure from existence itself. He is rescued by his teammate Psylocke, who turns against her brothers. Together they encounter the [[Skinless Man]] and rejoin their teammates to defeat The Goat, a corrupted future incarnation of Psylocke and Captain Britain's older brother [[Jamie Braddock]], who attempted to consume the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #20 - 24&lt;/ref&gt;

When Psylocke is captured by the newly reformed Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Fantomex sacrifices himself to save her. He is captured and killed when the Skinless Man cuts out his heart. With his connection to E.V.A severed, she believes herself dying as well. She survives, however, and evolves into a humanoid form.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #27&lt;/ref&gt;

After Uncanny X-Force disbands, E.V.A. attempts to clone Fantomex back to life, but due to his three brains, an error occurs and three different bodies are grown for each personality: the evil brain becomes &quot;Weapon XIII&quot; (originally referred to as &quot;Jean-Phillippe&quot;), and wears a costume with inverted colors; the noble brain becomes &quot;Cluster&quot;, a female version of Fantomex; and the mischievous one is restored to his proper body, taking the name of &quot;Fantomex&quot;. He goes on to continue his relationship with Psylocke.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; Fantomex and Cluster later hijack a plane (leaving the pilot drugged and the flight attendants bound and gagged) in order to find Psylocke and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], but Weapon XIII follows and kidnaps Fantomex. Cluster enlists the help of the new Uncanny X-Force (Puck, Psylocke, Spiral, and Storm) to find Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force (vol. 2) #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Pyslocke and Cluster travel to Madripor to hunt Weapon XIII. Weapon XIII uses his power of misdirection (which Fantomex and Cluster no longer possess) to confess his love to Psylocke. She agrees to stay with him only if he allows her to kill Fantomex, who betrayed her during a heist at the Louvre. During a heated battle she decides to free Fantomex and stun Weapon XIII, stating that she is done with all three of them.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Force Vol. 2 #8&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Force===
Cable recruits Fantomex as part of his new [[X-Force#Volume 4|X-Force team]] with the promise that he'll help Fantomex find Cluster and Weapon XIII. He proves a questionable ally, as he constantly bickers with [[Psylocke]] and has a psychic sexual relations with Meme, who he really knows is actually Hope Summers (who Cable thinks is in a coma). He also kills new recruit [[List of Marvel Comics characters: F#ForgetMeNot|ForgetMeNot]] because &quot;he was bored&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 # 10&lt;/ref&gt; The only concession that keeps Fantomex in line is that he gets to kill Cable every night,since Cable's body dies at the end of the day anyway and he has a clone ready to take his place the next day. Eventually Hope hacks into his mind and unwittingly transfers the super-mutant genetic code from mutant arms trafficker Volga. He then betrays the team, but is shot in the head by Domino.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11&lt;/ref&gt; This is short-lived since E.V.A. is able to reboot his brain using the super-mutant code and now Fantomex has wings and god-like powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he is tricked by Meme/Hope Summers into thinking he killed the team, but once he learns the ruse he vows vengeance. Fantomex is tricked again by Cable by agreeing to meet at various spy organization or organized crime locations for showdowns, but X-Force never shows; however, Fantomex still destroys the base, which ultimately helps X-Force's missions. Fantomex eventually finds X-Force, but is tricked by ForgetMeNot into teleporting near Hope Summers, who copies his super-powers.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of fighting him head-on, Hope implants a thought into his mind that one cannot be perfect, unless you have a well rounded personality, which includes inadequacies and insecurities. Fantomex cannot comprehend being perfect and imperfect, so he has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psychic blades to scramble his brain.&lt;ref&gt;X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Fantomex can create extremely realistic illusions (he calls this ability &quot;misdirection&quot;). This ability is based on &quot;reality skewing&quot;, rather than telepathy or holographic projection (Uncanny X-Force 14).

Fantomex has an external nervous system referred to as E.V.A. He has mentioned that E.V.A. emerged from his mouth during his time in the World and developed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel. The relationship between E.V.A and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A. experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. When E.V.A. is separated from his body, Fantomex feels no pain and seems able to ignore most injuries. Along with this symbiotic relationship, Fantomex is linked to E.V.A. via telepathy. He can see through E.V.A.'s point of view and can take control of her movement. However, this requires concentration on the part of Fantomex. Moreover, E.V.A, as a bio-mechanical being, can reshape her body into a variety of forms, fly herself, and generate energy discharges to be used as weapons.  Fantomex contains three brains that used for parallel and independent thinking as well as nano-active blood; the nanites in his brain prohibit him from believing in anything greater than himself, such as gods or any supernatural beings. He also maintains an internal back-up nervous system which can be engaged if E.V.A. is damaged. However, this system is less complex than E.V.A. and does not allow Fantomex to see colors.

He possesses enhanced strength, speed, agility, dexterity, durability, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance. Fantomex is also capable of registering frequencies beyond the hearing range of normal humans. He even once mentioned a healing factor.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself : Uncanny X-Force'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

His three brains, allow him to survive severe head wounds since his secondary brains can take over should one be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. In this state, he can also recover faster while placed in water. He can expertly read the body language of others in order to predict their attacks.  He is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a master of stealth techniques. His title in his birthplace, the World, was &quot;stealth-fighter.&quot;

Fantomex is a superb marksman. He used to use special bullets covered in sentient mutant skin that never missed their target (designed by Sir James Braddock, the father of Psylocke and Captain Britain) but he used his last of these against Archangel. He carries a variety of guns and other weapons.

His mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics. These allow his mind to remain completely unreadable, even facing the most powerful telepaths of the Marvel Universe (Professor X and the Shadow King among others).

==Other versions==

===Days of Future Now===
In one variant of the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' timeline (titled ''Days of Future Now'' and depicted in Frank Tieri's ''[[Weapon X]]'' series), Weapon X and the Sentinels are at war with Wolverine's X-Men and many other mutant groups, including Excelsior and Gene Nation. In this timeline, Fantomex becomes the host of Sublime and, possessed by the sentient bacteria, sabotages Wolverine's efforts to overthrow Weapon X.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' storyline, set in an alternate timeline 150 years in the future, the entire world is ruled by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] (possessed by [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|Sublime]]).

E.V.A. has taken on a humanoid form and does not want to bond with anyone else's nervous system after &quot;what happened to Fantomex.&quot; Whatever happened to Fantomex is never explicitly explained in the storyline, though it is strongly hinted that Beast's U-Man follower, Apollyon the Destroyer, is actually Fantomex.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #151–154 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men: The End===
Fantomex is depicted briefly in ''X-Men: The End'' as part of X-23's dream induced by the Ladies Mastermind, as she is stated to be in love with him in this reality. In X-23's dream, they are shown together playing with a small daughter in their backyard.

'''Marion Anthony D'Amico''', better known by his Mafia nickname &quot;'''Fat Tony'''&quot;, is a recurring character in the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Joe Mantegna]] and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=murderer&gt;Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Fat Tony is a [[gangster]] and the [[underboss]] of the [[Springfield Mafia]]. His henchmen include Legs, Louie, and Johnny Tightlips, and he answers to Don Vittorio DiMaggio.  The character somewhat resembles real-life mobster [[Anthony Salerno|&quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno]]. While serving his terms, real-life mobster &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno died in a federal facility located in [[Springfield, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/us/anthony-fat-tony-salerno-80-a-top-crime-boss-dies-in-prison.html|title=Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, 80, A Top Crime Boss, Dies in Prison|date=1992-07-29|author=James Dao|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile==
&quot;Fat Tony&quot; D'Amico was behind several of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s criminal enterprises. His [[racket (crime)|rackets]] included [[illegal gambling]], [[cigarette smuggling]], and [[rum-running|bootlegging]]. In &quot;[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]&quot;, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] contracts with the mafia to drive out [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s rival snack food distributors. Fat Tony took out a hit on [[Mayor Quimby]] in &quot;[[Mayored to the Mob]]&quot; in retaliation for a raid on their rat milk facility, which Quimby opposed, as they had promised him &quot;dog or higher&quot;. Fat Tony puts out a contract on Homer after his private security business interferes with the mob's interests in &quot;[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]&quot;. Homer would have been executed gangland-style if not for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] coming to the rescue with her rifle. Fat Tony's son Michael is first mentioned by Fat Tony as he is talking to Marge in &quot;[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]]&quot;, saying she drove him home from school sometimes. He is then properly introduced in the episode &quot;[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]&quot;. The episode also reveals that Fat Tony's wife &quot;was whacked by 'natural causes'.&quot; Fat Tony and his associates meet in what is known as the &quot;Legitimate Businessman's Social Club&quot;. Fat Tony played the [[violin]] in &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;.

Fat Tony dies in the twenty-second season episode &quot;[[Donnie Fatso]]&quot;, only to be replaced by his slimmer cousin &quot;Fit Tony&quot;. By the end of that episode, Fit Tony has taken to eating as a way of dealing with the stress of assassination attempts. His weight gain causes a change of nickname to &quot;Fit Fat Tony&quot; and eventually &quot;Fat Tony&quot;, essentially restoring the original character. In &quot;[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]&quot;, he supposedly marries [[Patty and Selma|Selma]], but the relationship falls apart when Selma discovers Tony only held a ceremony to make her his [[gun moll|goomar]] as he is already married to another woman.

==Name==
[[File:Paul Sorvino.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Fat Tony's visual appearance was modeled after actor [[Paul Sorvino]].]]

Fat Tony's actual name is the source of some dispute, as several different real names have been revealed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, Fat Tony is referred to in a news report given by [[Kent Brockman]] as '''William''' &quot;'''Fat Tony'''&quot; '''Williams''', presumably an alias. In the eighth-season episode &quot;[[The Homer They Fall]]&quot;, the announcer at [[Homer Simpson|Homer's]] boxing match against [[List of celebrities in The Simpsons#Drederick Tatum|Drederick Tatum]] refers to Fat Tony as '''Anthony D'Amico''' (incidentally the name of one of the three Re-Recording Mixers in the end credits), which he is called later as well, for example, by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. In the twelfth-season episode &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Frankie the Squealer|Frankie the Squealer]] claims that Fat Tony's birth name is '''Marion''', a reference to actor [[John Wayne]]'s real name, Marion Robert Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;(2009). Commentary for &quot;[[Insane Clown Poppy]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

===Development===
[[File:JoeMantegnaMay08.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Joe Mantegna]] was cast as Fat Tony because [[Sheldon Leonard]] was unavailable.]]
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Bart the Murderer.png|180px|right|thumb|Fat Tony and [[Bart Simpson]] in &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;]] --&gt;

Fat Tony first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; The writers conceived the episode before the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', which has a similar plot, was released. However, when it was, the writers incorporated references to the film in the episode.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; Fat Tony was modeled on [[Paul Sorvino]], who played mobster [[Paul Vario|Paul Cicero]] in ''Goodfellas''.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; The appearance of [[Springfield Mafia#Legs and Louie|Louie]], one of Tony's henchmen, was based on another ''Goodfellas'' actor, [[Joe Pesci]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Rich (2003). Commentary for &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the episode portrays a TV movie about the events depicted in the episode, in which Joe Mantegna will play Fat Tony (this was before it was decided that Fat Tony would be a recurring character).

===Voice===
The writers originally wanted [[Sheldon Leonard]] to voice Fat Tony. When they were unable to get him, they went with [[Joe Mantegna]].&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; It is his longest-running role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Liz|title=Catching Up with Joe Mantegna|publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=2007-05-25|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2007/05/catching_up_with_joe_mantegna.html|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantegna commented, &quot;you feel honored that they asked you to do a voice. The fact that they bring you back and keep writing for the character, it is very satisfying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs |first=Jay S. |title=joe mantegna one of us |publisher=PopEntertainment.com |date=2004-02-10 |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/mantegna.htm |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117192252/http://www.popentertainment.com/mantegna.htm |archivedate=2008-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantegna based his raspy voice for Fat Tony on his Uncle Willy,&lt;ref&gt;Mantegna, Joe (2009).

Commentary for &quot;[[A Fish Called Selma]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Mantegna voiced Fat Tony in a scene in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' that almost got cut.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Mike B.; Moore, Rich; Moore, Steven Dean; Silverman, David (2007). Director's commentary, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Fat Tony episodes, Mantegna favors &quot;[[Bart the Murderer]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]&quot;, because it was the season premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Joe Mantegna|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Reception==
[[IGN]] ranked Fat Tony at #18 on their 2006 list of the &quot;Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral Characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Iverson, Dan |author3=Brian Zoromski |title=Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral Characters|date=September 6, 2006|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p2.html|accessdate=2008-09-18|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star News Online listed [[Joe Mantegna]] as one of the 400 reasons why they love ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wilmingtonstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070520/NEWS/70518023/0/news36|title=400 reasons we love 'The Simpsons'|accessdate=2008-10-17|author=Jeff Hidek|publisher=Star News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Adam Finley of [[TV Squad]] called Mantegna one of the five best ''The Simpsons'' guest stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/|title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars|accessdate=2008-10-17|date=2006-06-20|author=Adam Finley|publisher=TV Squad}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot; the eighth best episode of the show, saying, &quot;This episode makes the cut because of the inspired Mafia satire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Orvted|title=Springfield's Best|publisher=''Vanity Fair''|date=2007-07-05|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/top10simpsons200708|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Playmates Toys]] made Fat Tony into an [[action figure]] as part of the [[World of Springfield]] toy line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://figures.nohomers.net/WoS_Figures_Celebrity_Series_1.html|title=Celebrity Series 1|accessdate=2008-12-09|publisher=The Simpsons Action Figure Information Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">'''Feng Meng/Beng Meng (Peng Meng)''', or '''Fengmeng''', ({{zh|c=逢蒙|p=féng/béng méng|w=feng²/peng² meng²}}) was a figure from [[Chinese mythology]] closely associated with the divine archer [[Houyi]]. He was the apprentice of the divine archer and was envious of his skill with the [[archery|bow and arrow]]. In a fit of envy and anger, Feng Meng murdered Yi with a club made from a peach tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Jeremy|title=Chinese Mythology|year=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|isbn=978-1-60413-436-0|pages=142–143|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in mythology ==
After his wife [[Chang'e]] consumed the [[elixir of immortality]], Houyi realized that he would never again be immortal and would soon die. He resolved to pass his knowledge and skills of archery and hunting to the next generation to ensure that they would live after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot; /&gt;  In order to do so, he decided to take an apprentice, Feng Meng; this apprentice soon became an expert archer but even so he was still envious of Houyi's superior abilities, especially after a fateful archery competition in which Houyi killed as many geese as Feng Meng did with his archery despite having a far more difficult target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Mythology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Festivals&quot; /&gt;  Feng Meng made multiple attempts on his old master's life; tried to ambush him with his bow and arrow only for Houyi to stop his arrows with a return volley. Finally, Feng Meng resorted to the use of a stick made from a peach tree to bludgeon his master to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Tony Allan, Charles|title=Ancient China's myths and beliefs|publisher=Rosen Pub.|location=New York|isbn=1-4488-5991-3|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stories are told of Peng Meng, set in times previous to or after this fateful event. In one telling, told during the Chinese 'Mooncake Festival' or [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], Feng Meng (rendered in this translation as Peng Meng), was the cause of Chang'e's fateful decision to consume the elixir of immortality herself instead of sharing it with him. In this telling, Feng Meng attempted to steal the elixir of immortality from Chang'e by force while Houyi was out. As she realized that she couldn't defeat him, Chang'e escaped the only way she could—by consuming the elixir of immortality and ascending to the heavens where he couldn't reach her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditional Chinese Festivals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Chinese Festivals|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/Festivals/78311.htm|publisher=China Internet Information Center|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewcanadians.com/CULTURE/mooncakefestival.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lauren Fenmore''' is a fictional character from the American [[CBS Daytime|CBS]] soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. Introduced by [[William J. Bell]], the character made her debut during the episode airing on January 21, 1983, portrayed by [[Tracey E. Bregman]]. In 1992, Bregman brought the character to ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', resulting in her migrating there fully in 1995.

The character was first married to private investigator [[Paul Williams (character)|Paul Williams]] ([[Doug Davidson]]) for two years. Much of Lauren's history on both soap operas revolves around her rivalry with villain [[Sheila Carter]] ([[Kimberlin Brown]]). They first fought over [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Scott Grainger]] ([[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]]) in the early 1990s, with a [[love triangle]] forming around the three characters. The character was married to Scott twice and shares a son with him, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scotty]] ([[Blair Redford]]). Lauren has had numerous other storylines with Sheila throughout the years. In 2000, Bregman returned to ''The Young and the Restless'', remaining on a recurring status.

In 2007, the character killed Sheila in self-defense. Lauren also has a long-running romantic history with [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), whom she married in 2005. They share a son together, [[Fenmore Baldwin]] ([[Max Ehrich]]). In 2010, Bregman portrayed dual roles as Lauren and Sheila's previously unheard of sister, [[Sarah Smythe]], who was also killed by Lauren in self-defense. In 2013, after twelve years on a recurring status, Bregman was placed back on contract with the series. The actress has been positively received for her portrayal, which has garnered numerous [[Daytime Emmy Award]] and [[Soap Opera Digest Award]] nominations.

==Casting==
Bregman initially believed her role as Lauren would be brief, but after six months the soap offered her a contract and she accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;article&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Walking the Tightrope of Success | publisher=Rosemary Rosst | accessdate=2009-02-24 | url=http://www.celebhost.net/traceybregman/article3.html}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Bregman began making recurring appearances on ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. Three years later, the actress left the role on ''The Young and the Restless'', migrating to its sister soap full-time until 1999. After a return guest appearance on ''Y&amp;R'' in 2000, Bregman returned on a [[recurring status]] on August 24, 2001. In March 2013, it was announced that after twelve years on recurring, Bregman had been placed back on contract with the series. She was downgraded back to recurring status in May 2016.

In 1985, Bregman became the first actress to be honored with the  [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series]]; when it was then titled &quot;Outstanding [[Ingenue (stock character)|Ingenue]] in a Drama Series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Children' Heads Day, Nominations|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|publisher=[[Black Press]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=May 30, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emmy Belongs To CBS But For Non-Winner NBC, Awards Day Was The Longest Day|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=August 2, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATAS 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The 33rd Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award Nominations |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/33rdAnnual_daytime_nominees_only.html |publisher=emmyonline.org and [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |date=February 8, 2006 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HiEUlRtm?url=http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/33rdAnnual_daytime_nominees_only.html |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATAS 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The 35th Annual Daytime Entertainment Emmy Award Nominations |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_35th_nominations.html |work=[[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |publisher=emmyonline.org |accessdate=May 5, 2013 |date=April 30, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HiF4EwPL?url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_35th_nominations.html |archivedate=June 28, 2013 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is known for her longtime rivalry with Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown). On the topic of Lauren and Sheila's &quot;cat fights&quot;, Brown said: &quot;People like cat fights because we can get away with what you can't get away with in everyday life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [boy] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting and by the end of the day, you're spent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Kimberlin Brown|year=2008|title=Planet Soap - Sheila &amp; Lauren on Catfights|publisher=TV Tropolis|accessdate=16 September 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUpwWHUO1Po}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren is also known for having been kidnapped on several occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;si&quot; /&gt; In 2010, she was involved in a [[doppelgänger]] storyline. A woman claiming to be Sheila's sister, [[Sarah Smythe]], had [[plastic surgery]] to look like Lauren; she wanted revenge on Lauren for killing Sheila. Of the storyline, Bregman said, &quot;Sarah really wants Lauren to suffer because Sarah has suffered so much. In Sarah’s mind, Sheila was murdered in cold blood by Lauren. Also, Sarah had to raise Sheila’s children because Sheila was always so obsessed with Lauren that she wasn’t around to raise her kids properly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Y&amp;R’s Tracey E.

==Storylines==
Lauren Fenmore, an only child, is raised by her father [[Neil Fenmore]] (Jim Storm) due to her parents divorce. Lauren rebels during her teen years, singing with [[Danny Romalotti]] ([[Michael Damian]]) and [[Traci Abbott Connolly|Traci Abbott]] ([[Beth Maitland]]), who was her rival for many years to come. Lauren spends years bullying and scheming against an insecure Traci. As she matures, Lauren falls in love with and marries private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]] ([[Doug Davidson]]), to the dismay of his interfering mother [[Mary Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Mary]] ([[Carolyn Conwell]]). A stalker named [[The Young and the Restless characters (1980s)#Shawn Garrett|Shawn Garrett]] ([[Grant Cramer]]) targets Lauren and forcing her to lave Paul by threatening to kill Paul if she didn't.  Lauren discovers she is pregnant and is buried alive by Shawn (after he overhears her true feelings for him), though eventually saved by Paul, having lost the child. Paul leaves Lauren for good after she sells a nude photograph of him to a magazine. Neil dies and leaves Lauren as the owner of the Fenmore Department store chain.

Lauren falls in love with and later marries [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]] ([[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]]). However, a mentally unstable nurse named [[Sheila Carter]] ([[Kimberlin Brown]]) plots to steal Scott away from Lauren. Sheila drugs Scott and sleeps with him, allowing herself to become pregnant; Scott leaves Lauren to be with Sheila for the sake of the child. During this time, Lauren finds out that she is also pregnant, while Sheila loses her child. Sheila then fakes a pregnancy and purchases a baby on the black market and switches it with Lauren's baby boy when he is born. Lauren is left to believe her child died, though Sheila's mother Molly (Marilyn Alex) tells her the truth. Sheila kidnaps both Lauren and Molly and sets fire to the cabin they are in; Lauren and Molly make it out alive though Sheila is presumed dead. Lauren later learns that Sheila is alive in Los Angeles and engaged to [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]]). Scotty dies and makes Lauren promise to make peace with Sheila, who he believes has changed.  When Sheila later attempts to drown Lauren in a hot tub, however, Lauren informs Dr. James Warwick ([[Ian Buchanan]]) of Sheila's destructive past.  Lauren helps the Forresters get Sheila committed after Sheila holds them all hostage. During her stay in Los Angeles, Lauren engages in a brief romance with Eric, to the chagrin of his wife and Lauren's former friend [[Stephanie Douglas Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]). They eventually break up.

After crossing forth between Los Angeles and Genoa City, Lauren returns to Genoa City for a permanent stay in 2001, when she begins a partnership with [[Jabot Cosmetics]]. Lauren then reunites with Paul; the relationship recurs due to Paul's unstable former lover [[Isabella Braña]]'s ([[Eva Longoria]]) pregnancy, as well as his romance with another ex-wife, [[Christine Blair]] ([[Lauralee Bell]]). Lauren is stalked by a teenager named [[Kevin Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Kevin Fisher]] ([[Greg Rikaart]]), who developed an obsession with her. After learning that Lauren accepted his prom invitation only to try to make him confess the crimes he committed, Kevin holds Lauren captive. During the abduction, Kevin tries to commit suicide, though his elder half-brother [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]) talks him out of it and rescues Lauren. This period saw Lauren and Michael grow unexpectedly closer, and they begin a relationship which soon progresses into an engagement. Lauren's now grown up son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) returns to Genoa City. It is revealed that Sheila had broken out of prison and had another female undergo plastic surgery to take her place; Lauren believes this is Sheila and resumes her normal life after an anxious period. Sheila has been living near Scott, who she grew close to. Sheila then returns to Genoa City and torments Lauren, involving Kevin's father [[Tom Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]) in her next scheme. After Michael and Lauren's wedding, they retreat to a honeymoon on a yacht. Tom and Sheila show up, and blow up the yacht, allowing everyone to believe Lauren is dead. In reality, Tom had abducted both Sheila and Lauren. Lauren is eventually saved by Paul, though Sheila once again disappears.

Lauren and Michael become pregnant, though stress over Sheila wanting to steal her child leads Lauren to suffer anxiety during her pregnancy. She gives birth to a premature son, [[Fenmore Baldwin]] ([[Max Ehrich]]). Paul locates Sheila in Genoa City; she underwent plastic surgery to look like Lauren's best friend [[Phyllis Summers]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]). Paul holds Sheila captive in a cage she created herself to entrap Fenmore. Sheila manages to escape and kidnaps Phyllis, her daughter [[Summer Newman]] ([[Hunter King]]) and Fenmore. Lauren frantically worries and eventually tracks down Sheila, Phyllis, Summer and Fenmore. Lauren shoots Sheila and resumes her peaceful life with Michael and Fenmore. In the following years Lauren helps Michael deal with his father [[River Baldwin]] ([[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]]) and sister [[Eden Gerick]] ([[Vanessa Marano]]), who return to Genoa City.

Lauren begins acting erratically, even sharing a kiss with Paul at a bar. Soon, she is abducted by Sheila's previously unheard of sister [[Sarah Smythe]] (Bregman), who is aided by Sheila's long lost twin children, [[Ryder Callahan]] and [[Daisy Carter]]. Sarah then poses as Lauren, as revenge for killing Sheila. Michael rescues Lauren and Kevin's wife [[Jana Hawkes]] ([[Emily O'Brien]]), who Sarah was also holding captive. Lauren shoots and kills Sarah.

Lauren's life is complicated when she learns that [[Jill Foster Abbott]] ([[Jess Walton]]) is Neil's daughter, therefore her half-sister. Lauren's estranged mother confirms that Neil was aware of an illegitimate child, and Jill is granted ownership of Fenmore's Department stores. Despite an initial bitter rivalry, Lauren and Jill soon develop a relationship. Lauren continues to strive in her business career, earning a seat on [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]]'s ([[Eric Braeden]]) board of directors at Newman Enterprises. Fenmore soon develops into a rebellious teenager, much like Michael and Lauren were during their upbringing, and develops an obsession with a now also teenage Summer. Summer and Fenmore bully a troubled fellow student, [[Jamie Vernon]]. Jamie and Fenmore have a fight on a rooftop, and Jamie falls onto a roof below. Jamie lies and tells the police that Fen pushed him, which is false. District attorney Michael is now forced to arrest Fenmore, weakening Michael and Lauren's marriage. Michael moves out and Lauren has an affair with the manipulative [[Carmine Basco]] ([[Marco Dapper]]), who develops an obsession with his love for Lauren. The affair is revealed, further straining the marriage. With much work, Lauren and Michael are able to get back together. However, they are soon forced to deal with an unstable Carmine who is consumed by Lauren, posting a video of their sexual encounter online and even kidnapping Lauren briefly.

In one storyline [[Neil Grayling]] ([[James Gaddas]]) drugs Jim in an attempt to seduce him. Ellis told Steve Hendry from the ''Sunday Mail'' that he enjoyed the playing the story because it gave him the chance to be funny.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt; He explained that it was a departure from his character's &quot;brooding nasty presence&quot;. Jim is a &quot;predatory character&quot; but the situation changes and he is the victim. The scenes have a dark tone to them and are not quite politically correct. Ellis quipped &quot;it couldn't happen to a nicer guy&quot;. Jim deals with Neil's advances by sexually assaulting his ex-fiancee [[Karen Betts]] ([[Claire King]]).&lt;ref name=neil&gt;{{cite web|last=Hendry|first=Steve|title=TV preview : Steve Hendry on the next seven days on the box; Fenner hits a new low|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+preview+%3a+TV+preview+%3a+Steve+Hendry+on+the+next+seven+days+on+the...-a085150018|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=28 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Fenner is initially introduced to the series as a Principal Officer, ranking him above both Senior and prison officers. During [[List of Bad Girls characters#Neil Grayling|Neil Grayling]]'s ([[James Gaddas]]) reign as Larkhall's 43rd Governing Governor, Fenner is promoted to Governor of G-Wing making him 43rd in a line of 42 others. During Series 4, Fenner finds himself the subject of (unwanted) sexual advances from Neil; after Fenner succeeds in having Neil fired, he takes over as The 40th Acting Governing Governor of Larkhall, putting him in charge of the entire prison. True to form, Fenner abuses the power granted to him in his new position and uses it to further his own ends, rather than to assist with the rehabilitation of inmates.

His main enemy within Larkhall was [[Yvonne Atkins]] ([[Linda Henry]]). Fenner continually attempts to use his authority to punish Yvonne for various &quot;rule-breaking&quot;, although she is often not at fault. In turn, Yvonne would use the respect she had earned among the inmates to work against Fenner. Eventually, it becomes clear that Yvonne and Fenner couldn't co-exist within Larkhall for much longer and Yvonne arranged for a hitman to dispatch him. Unfortunately for her this was unsuccessful - due to a tip off from officer [[List of Bad Girls characters#Colin Hedges|Colin Hedges]] (Tristan Surrock) - and ultimately, Yvonne and Fenner's long &quot;contest&quot; of one-upmanship culminates in Fenner locking Yvonne in a disused hanging cell on a redundant wing at the prison. During the first episode of Series 6, inmate [[List of Bad Girls characters#Kris Yates|Kris Yates]] ([[Jennifer Ness]]) discovers Yvonne's decomposing corpse.

Fenner is murdered in the same hanging cell where Yvonne died. He was beginning to feel the effects of a couple of previous assassination attempts from inmates and staff. [[List of Bad Girls characters#Julie Saunders &amp; Julie Johnston|Julie Saunders]] ([[Victoria Alcock]]) poisoned some candles using bleach, Neil spiked his drink during his farewell party, [[List of Bad Girls characters#Tina O'Kane|Tina O'Kane]] ([[Victoria Bush]]) appeared to give him a poisoned [[cheese straw]] during that same party, [[List of Bad Girls characters#Darlene Cake|Darlene Cake]] ([[Antonia Okonma]]) and [[List of Bad Girls characters#Janine Nebeski|Janine Nebeski]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]) used a crude [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] to fire a poisoned thorn at him. However, none of these methods succeeded in their purpose and Fenner clambers to the doorway of the hanging cell, where he is met by [[List of Bad Girls characters#Julie Saunders &amp; Julie Johnston|Julie Johnston]] ([[Kika Mirylees]]), who stabs him in the throat with an [[icicle]]. He dies in front of the hanging cell where he murdered Yvonne.

==Other appearances==
Jim features in stage version of the drama. The series' creative team Maureen Chadwick and Ann McManus devised the piece, which had been planned for four years. The musical was first performed in 2006 at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Veronica|title=Jailbirds stage a musical breakout|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3652618/Jailbirds-stage-a-musical-breakout.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=([[Telegraph Media Group]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
For his portrayal of Jim, Ellis was awarded &quot;Best Actor&quot; at the 2004 ''[[TV Quick]]'' Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street wins top soap at TV awards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3633628.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Purnell of the ''Daily Mirror'' said that Jim &quot;turned out to be the chief screw in more ways than one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purnell|first=Tony|title=Last night's view|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW.-a060445200|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=2 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purnell later bemoaned the storyline in which Shell tries to get &quot;sadistic&quot; Jim fired, he questioned if anyone knew or cared about the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Purnell|first=Tony|title=Last night's view|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW.-a060433481|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=4 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purnell later said that he hoped Jim would die after being stabbed by Shell.&lt;ref name=bottle/&gt; Tim Randall of the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said that the aftermath of the stabbing made for intense action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall|first=Tim|title=Television your essential TV &amp; Satellite guide for the week ahead; Samantha Bond's peroxide look may have scared her son, but it got her a new role, says Tim Randall|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Television+YOUR+ESSENTIAL+TV+%26+SATELLITE+GUIDE+FOR+THE+WEEK+AHEAD%3b...-a072193140|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=18 March 2012|date=24 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Mail's'' Hendry said that &quot;Mr. nasty&quot; Jim was the biggest villain on television. The character was voted one of [[Channel 4]]'s &quot;top 10 TV Bastards&quot;.&lt;ref name=neil/&gt;

John Russell of ''[[The People]]'' said that Jim was &quot;a screw evidently determined to live up to his job description, who lurches from one ludicrous scene to another.&quot; He added that &quot;grim Jim&quot; shared a torrid affair with Shell behind the back of his &quot;witless wife&quot; while having &quot;all the sexual appeal of a sinus wash&quot;. On Ellis' portrayal, Russell added that he &quot;just glowers in all directions and invites you to select whatever emotion you think he might be experiencing.

'''Feral''' ('''Maria Callasantos''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has been both a superhero and a supervillain and most recognizably associated as a member of [[X-Force]]. Feral is the sister of [[Thornn]].

==Publication history==
Feral first appeared in ''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #99 (March, 1991), and was created by [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]].

==Fictional character biography==
The cat-like [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Feral attempted to escape from the tyrannical rule of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]], [[Masque (comics)|Masque]]. She was saved from Masque by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and agreed to join Cable's [[paramilitary]] group [[X-Force]] in return for protection.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #100 (the final issue of the comic book series)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside X-Force, she first battled the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], and she broke [[Wildside (comics)|Wildside]]'s jaw.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; She then severely injured [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] during combat training.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She fought her sister [[Thornn]], when Thornn and Masque invaded X-Force Base.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; She next battled [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside X-Force, she battled [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]]&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #7, 9&lt;!--Not entirely sure about those issue numbers--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was later compelled by the [[Dredmund the Druid|Druid]] to go to Starkesboro, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #407&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] saga, she was attacked by the [[X-Men]] and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] alongside X-Force.  She was captured by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and was taken prisoner with X-Force by the X-Men and X-Factor.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #295; ''X-Factor'' #84; ''X-Force'' #16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Feral later received a new costume, and left [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] with the rest of X-Force.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; With X-Force, she then fought [[Nick Fury]] and [[War Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

Feral was always the ticking time bomb of X-Force especially when it came to teammate [[Siryn]], barely capable of controlling her deadly temper. Prior to joining the group, it was later revealed that Maria and her sister Lucia (who later became known as Thornn) had to leave home and lived with the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. It was later discovered that both girls had been [[child molestation|molested]] by their [[cocaine]] addict stepfather; in retaliation, Feral killed the man and shoved his body into the wall. Her mother, who was also addicted to cocaine, found out and sought vengeance on the girl by killing all of her pet pigeons. This infuriated Feral to the point where she also killed her mother in a fit of rage. It was also hinted at that she had purposely pushed their younger sister down the stairs, leading to her death, as well as allowed their younger brother to fall to his death from their roof. Ultimately, Feral betrayed X-Force and became the enemy of her former teammates when she was convinced to join the terrorist group known as the Mutant Liberation Front,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #28&lt;/ref&gt; although her alliances would continue to shift.

After a brief stint with the MLF, Feral emerged from hiding when the New York City police captured Thornn. Thornn revealed that she had seen Feral kill Harry Bellinger, their mother's boyfriend. [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] provoked Feral into admitting that she had murdered her mother. Cannonball overpowered Feral, and an old friend of Lucia's, police detective Jose Hidalgo, arrested her for killing three members of her family and Bellinger. During her jail time, Feral discovered she was infected with the [[Legacy Virus]]. She was either unable to be convicted or escaped, as she was next seen trying to obtain Isotope E (along with other virus sufferers) as a possible cure from the [[High Evolutionary]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}
[[Image:xforce90.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''X-Force'' #90 where Feral injures Siryn]]
Feral, now mentally distraught from her illness later resurfaced with a new incarnation of the [[Hellions]] led by [[King Bedlam]].  Although the team's criminal activities were limited to stealing the Armageddon Man to use him as a weapon, Feral left her mark.  All of the rage that she had felt for Siryn in the past boiled over in an argument where Feral sliced through Siryn's [[vocal cords]], incapacitating her powers.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

After being cured from the virus, Feral apparently had a change of heart.  She, as well as her sister Thornn, were recruited to be members of the [[Mumbai]] branch of the [[X-Corporation]] along with her former teammate [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]. The team helped save [[Professor X]] from an [[assassination]] attempt by a crazed [[Lilandra Neramani]], who still believed that Charles Xavier was [[Cassandra Nova]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;New X-Men&quot; #133&lt;/ref&gt;

She stayed with X-Corp for quite some time, but she returned to New York after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused the mutant [[gene]] to disappear from 90-95% of the mutant population worldwide, making them &quot;baseline humans&quot;. Both Feral and her sister were depowered and in [[District X|Mutant Town]], looking for answers.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

They both traveled to Wakanda where both sister met up with other feral heroes all of them animal in appearance such as [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. As a group, the four of them were to aid Wolverine in his search for his longtime foe [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. During the group’s investigation to find Sabretooth, both Feral and Thornn would be kidnapped by the enigmatic geneticist [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]], a 2,000 year old mutant. Romulus specializes in feral mutations preferring wolf-based entities such as individuals like Wolfsbane. Despite Feral and Thornn's cat-like exteriors, the girls would be put under extreme experiments that changed them on the genetic level.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

The sisters woke up and found that they were in a Weapon X experiment facility, and remembered nothing of the events that brought them there. Though not feeling any different except for their slight amnesia, they were more than surprised when they got up and looked at each other, the sisters realize that their bodies had been tampered with as they only saw their once mutant forms; cat-like in appearance. Whatever had been done to them had, in their beliefs, reversed their depowering and they were both mutants again.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

===Fighting Sabretooth===
Their memories however, began to slowly come back when Wolverine appeared. He was surprised to see their visages but gladly accepted the additional power that their mutant forms carried, should they wished to continue. Feral would choose to proceed, ecstatic in the chance to use her powers again. Now that Wolverine had finally found and secured the sisters he could continue his search for Sabretooth. The two would continue to search the facility they were in. With so many hallways and doors they inadvertently got separated. While alone, Feral stumbled upon Sabretooth. He was very different, more animalistic, even more so then normal. Confident in her skills, she willingly confronted him. In such close quarters and Sabretooth in his apparently mindless state, she would find the truth about her powers far too late. Sabretooth killed her. Wolverine would arrive right after Sabretooth had just killed her, too late to save her,&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' V3 #54&lt;/ref&gt; though he later killed Sabretooth, beheading him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Wolverine'' #54, [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the team regrouped. With Feral dead, it was then speculated by Wolfsbane that the sisters were still base-line humans. Only their outward appearances had been changed back to their once feline forms. Wolverine agreed, as it explained why she would have lost so easily. It would appear that Romulus only reverted their physical forms back to their previous mutant forms, without actually granting them their mutant powers. Feral's life would come full circle; she was murdered cold-blooded by a feral mutant in a berserker state as she in a similar state did too much of her family in her youth, many years prior.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Despite the fact that she had lost her powers prior to her death, Feral was resurrected and repowered by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#Transmode virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], she took part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]], and was seen attacking X-23 and Dr. James Bradley.&lt;ref name =&quot;XFv3i21&quot;&gt;''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hassling Wolfsbane===
Later as Shatterstar and Wolfsbane defeated a demon, calling itself a Sin-Eater, at a local church, the two are about to leave when Feral was waiting outside the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Factor 3rd series #220&quot;&gt;''X-Factor'' (3rd series) #220 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Feral wants to get Wolfsbane’s unborn baby for herself. The motive is not clear, however, she doesn't care if she has to rip it off from the cold dead body of Rahne Sinclair. Feral’s attack does not go as planned because she passes through Wolfsbane's body.  Feral thinks Shatterstar did something to her. As they speak, Rahne reminds her that she is dead. She comments about the way it happened since she was present there when it happened. However, Feral does not believe it but feels something is wrong about herself. As she pauses to collect her thoughts, she realizes that she is dead. She vanishes and later materializes, with her memories intact in the taxi Rahne and Shatterstar are riding, as they are being chased by their enemies.  She reveals that there are many supernatural entities, specifically animal-type gods with dog and cat forms, now after Rahne's hybrid unborn baby. They are using Maria's spirit as a homing beacon on Rahne as she was once part of the human world when she was still alive, with the promise that they will reward her service to them by fully resurrecting her.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Factor 3rd series #221&quot;&gt;''X-Factor'' (3rd series) #221 (Aug 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
She formerly had a feline mutation that endowed her with a thin layer of light orange fur covering her body, sharp claws and fangs, pointed ears, superhumanly acute senses including night vision and sense of smell, enhanced strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance paired with enhanced healing capabilities as well as a [[prehensile]] tail.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} Feral was depowered during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=June 2011}} She was repowered when she was briefly resurrected during [[Necrosha]].{{issue|date=November 2012}}

Feral was a fierce hand-to-hand combatant, trained in unarmed combat by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. She was also an excellent hunter and tracker.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

'''Joan Ferguson''' is a fictional character in the Australian television series ''[[Wentworth (TV series)|Wentworth]],'' who serves as the main antagonist from season two onwards. Joan is portrayed by actress [[Pamela Rabe]]. ''''Joan’s notable storylines is her one-sided feuds with [[Will Jackson (Wentworth)|Will Jackson]] and Matthew Fletcher. She is made the new governor of Wentworth after Erica Davidson is fired. The second series follows her turning Will Jackson and Matthew Fletcher against each other as well as replacing Franky Doyle with Bea Smith as top dog. After Bea becomes top dog, she turns against Joan and in the third season, their fight for power over the prison as well as Joan's vendetta against Will Jackson leads Joan to be arrested. In the fourth season, Joan returns as a prisoner of Wentworth, where she befriends Kaz in the hopes of taking out Nils Jesper, her former hitman who is testifying against her, and securing her release from prison.''''

During her time as both governor and prisoner, Joan is known for creating many conficts within Wentworth prison and its inmates. She is notable for killing Simmo Slater and staging as an overdose as well as attempting to murder Matt Fletcher. In the third season, she tortured Jodie Spiteri and had Bea drugged to stop her from exposing her as well as framing Will Jackson for the murder of Bea's ex-husband, Harry Smith. She also murdered Jess Warner and set the prison on fire to cover her tracks whilst her henchman also tried to have Fletcher killed again. In the fourth season, she manipulated Kaz Proctor into helping her murder Bea in revenge for Bea informing the police of Kaz's group, the Red Right Hand. This was foiled when Kaz found out it was Joan who called the police and revealed her identity to them and made it look like Bea. Afterwards, she used her knowledge of officer Jake Stewart's drug ring to have him kill Nils Jesper and help her hotshot Allie Novak, which led her to have no witnesses and her case dropped. Whilst walking free, Bea ambushed her in revenge for her attack on Allie and stabbed herself to make it look like Joan had killed her. The fifth season follows her second time being incarcarated and trying again to secure her release whilst the other inmates, including Franky Doyle, are out for revenge on her murder of Bea.

==Creation==
FremantleMedia Director of Drama Jo Porter said “Prisoner offered up a very rich well of amazing characters to draw upon and the Wentworth writers are very excited about revisiting the character of prison officer Joan ‘The Freak’ Ferguson in our second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/07/who-will-play-the-freak.html|title=Who will play The Freak?|work=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then announced that Pamela Rabe was going to portray Joan. It was said “In reviving the role of Joan Ferguson, Rabe adds to Wentworth‘s stellar cast and will undoubtedly add new layers to an imposing character…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/pamela-rabe-revives-the-freak-on-wentworth.html|title=Pamela Rabe revives The Freak on Wentworth|work=[[TV Tonight]]|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterization===
The Wentworth website states “Joan’s strength is her determination to succeed against the odds. She found a career in corrections and started as an officer. Her no-nonsense attitude won her fans in high places and she was fast-tracked to Deputy Governor of Queensland’s most troublesome prison, Blackmoore.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohotv.com.au/character/wentworth-joan-ferguson/|title=Joan Ferguson Character Profile|work=Wentworth Home Page|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
In a Joan centric episode, “The Fixer”, we see that Joan worked in a different prison, and was having a relationship with one of the inmates, Jianna. Jianna's baby was taken away from her, and Joan blamed Will Jackson, then a [[Will Jackson (Wentworth)|social worker]], for Jianna’s death. Joan wasn’t aware that, because of their relationship, Jianna was, in fact, killed by the other prisoners.&lt;ref name=2.9&gt;Episode 19: The Fixer&lt;/ref&gt;

As punishment for Franky’s drug trade, Ferguson makes the inmates watch as she bulldozes the whole garden project.

In the midst of Bea’s escape, Fletch finds out from Bryant that Joan assaulted Kelly to keep her quiet on her relationship with Jianna Butler. Fletch confronts Joan, along with the knowledge that she invaded his house and has a vendetta against Will, since he was the social worker that took Jianna's baby away. To keep him quiet, she has Fletch run down outside of Will's house.

Ferguson then demands answers from Doreen, [[Maxine Conway]], Franky and other prisoners as to information where Bea went. Joan later makes out that Bea and Will were complicit and planned the escape. She has Vera affirm this accusation since she has the knowledge that Vera euthanized her sick mother. When Bea returns she addresses Joan as &quot;Freak&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Episode 22: Fear Her&lt;/ref&gt;

When realising that Bea had a hand in the complaint, she gets her henchman to drug Bea and drag her into the exercise yard through the tunnels. Without Bea at her hearing, Jodie fumbles and is sent to the psych unit &lt;ref&gt;Episode 28: Evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

When being moved into general population in the prison Joan is subjected to [[verbal abuse]] by the other prisoners. Joan speaks with Kaz and tells her not to listen to Bea. She also talks to Doreen and makes her believe that she saved her son, Josh, in the fire and that it was Jess who is responsible for the burning down of H Block. This leads Doreen to protect Joan while she has an airing in the exercise yard. Joan asks Bea to beat her up in the shower so as to give the women what they want. However, while she takes a shower, Joan is brutally attacked by Lucy Gambaro and Bea, who was on her way to kill Joan, comes to her aid and helps her get dressed.

Joan then receives roofies from Tina's Asian crew, testing the tablets out for herself. As Maxine goes for her breast cancer treatment, Joan manipulates Boomer into believing that Vera didn't offer to let Boomer come with Maxine to prison. This causes Boomer to get angry at Vera, leading her to be slotted. With Boomer and Maxine out of the way, Joan has Kaz cause a fight with Bea while she slips the drugs into Bea's drink. While Bea goes to the kitchen to meet with Allie, Kaz takes Allie and the other women to make a stand for Maxine departing alone. Joan uses this distraction to have Bea immobolized by the drugs and attempts to drown her. Meannwhile, Will Jackson finds the phone call that put Kaz Proctor away and it is revealed that it was actually Joan who made the call, claiming to be an inmate at Wentworth so as to plot the idea that Bea Smith called Kaz.

Before her trial, Joan confronts Bea about Allie, calling her &quot;collateral damage.&quot; Although Franky manages to stop Shane from killing Nils, Jake hijacks Nils van and shoots him, setting the van on fire. Joan's charges are dropped and she is released. On her way out, she is confronted by Bea, who plans to kill her due to the attack on Allie. Joan overpowers Bea and takes hold of her knife. Bea then thrusts herself into the knife, making it appear that Joan has killed her.

===Season Five===
Joan is put in the isolation unit of Wentworth following Bea's death. She is then released into the general population at the same time as Allie comes back from the hospital following her overdose. In the exercise yard, Allie and a number of different inmates attack Joan. Joan fights back and proves victorious, snapping an inmates arm and strangling Allie just as she had done to Jess, scaring the other inmates. She believes that Vera was trying to help Bea kill her and conveys this to her lawyer, Jake and Vera herself. Since this is true, Vera makes it appear that Bea had used another officer's card to escape and kill Joan, infuriating her.

==Reception==

''Metro'' said, &quot;Joan 'The Freak' Ferguson isn't just the most terrifying character in all prison dramas - she's the baddest and most sinister baddie ever to grace TV.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/07/22/10-reasons-wentworth-prison-is-better-than-orange-is-the-new-black-5307336/|title=10 reasons why Wentworth Prison is better than Orange Is The New Black|work=Metro|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Rabe was nominated for a [[Logie Awards of 2016|Logie Award]] in the category &quot;Most Outstanding Actress&quot; for her portrayal of Joan Ferguson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/shows/tv-buzz/a/31244589/2016-logie-nominations-announced/|title=2016 Logie nominations announced|work=Yahoo|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graeme Blundell of the Australian wrote &quot;So much awe surrounds Ferguson that she seems to possess supernatural powers, a Hannibal Lecter-like superhuman cunning and lack of empathy, though Rabe, a performer of unerring grace and authenticity, is such an accomplished actress she avoids the melodrama, turning Ferguson into one of the most believable villains we’ve seen on the local screen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/wentworth-prison-drama-with-pamela-rabe-returns-for-fifth-season/news-story/85e364fd322ad226eece65e860d13670&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Fisk''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[criminal]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the son of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and his wife [[Vanessa Fisk]]. Although he was originally a [[villain]], he became an [[antihero]].

The character first appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83 (April 1970) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]]

==Publication history==
The character Richard Fisk first appears as '''The Schemer''' in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #83 (April 1970), created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]] He first appeared as '''The Rose''' in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253 (June 1984), but was not revealed as the Rose until ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286 (March 1987).&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Richard Fisk grew up as a child of privilege, believing that his father Wilson Fisk was a respectable and honorable businessman. Wilson was sometimes abusive to Richard, but Richard still loved him. At one point he and his childhood friend [[Samuel Silke]] saw Wilson roughing up someone. It was when he was attending a prestigious college in [[Switzerland]] that he discovered that his father was, in reality, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] of Crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #29&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the luxuries of his youth had been financed by a criminal empire, Richard was distraught and vowed to make atonement for his father's crimes. When his parents received word that Richard had perished in a skiing accident, they suspected that it was really a suicide after Richard learned the truth of his father's identity. Heartbroken and furious that his son could have acted so spinelessly, the Kingpin sunk into a spell of depression.{{issue|date=April 2012}}

===Schemer===
[[File:Schemer.png|175px|thumb|left|Cover of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83. Art by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]
Not long afterward, a new gang emerged in New York, led by a mysterious figure calling himself the '''Schemer'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most gangs in New York, the Schemer's organization seemed bent solely on dismantling the Kingpin's empire. After a series of confrontations, the Kingpin and the Schemer finally met face to face. It was then that the Schemer revealed that his face was really a mask, and that his true face was that of Richard Fisk. Richard explained that he had faked his death in the Alps and was striking back at his father using his own money. This final shock was too much for the Kingpin to bear, and he collapsed into [[catatonia]]. This finally made Richard realize how much he had hurt his father, and he set off to find a way to cure his comatose state. Richard joined the international [[terrorism|terrorist]] group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], becoming a leader of the Nevada fragment of HYDRA and eventually rising to the rank of Supreme Hydra. Now with HYDRA's expansive medical resources at his disposal, Richard was able to return his father to full health. The Kingpin, reconciled with his son, proved that he was back to normal by clandestinely taking over as ruler of HYDRA. However, it was soon revealed that the true leader of HYDRA was the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[supervillain]] the [[Red Skull]], and the Fisks had to team up with [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to stop the mad dictator. Richard was critically wounded in the final battle, and the Kingpin had his son placed in [[suspended animation]], finally curing him by siphoning some life force from [[Spider-Man]].

===Rose===
Several years later, Richard joined his father's organization, calling himself the '''[[Rose (Marvel Comics)|Rose]]''', a crime lord under the Kingpin's control. However, this was all a ruse to undermine the Kingpin's empire from within. Aiding Richard in this scheme were his good friend Alfredo Morelli and [[Ned Leeds]], who was brainwashed to act as the supervillain the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. However, the Rose's subterfuge resulted in an explosive gang war that tore New York City apart. During a shoot-out Richard shot and killed a police officer, an act that became a turning point for him - no longer could he consider himself morally superior to his father. After Leeds' death and the end of the gang war, Richard resigned himself to his birthright and rejoined the Kingpin's organization as himself. However, the desire to overthrow his father once again arose, and Richard and Alfredo plotted to make the Kingpin think that Richard was ready to inherit his father's position. Alfredo had plastic surgery to make himself look just like Richard (since he had more combat experience), and slowly began climbing the ladder of power. However, when the Kingpin was overthrown by the combined forces of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and HYDRA, Alfredo betrayed his old friend by maintaining that he was truly Richard, and took over as the new Kingpin. Richard then became '''Blood Rose''', a [[Punisher]]-like [[vigilante]], and began gunning down criminals in a bloody purge of the city. The Blood Rose even shot and wounded Alfredo, who later returned under the alias of Gauntlet, although he was ultimately defeated by [[Nightwatch (comics)|NightWatch]] and incarcerated. Finally caught by Spider-Man and arrested, Richard entered the Witness Protection Program.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #253-286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Coup===
Years later, Wilson Fisk once again regained the mantle of the Kingpin, and Richard re-emerged to public life and rejoined the Kingpin's organization, once again vowing to never again attempt to overthrow his father. However, upon meeting his old childhood friend, the ambitious enforcer Silke, Richard thought that he at last had found the perfect way to make his father pay for his crimes. Silke's assassination attempt nearly did succeed, stabbing and seriously wounding the Kingpin (already blinded from an earlier attempt on his life). However, Richard did not count on the tenacity of his mother, Vanessa. Vanessa quickly made a startling counter-strike, eliminating the rebellion and selling her husband's territory so he could travel to [[Europe]] and recover. Richard cornered her, insisting that by getting rid of the Kingpin they could be free to have a new life, but Vanessa coldly shot her son dead, eliminating him as a threat once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Richard Fisk has no superhuman powers, however he is trained in the use of guns and has some martial arts training. He is highly intelligent and also has a number of criminal contacts. As the Rose he wears a bulletproof three-piece suit. He always carries a handgun and often a variety of mini-grenades as well.

==Other versions==
Another version of Richard Fisk appeared in [[PunisherMAX]]'s first story arc called &quot;Kingpin&quot;. Here, he is depicted as an eight-year-old child rather than a young adult, and his death is caused by his father's takeover of the mob. During his final confrontation with Fisk, mob boss Rigoletto takes Richard hostage and threatens to kill him but Fisk, showing no concern for his son's fate, stands idly by as Rigoletto slits the boy's throat. Fisk later reflects that he had always thought that he was trying to advance his criminal career for his son's sake, while in reality it was only for himself. Richard's fate causes Vanessa Fisk to plot the downfall of her estranged husband.&lt;ref&gt;''PunisherMax'' #1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Fisk appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Nick Jameson]]. In this continuity, Richard is loyal to his father and heads a [[front company]] called Fisktronics. In the two-part episode &quot;Framed&quot; and &quot;The Man Without Fear,&quot; Wilson Fisk hires Peter Parker to work for Fisktronics under Richard Fisk. Richard frames Peter Parker for selling government secrets with the help of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. Spider-Man and Daredevil successfully team up to clear Parker's name, which results in Fisk's arrest and conviction, in part due to his father's machinations. In the episode &quot;Guilty,&quot; Richard teams up with [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], who is incarcerated in the same prison, to frame Robbie Robertson. Fisk makes his final appearance in &quot;The Prowler&quot; in a flashback appearance when he is saved by [[Prowler (comics)|Hobie Brown]].

'''Vanessa Fisk''' is a fictional comic book character appearing in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. As the wife of mobster Wilson Fisk, the so-called [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]], and the mother of [[Richard Fisk]], she appears as a supporting character in stories featuring those villains, usually those starring [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Spider-Man]].

The character has appeared in media adaptations, including the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', in which she is portrayed by [[Ayelet Zurer]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita, Sr.]], she first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #70 (March 1969).

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about Vanessa Fisk's personal life and early years. No maiden name has ever been revealed. As the wife of [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], the &quot;Kingpin&quot; of New York's criminal underworld, Vanessa did not approve of her husband's criminal activities. At one point their son [[Richard Fisk]] became involved in a plot to overthrow his father's criminal syndicate after discovering he was the Kingpin.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

After the Kingpin had a near-death experience, Vanessa gave him an ultimatum; he had twenty-four hours to get out of crime, or she would leave him. The Kingpin was about to kill Spider-Man when the deadline passed, and Vanessa forced him to choose between Spider-Man's life or their life together. He chose his wife and spared Spider-Man as a result.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #197. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

The two went into retirement in Japan. Kingpin prepared to settle his remaining business with his fellow mobsters by cooperating with the authorities and leaving the world of crime forever. This infuriated one of Kingpin's closest advisors, Lynch, who believed that Vanessa was a liability and had turned the once mighty Kingpin into a henpecked husband. When Fisk's former lieutenants in New York caught wind of his plans to sell them out in exchange for immunity, they kidnapped Vanessa, who was in town to secure the legal services of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] and [[Foggy Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #170. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisk started a gang war against the mob in New York to rescue his wife. The mob bosses attempted to ransom Vanessa off in exchange for the evidence against them Fisk had intended to turn over to the authorities, but during the exchange, Kingpin used a sonic device to stop the criminals, and found her bound and gagged in a building. However Lynch fired an explosive at Vanessa, in an attempt to deprive Fisk of the thing that kept him retired and bring him back as the Kingpin of Crime. However, she was buried alive in the rubble and presumed dead, although she did not actually die.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #171. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; As planned, this drove Kingpin back into the world of crime, although he found out Lynch was behind the explosion, partially due to a headache he gained, and took revenge by murdering his traitorous advisor. He then forced the remaining mob leaders to confess to hiring the assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to kill several of Fisk's men.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #172. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Weeks later, Matt Murdock's alter ego, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], found Vanessa in the sewers. Being buried alive had left Vanessa amnesiac and mentally unstable, and she ended up taken in by a grotesque mutant who lived in the sewers. Daredevil ultimately used her as leverage to force Kingpin to order his puppet Randolph Cherryh, newly elected to the office of mayor, to resign and to confirm to the media that he was indeed a mob puppet. After reuniting with her, Kingpin had his now catatonic wife shipped off to a sanitarium in Europe in order to have her regain her sanity. This would take years, as Vanessa's husband's organized crime empire would fall and be rebuilt during the period that Vanessa was institutionalized.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

Ultimately Vanessa would recover, and she would remain in Europe. But when her husband was the victim of an assassination attempt orchestrated by her son, Vanessa arranged for her husband to be shipped out of the country to recover from his injuries, and to cut a deal with his fellow mob bosses to divide up Fisk's recently rebuilt crime syndicate in exchange for a truce. Vanessa then took the final, brutal step of personally murdering her own devoted son, who admitted to Vanessa that his motivation was to rid the family of his father, who he blamed for his family's troubles.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The act of murdering her own beloved son caused a horrific physical toll on Vanessa, causing her to slowly lose the will to live, which along with the injuries she sustained when she was buried alive, culminated in her body undergoing terminal organ failure. Blaming both her husband and Matt Murdock, who had recently been revealed to be Daredevil, for the endless cycle of violence that had consumed her family, Vanessa faked the death of Foggy Nelson in an attempt to provoke Murdock into killing Fisk while they were both in prison. When that failed, she manipulated the super-hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] into posing as Daredevil, which ultimately drove Matt to break out of prison to find Foggy's murderer and the identity of the man impersonating him, culminating in her confronting Matt with an offer to clear his name in exchange for him clearing Kingpin, so that the two would be free to try and kill each other anew.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #92. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Daredevil refused this deal, Vanessa went ahead and arranged for the murder of Leland Drummond, the corrupt [[FBI]] director who outed Matt in order to advance his own career within the FBI. To discredit his outing of Daredevil, the murder was made to look like a suicide and a false and highly damning suicide note was planted at the scene, claiming that Drummond took his own life after it became apparent that his scheme to frame Matt Murdock was about to be exposed. Shortly afterwards, Vanessa died and Murdock found himself morally guilted into serving as the Kingpin's lawyer, getting the charges dropped on the grounds that the evidence was too tainted to bring him to court. But Daredevil would exact his own form of Faustian bargain with Kingpin, as he forced the crime boss to renounce his American citizenship and leave the country forever in exchange for his nemesis's legal services, stating that any attempt to continue their vendetta would be an insult to the memory of the good woman Vanessa had once been.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #93. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Fisk is later seen at her grave where he breaks down emotionally. She has since been talking to Wilson as a ghostly vision taunting him that he will never regain his former glory, an indication that her death still greatly affects him.{{issue|date=June 2015}}

The Arbiters bring Vanessa back as a [[revenant]] as apart of a test intended to gauge the Kingpin's worth as the head of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #7|date = 17 July 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt; Reluctant to combat his wife, Fisk tries to appeal to whatever humanity that she may still have left in her, and kills her when she still flings her weapons at him, unaware that she was actually aiming at the assassin who was approaching him from behind.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Zeb Wells|penciller = Joe Madureira|inker = Joe Madureira|colorist = Peter Steigerwald|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Jeanine Schaefer and Stephen Wacker|title = Savage Wolverine|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = 18 September 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] &quot;reanimates&quot; Vanessa in an attempt to coerce the Kingpin into allying with him in ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]''. The Kingpin responds by snapping Vanessa's neck while declaring, &quot;That wasn't my wife. That was an abomination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Javier Garron|inker = Javier Garron|colorist = Frank D'Armata|letterer = VC's Joe Caramagna|editor = Nick Lowe|story = King's Ransom|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 4|issue = #19|date = 5 October 2016|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In the Marvel/DC crossover book ''[[Batman &amp; Spider-Man: New Age Dawning]] #1'', Vanessa is infected with terminal cancer by [[Ra's al Ghul]], who offers the Kingpin the cure for it in exchange for his help in a plot that will destroy New York. Disgruntled under Ra's, the Kingpin forms an alliance with Spider-Man and [[Batman]] and succeeds in defeating Ra's, only to be denied the cure for his wife's cancer by the beaten eco-terrorist. Vanessa is cured near the end of the storyline by an antidote provided by Ra's al Ghul's daughter [[Talia al Ghul]], who recognizes Vanessa as a kindred spirit, as both of them loved a man that society would regard as a monster.

In the alternate universe of ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', it is revealed that she was not infected or eaten when the zombies took over the world. but has been secretly kept alive by her zombified husband, who is able to control his hunger for human flesh when she is around, but when the Kingpin's clone factory is destroyed by [[Machine Man]], and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], he consumes Vanessa.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2 (2008). Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanessa Fisk appears as an important background character in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. The Kingpin seeks the [[Tablet of Time]], as it alleged to have powers that Kingpin hopes may awaken Vanessa from a coma. but it is stolen by the [[Black Cat (comics)#Ultimate Black Cat|Black Cat]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p). ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #50 and 53. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after Kingpin sets fire to Daredevil's law office, Daredevil breaks into Fisk's home and threatens to murder the comatose Vanessa, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Fisk orders Vanessa to be taken out of the country before he is arrested himself over the attempted murder of [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #110. Marvel Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Punisher Max]]'' series, set in Marvel's [[Max (comics)|MAX]] universe, Vanessa is married to the Kingpin, but their marriage collapses as Wilson Fisk's takeover of the mob causes the death of their eight-year-old son Richard. Vanessa blames Wilson for not preventing Richard's death, and after she attempts unsuccessfully to kill him for this, he evicts her from their home. Later, in order to protect himself from [[Punisher|the Punisher]], Kingpin hires [[Elektra (comics)#PunisherMax|Elektra]] as a bodyguard. It is revealed that Elektra was actually hired by Vanessa, who is plotting the Kingpin's downfall, and that the two women are lovers. After the Kingpin is killed by the Punisher in issue #21, Vanessa has his body cremated and flushes his ashes down a toilet. She appears ready to take charge of her husband's former empire, as her chauffeur calls her &quot;Madam Kingpin&quot;. But in issue #22, she is ambushed and killed by [[Nick Fury]].

== Development ==

=== Casting ===
Casting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Isabelle auditioned on the same day as Perkins at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. Screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters when their taped auditions had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/10/26/ginger_snaps/index.html|title=Ginger Snaps|last=Taylor|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2001|work=salon.com|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''What Culture'' said:

: &quot;Obsessed with death and morbidity, and afraid of adulthood, Ginger Fitzgerald, portrayed by Katharine Isabelle of American Mary fame, only gets worse when shes bitten by a lycanthrope and the transformation into a wolf begins. She gradually becomes aggressive and over-sexualised, loses her relationship with her sister, grows pointy teeth and sprouts hair in really weird places. She even grows a tail that she actually attempts to cut off. It takes a big set of cojones to try to cut off any body part. Ultimately though, the film is interesting because it examines the dichotomy between Gingers humanity and her animalistic side.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-badass-female-horror-villains?page=5|title=10 Badass Female Horror Villains|last=|first=|date=|website=What Culture|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica Roakes of ''The Toast'' also mentions the metaphorical nature of the character saying &quot;Ginger’s body has betrayed her by menstruating. This is a key tenant of the body-horror genre — the monstrous comes not just from the outside, but from within the human body, from infection or perversion or unwanted biological functions. In Ginger’s case, it is her metamorphosis from girl to woman that renders her monstrous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2014/10/29/ginger-snaps-menstrual-horror-movie-dreams/|title=Ginger Snaps: The Menstrual Horror Movie Of Your Dreams|last=|first=|date=|website=The Toast|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trevor Fitzroy''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]], in particular [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]. Created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Whilce Portacio]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #281 (October 1991).

Fitzroy hails from the same [[dystopia]]n future as Bishop. A mutant criminal, he possesses the ability to absorb energy from human beings and use that energy to open [[time travel|time portals]], which is how Bishop traveled to the present. He has since been featured as the main adversary in the series featuring Bishop.

==Fictional character biography==
===The future===
Trevor Fitzroy was the illegitimate son of Anthony Shaw, Black King of [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], in a dystopian future. Fitzroy joined the '''Academy for [[Xavier's Security Enforcers]]''' (XSE) and had a relationship with [[Shard (comics)|Shard]]. He turned out to be a criminal, though, and was removed from the Academy. His wealthy father tried to protect his son for a while, but when Fitzroy was caught for murder, even he could no longer protect him. Fitzroy was captured and arrested by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], Shard's brother and an XSE officer. 

Fitzroy himself thought that he was merely a teleporter, but a secret group of XSE agents, known as the '''Xavier's Underground Enforcers''' (XUE) discovered that Fitzroy had the ability to travel through time. The XUE recruited Shard and freed Fitzroy, hoping to use his powers to change the past to create a better present.  However, Shard, reminded how dangreous Fitzroy was, stopped them and Fitzroy was returned to prison.

===The Upstarts===
From prison, Fitzroy escaped to the present time with his mutant minion [[Bantam (comics)|Bantam]]. There, he became involved with a group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a competition set up by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] to eliminate her rivals within the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Led by the Gamesmaster, the Upstarts had to kill other mutants to receive points. The Upstart with the most points would win the prize: control over the Hellfire Club and the other competitors. To enter the competition, one had to kill a member of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle (though later members didn't have to.) 
As part of this “game,” Fitzroy unleashed [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] and their leader [[Donald Pierce]]. All were killed except Pierce, who escaped and arrived at the Hellfire Club, followed by the Sentinels. The Sentinels killed Pierce (later rebuilt) and then killed most of the [[Hellions]], put their leader, [[Emma Frost]], into a coma and apparently killed Jean Grey (who had actually switched her mind with Frost). The [[X-Men]], who had been negotiating with Frost, fought Fitzroy. Fitzroy was forced to open a large time portal, allowing prisoners from his own time to escape to the present. The prisoners attacked the X-Men, but stopped when three figures stepped through the portal: Bishop and fellow XSE agents Randall and Malcolm. They went after Fitzroy, eventually killing the escaped criminals. However, Malcolm and Randall were killed, and Bishop remained in the present, joining the X-Men.

Fitzroy turned on Selene and captured her, though she later managed to escape. He also brought in [[Siena Blaze]] to compete in the Upstart competition. Fitzroy clashed with the X-Men a second time when he tried to kill [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], but managed to escape again. When the Gamesmaster declared that the new target for the Upstart competition would be former members of the [[New Mutants]] and Hellions, Fitzroy attacked [[X-Force]], demanding they turn over [[Rictor]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. X-Force leader [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] tricked Fitzroy into trying to absorb his life-energy, but as Cable's arm wasn't organic, Fitzroy's powers used his own life-energy to open a portal, seemingly killing him.

===After the Upstarts===
How he survived its left unknown, but Fitzroy eventually reappeared under the thrall of Selene as the White Rook of the Hellfire Club. During this time he cooperates with Pierce and Shaw, despite his previous attempts to kill them. He leaves the Club and travels back to an alternate future (Earth-9910), now calling himself the '''Chronomancer'''. He takes control over this new timeline, but Bishop arrives and fights Fitzroy, eventually killing him.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===X-Factor===
A younger version appears that is a participant in the Summers Rebellion. Here, he is shown to be a good guy. After Cortex kills him during a fight, [[Layla Miller]] resurrects him physically but is unable to revive him with a soul, establishing the point at which he becomes a villain.&lt;ref&gt;X-Factor' vol.3 #46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Fitzroy possessed the mutant ability to drain others of their life forces, converting it into energy and absorbing it into himself. With these energies, Fitzroy could create portals that could teleport those passing through them across time and space, yet, the portals are one way, trying to pass through the wrong way results in the traveler having his body terribly misshapen. He often was dependent on the mutant Bantam to direct and catalog the time-portals he made, lacking the ability to do so himself.

Fitzroy also can use the converted life force he drains to infuse on the dead that essentially resurrect them, however due to his nature, its an ability he rarely uses.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' (1st series) #17&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early appearances, Fitzroy wears a futuristic battle-armor that increases his strength and protects him from opponents. This battle armor was destroyed by the X-Men and a second suit of armor was destroyed by X-Force.
Fitzroy also had several [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obeyed his commands. These Sentinels were smaller than the 20th century type, but had the ability to repair themselves using material from their near vicinity.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Trevor Fitzroy &amp; Bantam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Trever Fitzroy and Bantam from [[X-Men Animated Series]]]]
Fitzroy was a guest-star in the two-part episode &quot;One Man's Worth&quot; of the episodes of the mid-’90s [[X-Men animated series|''X-Men'' animated series]]. Fitzroy, known as &quot;the Mutant Traitor&quot;, under the orders of [[Master Mold]], travels back in time to 1959 to murder Charles Xavier. In the cartoon, he does not kill those whose energy he absorbs, but knocks them unconscious for a few days.

===Video Games===
Fitzroy was one of the bosses in ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy]]''.  Defeating him allows [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to be a playable character.

'''James Ford''', better known by the alias &quot;'''Sawyer'''&quot; and later as &quot;'''Jim LaFleur'''&quot;, is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Josh Holloway]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.

Sawyer was born on 18 February 1968; he was initially portrayed as a conniving, sarcastic handsome flirt who keeps stashes of washed-ashore items. His flashbacks typically depict a more sensitive side to him, juxtaposed against acts of betrayal and theft. He has a romantic interest in the fugitive [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]), and the two fall in love over the series. Their relationship is particularly prominent in the beginning of the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]] he develops a more heroic side, becoming protective of [[Claire Littleton]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and sacrificing his chance to escape so his friends can in the [[There's No Place Like Home|season finale]]. In the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]], Sawyer quickly acclimates to his new role as group leader as they are sent back through time, and after being without Kate for three years, falls in love with [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]), creating a love triangle when Kate returns to the island. Sawyer is the show's primary [[anti-hero]].

==Character biography==

===Prior to the crash===
Sawyer was born in [[Jasper, Alabama]] in 1968 as James Ford. When James was nine years old, his parents were conned by a man under the alias of &quot;[[Characters of Lost#Anthony Cooper|Tom Sawyer]]&quot;; as a result, his father killed both his mother and himself.  On the day of the funeral, [[Characters of Lost#Jacob|Jacob]] expresses his condolences to Sawyer, even as he is writing his 'I am going to find you' letter for the conman who took his family. At the time of his parents' death, James and his family were living in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] according to the letter Sawyer carries. James also claims to have dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but has a &quot;high school transcript.&quot; A major driving force in James' life is his vow to avenge his parents' deaths by hunting down the original Sawyer; as an adult, when he found himself in financial difficulty, he adopted the profession and alias of the man responsible for his parents' death, using his looks and charm to seduce wealthy married women, thus he &quot;became the man he was hunting.&quot; One of his scams involved waking up next to his victim and pretending to be late for an important meeting; as he rushes to get ready, his briefcase will &quot;accidentally&quot; spill open, revealing bundles of cash the woman &quot;wasn't supposed to see.&quot; With her interest piqued, he convinces her and her spouse to invest cash in a legally questionable, but supposedly lucrative business opportunity, before disappearing with the money. On one occasion, he runs this con up until he discovers the targeted couple has a child, experiences an attack of conscience and cancels the deal.

On another occasion, Sawyer carries out a &quot;[[Confidence trick|Long con]]&quot; (large-scale con) on a divorced woman named [[Characters of Lost#Cassidy Phillips|Cassidy]] who is known to be less gullible than his usual victims. He sets up the usual con and spills his cash over the ground, only this time with fake bank notes. Cassidy realizes he's trying to con her from the moment he spills the money, and tells him  his con wouldn't have worked  because she received no money after the divorce. Instead of being mad, however, she asks him to teach her his profession. After learning a few basic tricks, Cassidy soon asks Sawyer to pull off a long con. He tells her such a con requires money, and she reveals she actually received $600,000 from her ex-husband. He pretends to begin a long con, using her money to set it up, but in fact he simply plans to take the money. However, she has begun to grow on him, and he wavers on his con. While visiting the diner of [[Kate Austen|Kate]]'s mother, his partner (played by [[Kevin Dunn]]) forces Sawyer to resume his con on threat of death. He goes back to Cassidy and tells her that he has been conning her, and warns her of a car parked outside. He stuffs the money into a bag and tells her to leave with it, and he will take the blame. When she runs off, he takes the real money (having given her fake bank notes) and returns to the car, actually empty.

Cassidy presses charges against Sawyer for conning her, and he is sent to prison. Cassidy visits him and informs him they have a daughter, named Clementine. While in prison, Sawyer befriends a man named Munson, sentenced for a [[white-collar crime]]. On behalf of the police, he cons Munson into revealing where he hid the money he stole; as a result, Sawyer's sentence is cut short, and the monetary reward he receives is deposited in an anonymous bank account for Clementine at his request. Later, as Sawyer is seducing another woman, another partner (played by [[Robert Patrick]]) informs him of the whereabouts of the original Sawyer who conned his parents. Sawyer travels to [[Australia]] to confront the man, and shoots him. Before he dies, Sawyer realizes his partner had conned him into killing someone who owed money to an important person. Sawyer also encounters and drinks with [[Christian Shephard]] at a bar. While in Australia, Sawyer is arrested, at the same station visited by [[Boone Carlyle|Boone]], for assaulting [[Warren Truss]], an Australian politician and leader of the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]], during a bar fight. As a result, Sawyer is deported and banned from returning to Australia; he leaves on board [[Oceanic Flight 815]], his seat number being 15D.

===After the crash===

====Season One====

Upon crashing on the island, Sawyer almost instantly clashes with the other survivors. He initially accuses [[Sayid Jarrah|Sayid]] of being the terrorist who caused the crash. Despite this, he joins Sayid, along with [[Kate Austen|Kate]], [[Charlie Pace|Charlie]], [[Boone Carlyle|Boone]] and [[Shannon Rutherford|Shannon]] on a hike to send out a distress signal. Upon returning, Sawyer searches the plane wreck for anything and everything he can find and keeps them for himself, causing the other survivors to bargain with him for items. He and [[Jack Shephard|Jack]] clash over the attention of Kate on regular intervals. Kate claims to see through his attempts to make people hate him, until he shows her the letter he wrote but implies it was written to him by one of his victims; later she sees the date on the envelope and realizes he wrote the letter himself. After Jack is caught in a cave-in, Sawyer locates Kate in the jungle and eventually informs her. When Shannon experiences asthma attacks, Sawyer is immediately under suspicion of possessing her inhalers after Boone sees him with one of his belongings. After being interrogated by Sayid, he tells Kate that he doesn't have them, causing an enraged Sayid to stab him in the arm. Kate then confronts Sawyer regarding his selfish actions, and tells him to change his ways by cooperating more with the survivors.  He reluctantly agrees.

In the jungle, Sawyer and Kate discover a case, carried on the plane by the Marshall, and the two constantly fight over its ownership, until Jack takes it from Sawyer.  Soon after, Sawyer becomes constantly harassed by a boar, and seeks Kate's help in finding it. Upon cornering it, however, Sawyer decides to let it go. After learning about [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael]]'s plan to build a raft, Sawyer asks for a place on board, to which he is granted. However, after someone (later revealed as [[Walt Lloyd|Walt]]) sets the raft on fire, Sawyer and Michael blame [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin]] and Sawyer takes him to the beach with the intent of beating him. Once the matter is solved, Sawyer experiences headaches and, after consulting Jack, is prescribed reading glasses, made from pairs found in the wreckage. His voice also calms the newborn of survivor [[Claire Littleton|Claire]].

The day before the raft sets sail, Sawyer and Kate clash once more, this time over his place on the raft. While Kate placed a good argument, Sawyer revealed his past life as a criminal to the survivors, securing his space on the raft. The next day, Sawyer, Michael, Walt and Jin set sail on the raft. When a piece of the raft breaks off, Sawyer is the first in the water to retrieve and re-attach it. He also begins reading through the survivors' personal messages,  kept in a bottle. That night, they encounter a small boat and begin celebrating their rescue. However, they soon reveal themselves as the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], and demand they hand over Walt. In an attempt to prevent Walt's abduction, Sawyer is shot in the shoulder before the raft is destroyed by the Others, who leave with Walt.

====Season Two====
Sawyer and Michael are stranded at sea with the wreckage of the raft. Sawyer removes the bullet from his shoulder prior to arriving back on the island, encountering the tail section survivors from the plane and being thrown into a pit. Once the mishap is cleared, Sawyer, Michael and Jin are released and forced into leading them to the fuselage camp. Throughout the journey, Sawyer constantly clashes with leader [[Ana Lucia Cortez|Ana Lucia]], until he passes out from his bullet wound. He is then carried via hand-made stretcher until the death of Shannon, where he is carried by [[Mr. Eko]] into the hatch. He is cared for by Kate, until her father, Wayne, is channeled through Sawyer. Upon recovering, Sawyer reluctantly must seek Jack's medical expertise on a regular basis. 

On one such occasion, Sawyer releases Jack and Locke from the armory after Michael locks them in to search for Walt alone. Sawyer agrees to join them as they follow, only to encounter the Others. After revealing to have Kate held hostage, Sawyer, Jack and Locke reluctantly hand over their guns for her safety. Unlike Jack, Sawyer sympathizes with Kate's actions. Soon after, Sawyer sets up a long con, with the help of Charlie, in order to gain possession of the camp's entire firearms and medicine, using [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun]] as a victim of a faked abduction attempt. Upon succeeding this feat, Sawyer is challenged by Jack to a game of poker with the medicine as the prize, which Jack wins. Sawyer later gives Sun a pregnancy test upon request, and informs [[Bernard Nadler|Bernard]] and Jin about her suspected pregnancy.

Sawyer also uses his possession of the medicine to his advantage, and mocks [[Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes|Hurley]] when he admits to seeing things, only for his tirade to backfire. He also refuses to help Bernard create an S.O.S. sign on the beach. He is soon confronted by Ana Lucia, demanding he give her a gun. She seduces him, and steals his own gun from him. Upon discovering this, Sawyer, along with Jack, Locke and Kate, head for the hatch, where they discover Michael injured, [[Libby (Lost)|Libby]] fatally wounded and Ana Lucia already dead. Michael asks Sawyer if he will go with him to the Others' camp, to which he agrees. After the funeral of Ana Lucia and Libby, Sawyer joins Michael, Jack, Kate and Hurley on the trek, where they are suddenly ambushed by the Others, tied up and taken to a pier. While Michael (along with Walt) leave the island, and Hurley is released, Sawyer is taken away by the Others, along with Jack and Kate.

====Season Three====
Sawyer wakes in the Others' camp, imprisoned in a cage originally designed to hold polar bears. Karl, a teenager being held in the cage across from Sawyer's, helps Sawyer to figure out the mechanism in his cage so he can gain access to food and water. Karl then helps him to escape, but Juliet shoots Sawyer in the neck with a tranquilizer dart and he is returned to his cage. Karl is taken away, and Kate is placed in the cage vacated by Karl. Sawyer and Kate are forced to mine and haul rocks for the Others. During this manual labor, Sawyer kisses Kate, even though he gets beaten for it by Danny Pickett.  Pickett, one of the Others, dislikes Sawyer, blaming him for the death of his wife. 

Sawyer and Kate concoct an escape plan, but they are prevented from acting on it when Sawyer is knocked unconscious by Ben.  The Others operate on Sawyer, implanting a pacemaker which will malfunction and kill him if his heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute.  He is told if he does not cooperate, Kate will be given a pacemaker too.  Because of this, Sawyer does not defend himself when Pickett violently beats him up. Later, Sawyer nearly dies (supposedly) after Kate turns her back to him in her cage and starts undressing. Sawyer sees this and his pacemaker beats rapidly. Kate asks him what this sound is and Sawyer lies, saying that it is his watch and tells her to 'put some clothes on'. 

Kate realizes she can slip out between top bars of her cage, but Sawyer refuses to escape with her. Instead of fleeing on her own, she returns to her cage.  Later, Ben reveals to Sawyer that he has been conned, and there is no pacemaker in his heart.  Ben informs Sawyer they are on a smaller island, separated by a stretch of open ocean from the island on which their plane crashed. Sawyer realizes how inescapable the island is, and is returned to his cage.

Kate opens Sawyer's cell but Sawyer again refused to leave, knowing how futile it would be to try. They have sex, and while Ben is unconscious, having a tumor removed by Jack, Pickett takes the opportunity to finally kill Sawyer. However, Jack threatens to let Ben die unless Kate and Sawyer are released. Sawyer turns the tables on Pickett, beats him up, and he and Kate escape.  Alex Rousseau helps them hide in the jungle in return for freeing Karl (her boyfriend), and gives them a canoe to escape in. Right before they leave the beach, Pickett finally catches up with them, but is shot dead by Juliet, who Ben ordered to help them escape.

Back on the main island, Sawyer and Kate argue over his decision to leave Jack behind (and also to let Karl go free). At the survivors' camp, Sawyer keeps his distance from Kate and has a beer-fueled joyriding session with Hurley, Jin, and Charlie in an abandoned Dharma truck Hurley found in the jungle. Back at camp he discovers Kate has gone off with Sayid and Locke in order to rescue Jack. He and Hurley develop a friendship, often playing table tennis together.  Hurley surprises Sawyer by announcing with Jack, Locke, Kate, and Sayid gone, the rest of the survivors are looking to Sawyer to lead them. Sawyer rises to the challenge and bonds with the other survivors.  When Kate and Jack finally return, Sawyer is outraged they have brought Juliet along. He and Sayid attempt to get information on the Others out of her, but they ultimately fail. 

Sawyer resumes his relationship with Kate but suspects she is using him to make Jack jealous. One night Locke tells Sawyer that he has captured Ben, and takes Sawyer to the ''Black Rock'', locking him in a room with a bound and gagged stranger.  This man, not Ben, reveals  he is Anthony Cooper (Locke's father), a conman who also goes under the name &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot; Sawyer realizes this is the man whom he has been searching for and, after Cooper mocks his letter of vengeance, Sawyer strangles him to death in a fit of anger. With no more use for the nickname &quot;Sawyer,&quot; he begins to call himself James again, though others continue to refer to him as Sawyer. Locke presents him with a tape showing Juliet is still working for Ben, and the Others are preparing a raid on the survivors. When Sawyer shows the tape to Jack at their camp, Jack reveals he knows about the raid, and Juliet has been working with him to double-cross the Others. 

Sawyer and several survivors hike across the jungle to the radio tower, but Sayid, Jin, and Bernard stay behind to thwart the Others and end up captured.  Sawyer decides to go back with Juliet to rescue them.  With the help of Hurley and the Dharma truck, their rescue is a complete success. Two of the Others are killed and the third, Tom, is captured before Sawyer shoots him out of vengeance for 'taking the kid off the raft.'

====Season Four====
When Desmond breaks news about Charlie's death, Sawyer attempts to comfort Hurley, though his efforts are rejected. Although originally unsure of the meaning of Charlie's dying message, &quot;Not Penny's Boat,&quot; when the survivors split Sawyer chooses to go with Locke to the Barracks, telling Kate he was simply doing what he's always done: surviving. While holding Kate hostage in Ben's house on Locke's orders, Sawyer tells Kate he doesn't wish to return to the real world, seeing as he has nothing for him back there. He then proceeds to tell Kate she should do the same, and that they could try to start a life on the island. Kate and Sawyer sleep together but she leaves after Sawyer is relieved that she isn't pregnant, reasoning that they wouldn't be able to handle a baby. They have an argument and part on bad terms as Kate returns to the beach. Later on, a group of people from the boat arrive at the barracks to capture Ben. Ben, Locke, Hurley and Aaron take refuge in Ben's house and they barricade the door. Sawyer runs to retrieve Claire who is still sleeping alone in her house and watches in horror as it is blown up by the Freighters. He finds Claire alive under the ruins and proceeds to run back to Ben's house. After Alex is murdered by Keamy and Ben unleashes the smoke monster on the attackers, Sawyer decides to go back to Jack and the others on the beach. Claire, Aaron and Miles go with him. Hurley was going to go with Sawyer as well, but Locke, pointing a gun at Sawyer, forces Hugo to stay with him. After Sawyer warns Locke not to hurt &quot;a single hair on his [Hugo's] curly head,&quot; he leads the rest of the group back to the beach. 

Sawyer, Claire and Miles soon come across the bodies of Danielle and Karl. After leaving the area, they decide to settle down to make camp, however during the night Claire takes off into the jungle. Sawyer wakes up the following morning and Miles tells him Claire walked into the jungle in the middle of the night with someone she called &quot;Dad&quot;. A short while later he hears Aaron crying and runs off to find him alone in the jungle. Sawyer and Miles, along with Aaron, continue on where they meet Jack and Kate in a small field. Jack and Kate were in the process of moving towards the helicopter from the freighter, with Jack inadvertently thinking the dropped satellite phone from Frank was a message to follow the crew. Sawyer then informs Jack and Kate that Claire walked off and the freighter's crew are up to no good.  He hands Aaron over to Kate and tells her to go back to the beach with Miles and the infant, while he insists on going with Jack to face Charles Widmore's men.  The two then find the helicopter, discover Frank handcuffed to the seats, and are told the men are heading towards Ben. Sawyer then tells Jack that Hurley is with Ben and the two head off to rescue Hurley.

Jack and Sawyer eventually find Hurley and Locke at the [[Dharma_Initiative#Station_6:_The_Orchid|Dharma Orchid station]]. After Jack finishes talking with Locke, Sawyer and Hurley meet up with Kate, Sayid, and Frank at the helicopter. En route to the freighter Frank notices that the helicopter is quickly losing fuel due to a bullet hole in the gas tank. The passengers ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load, but Frank declares it will not be enough. Sawyer whispers something to Kate, he gives her a goodbye kiss, and he then bails out of the helicopter to give the others a chance of escape. Sawyer swims back to the Island and encounters Juliet, who directs his attention to smoke coming from the ruins of the freighter. As the two lie on the beach drinking rum they disappear with the vanished Island.

===After the Island===

After the [[Characters_of_Lost#Oceanic_Six|Oceanic Six]] (Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun, Sayid and Aaron) leave the Island, flashforwards in &quot;[[Something Nice Back Home]]&quot; reveal Kate is doing undisclosed favors for Sawyer, who, according to Jack, &quot;chose to stay on the island&quot;.

===Season Five===

====After the flash====

Before the strange flash, James and Juliet meet up with Charlotte, Miles, Rose, Bernard and the other 815 survivors and they discover  their camp is somehow missing. James is then introduced to [[Daniel Faraday]], who tells him the camps are not gone but that it hasn't been built yet and whatever Ben did in the Orchid station has made them constantly shift through time. They are in the past. The group set out to find a man-made landmark on the Island to determine where they are in time. After several more flashes, the team decide to head back to the beach. At the beach, they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows, resulting in several casualties. The group ultimately splits up, with James and Juliet heading toward the creek together. There they are attacked by three strangers.  They demand answers, and even threatens to cut off Juliet's hand to emphasize their impatience, when Locke arrives to kill one and injure the other two.  James, Juliet, and Locke question the two attackers and Juliet discover they are Others when they speak Latin to each other. They arrive at a camp where [[Others (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] is leading his people and he has Charlotte, Daniel and Miles held captive. The year is 1954. When an Other called [[Characters of Lost|Ellie]] takes Daniel at gunpoint to try to disarm a hydrogen bomb called Jughead, James holds a gun at her in order to rescue him. He then discovers Daniel had told Ellie  they are from the future and are not part of the American military which the Others had believed they were. Suddenly, there is yet another flash and the Others including Ellie and Richard disappear. James and the rest see Charlotte bleed from her nose and collapse.
[[File:WhateverHappenedLost.jpg|thumb]]
James watches as Juliet and Daniel attempt to wake up Charlotte, who eventually comes around.  James and Locke decide to head to the Orchid Station, believing a way to stop the jumps is there. When they return to the beach they discover the camp is back but has been abandoned and they also find a rowing boat on which they decide to use to get to the Orchid. However whilst rowing they are attacked by unknown assailants from behind - Juliet manages to shoot one of the attackers but before anything else can happen there is another flash.  The assailants are gone, and they are rowing in the rain. Later on, the team is reunited with Jin, last seen in [[There's No Place Like Home|the season four finale]], who is alive. Along with Jin the team then continue on to Orchid where the flashes become worse and becomes painful for all the castaways and not just Charlotte. James, Juliet and Miles get headaches and bleeding noses but it becomes too much for Charlotte who once again falls to the ground. The shifts are slowly but surely killing them. Daniel decides to stay behind with her and the rest continue to the Orchid. They arrive to find only a well, which evidently leads to the wheel. Locke will stop the time flashes, and as he lowers himself, James and the others bid him good-bye. Just then, another flash engulfs the Island, forcing James to try to grasp Locke's hand, but to no avail. Once the flash is passed, the well is not even existent. In a frenzy, James starts digging at the ground, but Juliet tells him Locke is gone.

====1974====

Locke then goes into a cave and turns the crank, which Ben originally turned, and the island stops moving through time. James, Juliet, Miles and Jin head back to Daniel, who informs them Charlotte has died due to violent shifts through time. As they all head back to the beach they hear the sound of gunshots and a woman screaming. Approaching the source of the commotion they see two men holding a woman hostage with a bag over her head after just killing her male companion. James and Juliet aim their guns at the men and tell them to stand down but when one of the men takes a shot at James both he and Juliet kill the men in self-defense. James releases the woman, who introduces herself as Amy. She tells them they need to bury the men they killed and to take her husband's body back to her people in order to keep a truce. As the team and the woman called Amy trudge back, they approach a sonic fence. Amy appears to turn off the machine and walk through it without being harmed. However James, Juliet, Daniel, Miles and Jin walk through and are all knocked unconscious. Amy is revealed to be wearing earplugs. 

James later wakes up in a house on a couch.  A man named Horace Goodspeed ([[Doug Hutchison]]) demands to know who he and his friends are. Being a slick con-man, he lies and tells Horace his name is Jim LaFleur and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island. Horace, believing his story, tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that James and his friends must be on it. James asks if he could search for his &quot;other friends,&quot; but his plea is denied. It appears Horace and Amy are part of the DHARMA Initiative.  Later that night, Richard Alpert enters the Barracks, DHARMA's homes, to demand where his two men, the ones James killed, are buried.  James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to Richard alone. He explains to Richard he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with John Locke, who had met Richard a few years prior during an earlier flash. He gives the flustered Richard information able to fully convince the latter. James also tells Richard that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense; Richard however tells him his people are livid and want some justice; Amy agrees to give Richard the body of Paul, her husband, in order to keep the truce. The agreement is made; Richard leaves. It appears the present time is 1974, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative's presence on the Island. Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce, stating they must respect their own privacy on the Island. A relieved and obliged Horace kindly informs James he and his fellow survivors can stay on the Island for two more weeks in order to search for his friends (Locke), before boarding the next submarine off the Island. James and Juliet share a quiet moment at the dock, the latter telling the former her longing to leave the Island is at its peak. She wants to leave on the next submarine, but James reminds her she has nothing to go back to, since they are thirty years back. Juliet consents to staying.

====1977====

Three years pass, and James is still on the Island along with his friends.  They are all working for DHARMA, and for the most part they are contented living at the Barracks, especially James, who shares a home with Juliet.  He is the head of security and an apparently trustworthy figure, using his alias “Jim LaFleur.” One morning, he receives a call from Jin regarding the return of Jack, Kate, and Hurley, having returned to the Island and to the past. Stunned, he goes out to meet them at a grassy field far from the Barracks, and there he tells them of his position within DHARMA and the present time of 1977. Kate's return makes him realize that despite being apart for 3 years and having fallen for Juliet, he is still in love with Kate, and becomes torn between her and Juliet. Likewise, Kate continues to be torn between Jack and Sawyer, and is jealous upon learning of Sawyer's relationship with Juliet. In order to smuggle them into DHARMA, Sawyer instructs the three to dress up in appropriate clothing and pretend to be new recruits for DHARMA so as to avoid awkward questions and the Hostiles, DHARMA’s name of choice for the Others.  Later Sayid, (last seen in [[316 (Lost)|316]]), who also traveled back in time, is caught in the jungle and is mistaken by DHARMA as a Hostile.  James is pressured to execute him for violating the code of truce between DHARMA and the Hostiles, but he has him locked in a cell and quietly contemplates a plan to free him.  

Sayid escapes a few days later with the help of eleven-year-old [[Benjamin Linus|Ben]].  After the former shoots the latter and runs off, Jin carries the boy back to the Barracks, where he is treated with minimal success at the infirmary.  James alerts Jack and pleads him to help, but his request is snubbed.  Eventually, James and Kate take the unconscious boy to the Others, believing they can provide the only cure.  After doing so, with the caveat Ben will never be the same again, James asks Miles through the surveillance camera at the border between DHARMA’s area and the Others’ territory to remove the tape containing footage of Ben being taken away.  The two return to the Barracks afterward.  James is alerted of Roger Linus’s, Ben’s father, suspicions, and begins to worry about what may come next.  Security staff member Phil ([[Patrick Fischler]]) confronts James and shows him the tape mentioned earlier, this proving Miles failed James’ order.  James knocks him out in response and keeps him tied up and gagged in the closet.  The next day, he holds a meeting with only the Oceanic Six survivors and Juliet and reluctantly tells them his comfortable life within DHARMA is ending, thanks to Jack, Kate, and Hurley.  He wants to return the beach and start over.  However, following the events in [[The Variable]], Radzinsky, an antagonistic engineer of DHARMA’s, discovers Phil in the closet and ties up James and Juliet in two chairs, furiously demanding answers. James refuses to comply, forcing Radzinsky to violently beat him, even with Horace pleading him not to.  When Dr. Pierre Chang ([[Francois Chau]]) disrupts the interrogation to order everyone to leave the Island because of impending danger, James requests the women and children get on the submarine and leave.  He also agrees to tell everyone everything on the condition he and Juliet also get spots on the sub.  An agreement is made; they get on board, James hoping never to turn back.  Unfortunately, Kate also gets on, informing him and Juliet of Jack’s intentions to detonate a hydrogen bomb which will decimate the Island and alter the past so Oceanic 815 will never crash twenty-seven years from now.  Very reluctantly, James agrees to help stop Jack, and the three secretly leave the sub and head back to the beach.  After briefly meeting up with [[Rose Henderson|Rose]] and [[Bernard Nadler|Bernard]] (last seen in [[The Lie (Lost)|The Lie]]) and leaving them, they confront Jack, Hurley, Sayid, Jin, and Miles.  James drags Jack to a secluded area and tells him that he, James, could have stopped [[List of Lost characters|Anthony Cooper]] from conning his parents and thus preventing their deaths a year ago, but asserts what is done is done, and Jack should do the same in his case.  When Jack rebuffs, they get into a fistfight which continued until Juliet intervenes.  Much to James’ vexation, Juliet agrees with Jack.  Juliet tells James she will never lose him if she does not know him.  

As Jack prepares to go to the constructing Swan Station to drop the bomb on the electromagnetic source, Phil and his men spot him and try to shoot him down.  James, Juliet, Kate, and Miles come to Jack’s aid, and an intense gunfight ensues.  DHARMA’s men are besieged, and James urges Jack to go ahead and discharge the bomb.  However, the bomb does not go off, and the electromagnetic source is activated, causing pandemonium.  Phil nearly kills James, but is stabbed dead by a [[rebar]] in the process.  Amidst the chaos, James spots Juliet falling in the chasm and in danger of getting sucked in.  He and Kate grasp her hands and he tells her to not to leave him, but the force becomes too strong, causing pain for all of them.  Juliet tells James she loves him and releases her clutch, dropping down to the bottom where she cannot be seen.  James sobs hysterically, not registering himself, even when Kate and Jack drag him back up.

===Season 6 ===

====2007====
In the premiere of season 6, James wakes up in the middle of the jungle and finds out he and the rest of the group traveled back to 2007. They discover the Swan imploded, just like they left it in 2004. James realizes the plan didn't work and Juliet died for no reason, and he beats Jack. They all fall into the hole where the hatch door was supposed to be, and Kate suddenly hears moaning coming from underneath the steel, which leads her to believe Juliet may still be alive. After removing all the pieces of metal, James climbs down and finds a heavily bleeding Juliet. She asks him to kiss her, and after doing so, Juliet dies in his arms. James buries her with Miles' help, but really wants him to implement his [[medium (communication)|medium]] skills to find out what Juliet's dying words were supposed to be. Miles says Juliet told him &quot;it worked,&quot; to which James pouts. Later, he and Miles are captured by the Others, but not before taking down several of them as Miles proclaimed. They are taken to the Temple, the Others' vicinity and only safe location from the Smoke Monster.  In his anger over Juliet's death, he tells the Others to do whatever they want with his friends, whom he proclaims are no longer his friends to this point, and leaves. Kate goes after him, following him back to the Barracks and what used to be his and Juliet's house. When James and Kate sit on the docks, he confesses he planned on asking Juliet to marry him, having a ring and all. He admits to Kate he should have let Juliet leave with the sub when she asked him to, back in 1974, but made her stay because he didn't want to be alone. He also tells Kate he doesn't blame her for Juliet's death. He throws the ring in the ocean and then leaves, telling Kate that he will not help her on her mission to find Claire.

He spends his time playing loud music from his record player and drinking. When the Smoke Monster shows up, in the form of [[John Locke (Lost)|Locke]], James is not entirely surprised about it, but suspects he is not Locke, judging by the way he talks. The Man in Black persuades him to follow him to a part of the Island to answer the most important question of all: &quot;Why is (James) on the Island?&quot; They then head off; James spots a boy in the jungle and the Man in Black is perturbed to know he can see him too.  While the Man in Black runs after the mysterious boy, James meets [[Richard Alpert|Richard]], who frantically asks him to come along to the Temple.  James refuses, and Richard, hearing the Man in Black coming back, runs off. They climb down a cliff to a cave. James sees a scale with a black stone and a white stone, the Man in Black throwing into the sea the latter. The Man in Black then shows James mysterious carvings on the cave ceiling; among them are the surnames of John, Hurley, James (himself), Sayid, Jack, and Sun. [[Mythology of Lost|The Numbers]] 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 correspond to a surname, for Locke, Reyes, Ford, Jarrah, Shephard and Kwon, respectively. James is informed Jacob picked and manipulated those people at various points in their lives to have them show up on the Island. James is a candidate to take up the mantle of leader of the Island; thus, he is given three choices: do nothing, become leader of the Island, or leave the Island with the Man in Black. James firmly chooses the third choice.

He follows the Man in Black to Claire's camp, Claire being a follower of the former. James agrees with Jin he will help look for Sun. The Man in Black then sends him to the other Island, dubbed &quot;Hydra Island&quot; to look for survivors of the Ajira Airways Flight 316. Arriving there, James greets Zoey ([[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]]), who tells him she is the remaining survivor. However, James learns she is lying and demands answers, until a cavalcade of armed men appear and escort him to their leader, [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]), who has returned on a submarine. James makes a deal with Widmore: he will lead the Man in Black into a trap in exchange for safe passage away from the island. He travels back to the main island and tells the Man in Black about the deal he made, stating he is loyal to the Man in Black. However, he later reveals his true plan to Kate: to turn both sides against each other and escape on the submarine while both sides are distracted. 

When the Man in Black leaves to recruit Sun, James tries to stop Jin from leaving camp, until a barrage of tranquilizers bring them down. Jin is taken away by Widmore's team, who has been spying on them, and James tries to remain calm as the situation reaches higher levels of strain. 

In the series finale, James escapes the island on an airplane piloted by [[Frank Lapidus]], along with [[Kate Austen]], [[Claire Littleton]], [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] and [[Miles Straume]].

===Afterlife===
After James' untold death at a later date, he appears in the alternate timeline in 2004. James is on the plane along with the rest of the passengers and has a conversation with Hurley. He somewhat flirts with Kate, a fugitive again, escorted by Edward Mars. Later on, after the plane lands, James and Kate share an elevator at the airport, him noticing the handcuffs around her wrists and realizing her criminal status. When security guards enter the elevator, James helps Kate escape them, knowing she's on the run.

As it turns out, James is actually a policeman from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]].  His partner is [[Miles Straume|Miles]].  However, his back story involving his parents' death at the hands of [[Characters of Lost|Anthony Cooper]] remains unchanged (as shown in his blind date with [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]]), and he is adamant on hunting Cooper down and killing him.  He had traveled to Australia to look for him, under the pretense he went to [[Palm Springs]], as he had told Miles.  However, Miles finds out the truth and threatens to sever their partnership unless James tells him about the trip to Australia.  Later, in his car James tells Miles everything, including his yearn to kill Cooper. Miles objects, but before James can respond, a car crashes into his and its driver runs off. The two cops pursue, and James apprehends the driver, [[Kate Austen|Kate]].

Along with Kate, James and Miles arrest Sayid, their only suspect in the killing of Martin Keamy and his men. [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun]] was shot during the battle and was included in the report. After [[Desmond Hume|Desmond]] runs over [[John Locke|Locke]] with his car and attacks [[Benjamin Linus|Ben]], he turns himself in to James. The three (Sayid, Kate and Desmond) are then told they are being transported to County Prison. Before the concert begins in the final episode, [[The End (Lost)|The End]], Miles sees Sayid in the passenger seat of Hurley's car. He notifies James, who then believes Sayid is after Sun, at the hospital. When James arrives, Sun and Jin are preparing to leave. He notifies them of the possibility of Sun being Sayid's target but they both re-assure him she is safe. Before they leave the hospital room, Jin tells James, &quot;We'll see you there&quot;, which leaves him confused. He leaves the room shortly after and bumps into Jack asking him if he knows where to get some food around here. Jack tells  him the cafeteria is closed but there are vending machines at the end of the corridor to which he responds, &quot;thanks Doc&quot;. A connection was seen between the two but nothing played out. The candy he chooses gets stuck so he tries to reach it using the tray at the bottom. Juliet arrives at the same moment and gives her advice to unplug the machine and the candy will fall. While unplugging the machine, there is a short and the entire room's electricity goes off. Juliet then tells him it worked and while handing him the candy, they both flash. They begin to recall the last few words they said to each other about getting coffee, and they touch again, which allows them to remember what occurred. They embrace, hug, and kiss and are later seen at the church with the other main characters.  James and Juliet move on to the next phase of the afterlife together, as soulmates.

== Personality ==

Sawyer is not initially liked by the other survivors due to his narcissistic personality, rude attitude, and his habit of calling everyone by offensive nicknames. He keeps a stash of such items as [[Whiskey]] and [[pornography]], which he had stolen from the wreckage.  He is manipulative of his fellow survivors. For example, he claimed to be in possession of [[Shannon (Lost)|Shannon's]] asthma medication and promised to hand it over for a kiss from Kate: it is revealed after the kiss that he never had the medication in the first place. It is also hard for him to work with other people, a quality essential for surviving on the island, and is quoted saying &quot;every man for himself&quot; when he is expected to help Jack escape from The Others in [[Lost (season 3)|season three]]. However, he grows more mature and caring in the later seasons, mostly because of his love for Kate, and, later, his own leadership role on the island and his relationship with Juliet. He shows his emotional side occasionally in the earlier seasons, too, especially in the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. He is very often depicted reading books, a habit that contrasts with his &quot;redneck&quot; side.

==Development==
Sawyer was originally a slick conman who wore a Prada suit. Midway through his audition for the role, Josh Holloway forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration. He managed to remember his lines after this and finished reading the monologue. The producers knew he didn’t suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, and kept the same intelligence he originally had. [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]], [[Jorge Garcia]] and [[Dominic Monaghan]] read Sawyer's lines when they came in to audition because there was no existing script for their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;&gt;&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;.  ''[[Lost (season 1)#DVD release|Lost: The Complete First Season]]'', [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].  September 6, 2005.  [[Featurette]], disc 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damon Lindelof]] has stated that Sawyer was written as a character whom audiences were supposed to care about even if his behavior was not sympathetic - &quot;He's an asshole, but he acts as an asshole because of the horrible things that happened to him as a kid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lost on Location - &quot;Confidence Man&quot;.  ''Lost: The Complete First Season - The Extended Experience'', [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].  [[Featurette]], disc 7.  Released on September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The character flashbacks would try to follow the same spirit of the character, &quot;a humorously engaging rascal — but who did have this sort of darkness to him&quot;, while showing what made  Sawyer &quot;a man who's hell-bent on revenge, like an [[Captain Ahab|Ahab]] model.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vox.com/a/lost-damon-lindelof-interviews/season-1-episode-6-house-of-the-rising-sun | title=The Lost interviews: 10 years later, Damon Lindelof talks about the show's first season | publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | accessdate=March 10, 2015 | author=VanDerWerff, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Adam Forsythe''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]''. He was played by [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]].

==Storylines==
Adam arrived, looking for a quiet life in Emmerdale, following his divorce. His first medical emergency from on his arrival was being alerted by [[Daz Eden]] ([[Luke Tittensor]]) that [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) was in labour while in [[Seth Armstrong]]'s ([[Stan Richards]]) hut.

Adam set up a clinic at the church hall and worked hard to gain the respect and admiration of his new neighbours. Working in the village and living at the B&amp;B, Adam was right at the heart of the community and soon won over pensioners [[Edna Birch]] ([[Shirley Stelfox]]) and [[Betty Eagleton]] ([[Paula Tilbrook]]) with his well-worn [[charm offensive]]. It wasn’t just the pensioners that loved the new [[General practitioner|GP]].

His living circumstances meant Adam started spending a lot of time with B&amp;B manager [[Steph Stokes]] ([[Lorraine Chase]]) – who was finally getting her life back on track after a traumatic year. From the offset there was a flicker of attraction between the pair and as they continued to live under the same roof as their relationship blossomed. But falling in love hadn’t been on Steph’s agenda – especially considering she’d never experienced real devotion before. However, Adam got her to trust him and soon she opened up about her traumatic childhood, confessing to him that her brother [[Terence Turner|Terence]] ([[Nick Brimble]]) had [[Child molestation|sexually abused]] her. Horrified by the revelations, Adam vowed to support Steph and appealed to her to tell her father [[Alan Turner (Emmerdale)|Alan]] ([[Richard Thorp]]) what had happened. However, as Steph and Adam were grappling with the fall out of her confession, Alan had got back in touch with Terence.

Upon arriving in Emmerdale, Terence was quick to deny Steph's claims – leaving only Adam believing her story. Life was hard for the couple as Terence continued to cast a shadow over their lives but a breakthrough came when the violent alcoholic admitted to Alan that he had abused Steph. Adam was delighted to see him driven out of Emmerdale and hoped for a quieter life. The problem was that Terence had no intention of going quietly and started digging around in the doctor’s past to find [[blackmail]] material. He didn’t have to dig too far, soon Terence discovered that Adam was not legally allowed to practice as a doctor after being struck off years before for assaulting a child. Backed into a corner, Adam started to panic and when he came home to find Terence in the B&amp;B cornering Steph, a struggle ensued. The violent altercation ended when Adam struck Terence over the head with a [[Fire extinguisher]] and killed him. He and Steph dragged the body to the woods and buried it.

Terrified she was going to confess all, Adam then whisked Steph away to [[Barbados]] and married her. The newlyweds returned to Emmerdale but it was clear Steph wasn’t coping so Adam felt forced to drug her to try to contain her growing paranoia – provoking suspicion in those close to them. But as hard as Adam tried to keep Steph quiet, he couldn't and when she spectacularly fell apart, he was forced to take drastic measures. Letting her confess to Alan, Adam then accompanied father and daughter to the woods where Steph offered to dig up Terence’s corpse. However, Adam had already moved it and Steph later found out that he moved Terence's body to under the Kings Show Home, (where it was discovered after the House Collapse) and she was left, looking mad. Realising he had double-crossed her, Steph went crazy and was promptly sectioned. Adam has proved that beneath the polished surface beats the heart of a calculating villain willing to go to any measures to stay afloat.

Adam left the village to escape what he thought was the inevitable exposing of his actions. The police discovered Terence's body. It emerged from the police that Adam was able to continue to illegally practice medicine, because his father, who had the same name and was also a doctor, died whilst abroad in Africa. Adam did not inform the authorities  (the [[General Medical Council|GMC]] and coroner's office) in the UK, but merely obtained and started using his dead father's Medical Registration documents. On 7 November, the day of Steph's trial, Adam was led to court in handcuffs to testify against his estranged wife who flew into a rage when she saw him after the court had adjourned for the day. After Steph falsely admitted to murdering Terence along with Adam, Adam committed suicide in prison, by hanging himself, and his body was found on 12 November.

The character and casting was announced on 4 August 2011. Taylor revealed she had found her first day on set &quot;terrifying&quot;, but she quickly settled in. A reporter for the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' branded Anne a &quot;pompous matriarch&quot;. Taylor said that after being revealed as Frank's killer, she fears that she will be hated in real life.

==Storylines==
Anne and Sam arrive to celebrate Frank's engagement to [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]). Following a car accident involving Frank and Carla, Anne and Sam go to the hospital to check Frank and Carla are okay.

Anne later returns to tells Carla that she will be taking over Frank's share of the business until Frank is cleared of raping Carla. Anne joins Frank at his new factory and is very pleased to hear that Carla has had a meltdown and fired the workers. [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) hears what Frank has done to Carla and goes to Frank's factory to bring everyone back to work at Underworld, angering Anne. Anne tries to persuade Carla to drop the charges in exchange for Frank's share of Underworld but Carla refuses and throws her out of her home. Anne goes on a cruise with Sam and a couple of days later she phones Frank and tells him his father has died. Anne comes home and initially struggles with her grief, blaming Carla for Sam's death and confronts her at the factory. Anne returns to work with Frank and [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) and they return to Underworld, alongside Carla and Michelle. Anne later learns that Frank is having an affair with [[Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) behind Sally's back and tells her so Frank then fires Anne and tells her to go home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Sally finally sees Frank's true colours|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a366275/sally-finally-sees-franks-true-colours.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne is devastated when Frank is found dead in the factory. She sees Frank's body being removed from Underworld and tells the police that she believes Carla killed Frank. She later notices the contract that gave Frank full ownership of Underworld is missing and accuses Carla of stealing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Peter cannot remember last night|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a367077/peter-cannot-remember-last-night.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally realises Frank's watch is missing and Anne assures her she will tell the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Sally uncovers a new clue|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369101/sally-uncovers-a-new-clue.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne attends Frank's funeral with Sally and apologises to Carla, which Carla finds suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Frank's funeral takes place|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369460/franks-funeral-takes-place.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later goes home alone and Sally visits her. She sees that Anne has Frank's watch and assumes that the police have returned it until Anne admits that she has had it all along. Sally realises that Anne killed Frank and tries to leave but trips and hits her head. Anne, however, calmly continues packing her bags until Carla arrives, wanting to know why Anne apologised earlier. Carla finds Sally and goes to call an ambulance, but Anne threatens her with a knife. Anne explains that she blamed Frank for Sam's death after overhearing Frank goading Carla about the rape. She went to the factory to get his watch back, but she struggles with Frank for it. When he pushed her away, she picked up a whiskey bottle and hit him. Carla then talks Anne into dropping the knife and she is later arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Frank's killer tries to flee|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a369462/franks-killer-tries-to-flee.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and casting==
Anne made her first on screen appearance on 4 September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/meetfranksparents/|title=Meet Frank's Parents|date=4 August 2011|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character and casting was announced on 4 August 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt; Taylor revealed she had found her first day on set &quot;terrifying&quot;, but she quickly settled in.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a344110/coronation-street-frank-will-be-protected-by-anne-says-gwen-taylor.html|title='Coronation Street' Frank will be protected by Anne, says Gwen Taylor|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 October 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was married to [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] (Paul Clayton) and is the mother of [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt; Of Anne and Sam, a show spokesperson said &quot;Sam and Anne are pretty full -on characters, like Frank. No sooner have they arrived than they're talking grandchildren which instantly freaks Carla out and tensions soon rise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fosters&quot;/&gt;

Taylor admitted in March 2012 that adjusting to the tight soap schedule was a challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' Gwen Taylor: 'I upped my game for Anne role'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a372831/coronation-street-gwen-taylor-i-upped-my-game-for-anne-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor said she was impressed with the acting skills of the regular cast, especially the one with children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot; /&gt; She commented: &quot;I'm going to remember the commitment that everyone had for the work. A lot of the women there had babies and young children, but everyone turned up on time and knew their lines - and I was so impressed by that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancel Interview&quot; /&gt; When signing to play Anne, Taylor had no idea that she would be playing a killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Corrie's Gwen Taylor: 'Andrew Lancel told me I was the killer'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a372131/corries-gwen-taylor-andrew-lancel-told-me-i-was-the-killer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=22 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress departed from ''Coronation Street'' in March 2012, after the conclusion to Frank's murder storyline.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt;

==Development==
After Frank's fiancé, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), accuses him of raping her and calls off the wedding, Anne supports her son.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt; She installs herself at Underworld to protect Frank's half of the business and makes Carla's life a misery.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt; Of Anne's support for Frank, Taylor said &quot;In Anne's eyes, Frank can do no wrong. She'll do whatever it takes to protect him. If he tells her he didn't do it, then he didn't do it. There are plenty of mums out there like that. When the recent riots happened, some women refused point blank to believe their children had been involved. So mums can be a pretty loyal bunch, for good or ill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AnneProtect&quot;/&gt;

In January 2012, it was announced that Frank would be killed in an upcoming &quot;whodunnit&quot; storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' confirms Frank Foster death plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a363873/coronation-street-confirms-frank-foster-death-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=22 March 2012|date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/891632-five-coronation-street-favourites-suspected-of-frank-fosters-murder|title=Five Coronation Street favourites suspected of Frank Foster's murder|date=28 February 2012|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank was found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; The ''Metro'' reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; Carla, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) and [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster|Kevin]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]), also fell under suspicion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Five&quot;/&gt; Anne was not listed among the characters, but Sarah Ellis of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' included Anne as an additional suspect during a feature on Frank's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|title=The prime suspects!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=3–9 March 2012|issue=9|pages=6–7|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis stated that Anne develops a motive for killing Frank after she discovers his true colours, despite believing he could do no wrong. Anne was devastated as she realised that she had got her son so wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Ellis pointed out that Anne played every inch the grieving mother and by blaming other people for her son's death, she could have been covering her own tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Ellis added that it must have been painful for Anne to realise that she had raised a monster, so maybe she decided to get rid of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Soap&quot; /&gt; Taylor said that after being revealed as Frank's killer, she feared that she would be hated in real life.&lt;ref name=Hated&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Jen|title=Corrie Anne: I'm most hated in Britain|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4205783/Corrie-Anne-Im-most-hated-in-Britain.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=News Group Newspapers|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to a reporter for ''TV Biz'' Taylor said that Anne had been the nastiest character she ever played.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; Taylor quipped that Anne had been very unkind and cruel towards Sally after she is revealed as killed Frank's killer.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; She added &quot;I hoped I'd get to play a character this evil one day.

Taylor also revealed people had also confronted her in public, having recognised her from the soap.&lt;ref name=Hated /&gt; Taylor admitted that she only knew the identity of Frank's killer when Lancel revealed it to her during filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; She explained &quot;It was strange, because I didn't know when I signed on that it was going to develop so brilliantly. But a little while after, Andrew was telling me that he was leaving at a certain point.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; Taylor also said she loved filming her &quot;showdown&quot; with Carla when she tries to call emergency services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Killer Casting&quot; /&gt; Speaking of Anne's situation, Taylor said &quot;A lot has happened to the poor woman, she's lost her husband then her son and stuck to her guns about his innocence.

'''Tory Foster''' is a [[fictional character]] from the 2004 TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', portrayed by [[Rekha Sharma]].

==Character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
Tory, like the other members of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The Final Five (Samuel Anders, Galen Tyrol, Tory Foster, Saul Tigh, Ellen Tigh)|Final Five]], was originally from a planet called [[Earth_in_science_fiction#Battlestar_Galactica|Earth]]. This Earth had been colonized by the 13th Tribe (composed of [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] from the planet [[Kobol]]) roughly 4,000 years before the events of the series (c.152,000 BC as revealed by the final episode). Tory and [[Galen Tyrol]] were in a relationship in their past lives - they lived together and planned to get married. Tory and the other members of the group that would later be known as the Final Five were working to recreate the resurrection process their Cylon ancestors used to employ on Kobol, a process that had fallen out of favor on Earth due to procreation. They had some advance knowledge of the impending destruction due to warnings from people no one else could see. The messenger that appeared to Tory looked like a man. When Earth was destroyed roughly 2,000 years ago the Final Five arranged to have themselves resurrected aboard a sub-light ship orbiting earth. They then left to find the Twelve Colonies and warn them about treating their artificial life with respect or face the same doom that befell Earth. By the time the Final Five completed their sublight journey thousands of years had passed, and they arrived near the end of the first Cylon/human war. Meeting the Cylon centurions, the Five offered to show them how to create humanoid cylon models in exchange for the centurions ending the war. The Final Five created eight models. However, the first model ([[John Cavil]]) destroyed the seventh model ([[Number Seven (Battlestar Galactica)|Daniel]]) out of fraternal envy. Cavil then killed the Final Five and boxed their minds for years, later resurrecting them in new bodies and reprogramming them to think they were humans from the Twelve Colonies. Presumably, he also reprogrammed the other Cylon models to not think about the Final Five or investigate their identities, and that to do so would constitute heresy.

In her new life, before [[the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies]], Tory was a precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi on Caprica for five years. In this capacity, she became an expert on [[opinion poll|polling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the nuclear attack on the Colonies she was driving down a road on Caprica and got hit by the force of a nuclear shockwave.  Her car was destroyed and she was injured, but she managed to survive the shockwave and was presumably picked up by a Raptor that landed nearby looking for survivors.

Following the death of [[Billy Keikeya]], Tory Foster becomes one of [[President]] [[Laura Roslin]]'s chief aides and advisors. She takes a particular responsibility for managing Roslin's election campaign. One of her first moves is to take an opinion poll, the results of which clearly show Roslin leading her presumptive opponent, [[Tom Zarek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt; She plays a part in finding a human foster mother for the half-Cylon child [[Hera Agathon]] and is one of the few people who know the child is alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downloaded&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Downloaded (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Downloaded| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She counsels Roslin during the Rya Kibby case, as she weighs up the consequences of appeasing the [[pro-life]] beliefs of the Gemenese and the need to repopulate the human race versus the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under Colonial law before the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt;

After Roslin's executive order criminalizes abortion throughout the fleet, [[Vice-President]] [[Gaius Baltar]] announces his candidacy in the forthcoming election, and garners Zarek's support as campaign manager (and eventual Vice-President&lt;ref name=&quot;Precipice&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Precipice (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Precipice| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The discovery of [[New Caprica]] and the Baltar-Zarek campaign's pro-settlement position swings much popular support away from Roslin. With Roslin's at first tacit, and later explicit, approval, Foster conspires with [[Colonel]] [[Saul Tigh]] and others to rig the election in Roslin's favour. The deception is discovered by [[Lieutenant]] [[Felix Gaeta]] on account of a typographical mistake on one set of ballot papers, and Baltar is sworn in as Roslin's successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lay Down Your Burdens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occupation of New Caprica by the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], Foster joins the human resistance movement, again serving as Laura Roslin's aide. She works to compile a list of known Cylon collaborators among the human population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Precipice&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupation&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Occupation| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helps to organize the swift and orderly evacuation of the civilian population to their assigned vessels, and is one of the last people to see [[Maya (Battlestar Galactica)|Maya]] and her adopted daughter [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera/Isis]] as the evacuation takes place. Despite having two bodyguards, Maya does not make it off New Caprica, Hera is captured by [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]], and Foster personally apologizes to Roslin for what she sees as her failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exodus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Roslin's second [[inauguration]] as President of the Twelve Colonies, Foster resumes her former duties as a presidential aide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collaborators&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Collaborators (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Collaborators| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few episodes of season 3, her mental condition starts deteriorating, and she starts hearing music. In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, &quot;[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]&quot;, she, along with [[Samuel Anders]], [[Saul Tigh]], and [[Galen Tyrol]] become aware of the fact they are Cylons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07085/770732-352.stm Ronald Moore confirms they are Cylons in this interview]&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[music]] (which turns out to be &quot;[[All Along The Watchtower]],&quot; as performed by [[Bear McCreary|Bear McCreary's]] brother &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearmccreary.com/html/blog/blogmain.htm|title=Bear's Battlestar Galactica Blog|accessdate=2007-12-11|author=Bear McCreary|work=|date=2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) only they can hear, and a &quot;switch&quot; that goes off within them (as Chief Tyrol mentions). Foster and Anders have experienced at least the beginnings of a physical relationship. As the Cylon fleet attacked, Tigh defiantly declared &quot;Whatever else I am, I'm an officer in the Colonial Fleet and if I die today, that's the man I'll be.&quot; Following this speech, Foster reported to the CIC to aid President Roslin.

Season 4 opens with Tory Foster continuing her participation in clandestine final-four Cylon meetings (Anders, Foster, Tigh, Tyrol). Tigh suggests Gaius Baltar as a potential source of information, citing Baltar's previous time spent among the Cylons;  Foster attempts to gain Gaius' confidence via professed admiration and seduction. Despite her initial objection to actual sexual relations, she has sex with Baltar during which she weeps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Six of One&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)| title= Six of One | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Baltar asks why she is crying, she says it's just something she does, and things could be worse: she could be a Cylon. Baltar tells her he believes Cylons can feel, and, touched, she stops crying and kisses him in earnest. Subsequently, she seems to be spending more and more time with Baltar, not necessarily just to gain information. In &quot;[[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]],&quot; she attends one of Baltar's monotheism rallies, and appears to be approving.

When she discovers [[Cally Tyrol]] has overheard one of the clandestine meetings, she follows her to a [[Colonial Viper|Viper]] launch tube, dissuades Cally from killing herself and her son, and secures the infant, but Foster then ejects the mother out the tube herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= The Ties That Bind (Battlestar Galactica)| title= The Ties That Bind | series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foster shows no guilt. She appears to have embraced both being a Cylon and her own version of Baltar's teachings, allowing her to by-pass such feelings and adopt an almost hedonistic approach to life. She declares herself to be &quot;perfect&quot;, something that disturbs fellow Cylons Tigh and Tyrol, and is in marked contrast to Tigh's and Caprica Six's guilty consciences ([[Escape Velocity (Battlestar Galactica)|Escape Velocity]]).

Later, Foster meets with President Roslin, who first pleasantly comments about Foster's positive change in mood any time she is aboard Galactica. Roslin asks Foster to find out who was sharing the rumors of the president's shared visions to Baltar, then sticks the dagger in, telling Foster she is very aware that she is sleeping with Gaius Baltar. Before Foster can say a word, Roslin tells her there are enough reports of her visitations to &quot;make her a charter member of his nymph squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cult of Baltar&quot;/&gt;&quot; Foster confesses to believing in Baltar's spiritual message, but Roslin is feeling quite betrayed and turns her back on her to do other work, ordering her away ([[Guess What's Coming to Dinner?]]).

Out of the known members of the Final Five, Tory seems to be embracing her Cylon-self more than the others. The other three are attempting to maintain their human selves (the same way that [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Boomer]] did). This results in a change to her personality.

After Downloaded Three is unboxed, now knowing the identities of the Final Five, and brought to Galactica, Foster stays true her earlier affinity for her Cylon side. Under the pretence of bringing Laura Roslin her medication, she flies to the Cylon basestar, where she is introduced to her fellow Cylons and tells Roslin and Baltar about her true nature. During the ensuing stand off between Three and Galactica over the remaining three Cylons, she helps Three's cause by informing her of Lee Adama's perceived weaknesses (Revelations).

When the fleet arrives at Earth and discovers it is a barren world destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe and once populated by Cylons, Foster and her fellow Final Five Cylons begin remembering details about their past lives on the planet. One detail she clearly remembers is how Anders used to be a musician and used to play a song he wrote for her and their friends, Galen Tyrol and Saul and Ellen Tigh. She and Tyrol were also lovers at the time ([[No Exit (Battlestar Galactica)|No Exit]]).

Since being publicly identified as a member of the Final Five Cylons, Foster has taken up full-time residence on board the rebel basestar, living with the Twos, Sixes (less Caprica-Six), and Eights (less Sharon Agathon &amp; Sharon Valerii). Her fellow Cylons appear to have also given her equal status in their command hierarchy, as evident by her behaviour during Gaeta's Mutiny. When Laura Roslin is smuggled aboard the basestar, Foster is content to abandon the fleet to its own turmoil and simply jump away to safety, a notion her fellow Cylons support. Though she repeatedly argues against involving the basestar in the counter-coup efforts, she ultimately concedes to Roslin's plan ([[Blood on the Scales]]).

During Gaeta's mutiny Sam Anders is shot in the back of the skull. When he regains consciousness he remembers his and the others former life on Earth and after. He recites the history as fast as he could to the other Final Five, including Tory Foster. Like the other Fives, she was a scientist attempting to reinvent resurrection technology. To her and Galen Tyrol's mutual shock she learned they were once lived together as lovers and were engaged to be married. (No Exit)

After Anders's apparently unsuccessful (in that he never regained consciousness) surgery and his comatose state, Foster urges the other Finals and Caprica Six to leave for the Baseship and abandon the fleet in order to strike out on their own without humanity. Then Ellen Tigh, the Fifth Final, arrives after apparently being rescued from Cavil by Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii. The Final Five debate the merits of staying with the fleet versus leaving. When the matter is put to a vote, Tyrol and Foster vote to leave and Tigh votes to stay. Though Anders is in a coma during this debate, Tyrol reminds the others Anders had previously pleaded with Colonel Tigh to stay with the fleet, and they agree to count Anders's vote thusly. This means the vote is a 2-2 deadlock with Ellen Tigh holding the deciding vote. Ellen is conflicted and postpones her decision, as she is upset by her discovery of the relationship between Saul Tigh and Caprica Six. Later, driven by jealousy, resentment and anger over Saul Tigh conceiving a child with Caprica Six and the implication he loved Caprica Six more than he ever did Ellen, Ellen makes her decision and votes with Foster and Tyrol to leave humanity. However Caprica Six's miscarriage, possibly brought on by stress caused by an attack in Dogsville and personal confrontations with Ellen Tigh over the true love of Saul Tigh, changes the situation. Foster and the others reluctantly decide to stay, since the loss of Caprica Six's pregnancy means Hera Agathon has become the only remaining hope of Cylon continuity ([[Deadlock]]).

As the Five recover from the tragedy of the miscarriage, Tory commiserates with the others, including a Tyrol desperate to save the life of Boomer, who was about to be transported for trial on the Baseship. She agrees with Ellen Tigh they cannot interfere with Cylon due process other than being witnesses. At Joe's Bar, Tory hears Kara Thrace playing the piano and recognizes the tune as the song switching on the Final Four in the nebula. She confronts Thrace to find out where she learned that song. Thrace informs her it was a song her father played for her as a child. Later off-screen she told them she was playing the music notes written as a drawing by Hera Agathon. By this time, Sharon Valerii had already abducted Hera and escaped back to Cavil's Baseship ([[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]).

Tory continues to congregate with the Final Five, who are by now a close-knit group watching over their comatose member (Anders). However, the group temporarily loses Tyrol as he is imprisoned for his role in unwittingly allowing Valerii to kidnap Hera and escape. Ellen Tigh urges the Adamas to search for Hera on the Cylon Homeworld, and is emphatically supported by Anders's wife [[Kara Thrace]]. Tory abstains from voicing her own opinion on the matter, but she agrees with Ellen's recommendation and helps arrange the Heavy Raider reconnaissance mission after Adama gives his permission ([[Islanded in a Stream of Stars]]).

Tory reluctantly volunteers for the mission to rescue Hera, partially due to the insistence of [[Galen Tyrol]]. She assists Ellen in maintaining the link between Anders and ''Galactica'' during the battle. After agreeing to share resurrection technology with the Cylons in exchange for a truce, Tory becomes nervous the sharing process will involve a pooling of her memories with the rest of the Five, which will reveal the truth about the murder of Cally. Tory therefore asks the others to pledge that no matter what they find out about each other, they will forgive each other for it. Tigh agrees and the Five start the process, but when Tyrol sees her memory of murdering Cally he flies into a rage, breaks the download to strangle Tory, and ultimately snaps her neck in retribution.

'''Warren Fox''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Jamie Lomas]]. The character made his first appearance on 26 June 2006. The character and casting was announced on 12 May 2006. Warren was introduced as an old acquaintance of [[Sean Kennedy (Hollyoaks)|Sean Kennedy]] ([[Matthew Jay Lewis]]). The character is decipted as selfish, arrogant and devious who would do anything to get what he wants. Lomas chose to leave the series in 2009 and his departure coincided with the return of [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]). Warren's reintroduction was announced on 17 October 2010 and he returned on 29 October 2010. The character made his second departure from the series in December 2011 and was reintroduced for a second time in May 2016.

His main storylines have revolved around his villainy, and thuggish lifestyle. His first stint on the show saw the character involved in drug dealing, infidelity and a feud with Clare. The character's villainous attitudes have led him to murder two other characters, [[Sean Kennedy]] and Warren's fiancée [[Louise Summers]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). A show stunt, which saw The Loft set ablaze, apparently killed Warren. The character's 2010 return saw him revealed to have survived the fire and absconded witch saw Warren kill [[Dale Greer]]. Writers plotted a partnership and feud with [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]), which proved popular with viewers. Other storylines involved Warren murdering [[Kyle Ryder]] (Neil Toon) and close relationships with [[Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) and [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]). Warren's long-lost son [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still; Rory Douglas-Speed) was introduced in November 2011. Warren was arrested for his crimes in December 2011, serving as his departure. The character was released from prison to aid his 2016 reintroduction. He avenged his imprisonment by targeting Mitzeee's sister [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) and beginning a fake relationship with her under an alias. Maxine became pregnant, but miscarried their child. He also entered a relationship with [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) who targeted Warren and Joel individually after believing Warren caused her daughter's death and also killing [[Bart McQueen]] who Warren thought was responsible for his sister Katy's death back in 2014.

==Storylines==
Warren arrives in Hollyoaks in April 2006 to find Sean. Warren demands money from Sean as compensation for having him jailed, but is willing to write off Sean's debts he owes him in exchange for a night with his wife, [[Louise Summers|Louise Kennedy]] ([[Roxanne McKee]]). Louise refuses to sleep with him, and tells Sean that the only way to settle the debt would be to give Warren ownership of Evissa. Sean agrees. Warren embarks on an affair with [[Clare Devine|Clare Cunningham]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), whilst she is still married to [[Max Cunningham]] ([[Matt Littler]]). A passionate rendezvous between them is taped by [[Mel Burton]] ([[Cassie Powney]]), which she shows to [[Sam &quot;OB&quot; O'Brien]] ([[Darren Jeffries]]) and [[Sophie Burton]] ([[Connie Powney]]). Mel and Sophie are killed afterwards, and OB is severely injured, in the explosion at [[The Dog in the Pond]]. OB tells Max about the affair and Max fires Warren from The Loft. Warren hires thugs to trash The Loft. Max reluctantly signs his half of The Loft over to Warren. When Clare returns, she and Warren are partners in owning The Loft. However, Warren and Clare dispute. Warren and [[Calvin Valentine]] ([[Ricky Whittle]]) begin to have a rivalry for Louise's affections.

[[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) sleeps with Warren after being accused of infidelity by her boyfriend, [[Russ Owen]] ([[Stuart Manning]]). When Warren uncovers Sean's return, demanding £10,000 from Louise, he agrees to help Louise gain the money. However, Warren later kidnaps Sean and kills him. Louise and Calvin end their relationship, and Warren supports her. After sleeping together, Louise guiltily reunites with Calvin. [[Justin Burton]] ([[Chris Fountain]]) later resides with Warren. Warren is arrested for Sean's murder after Clare alerts the police. He is however released after a failure to find Sean's body. Shortly after, Clare is pushed over the balcony of The Loft in an attempt on her life. Justin witness Warren and Mercedes in bed as he plans to leave with [[Katy Fox|Katy]] ([[Hannah Tointon]]). Justin heads to the train station and is run over by a van. Warren is arrested for the attempt on Clare's life, but is innocent. During his court appearance, Warren is found innocent as Mercedes admits she was with him. Warren visited a hospitalised Justin, revealing he was the assailant who almost killed him and later, Katy is disgusted to learn that Warren killed Sean.

Warren grows fonder of Justin, who begins working for Warren, as Louise and Warren's relationship becomes more serious. Clare continues attempts to drive Louise and Warren apart. However, Warren threatens to push her from the balcony if she does not sign over The Loft to him and leave Hollyoaks, to which she agrees. Days later, Warren returns home to his flat to find it trashed and no sign of Katy. Warren, Justin and Max begin looking for her, and are later called by Clare, who tells them she has Katy. Clare tells Warren that she wants revenge on Justin for pushing her over the balcony. Warren pretends to kill Justin. However, Clare is not fooled, so drives off with Katy tied up in the car. Warren, Max and Justin follow her. As Clare swerves to avoid cyclists, she crashes over a cliff and into water below. Warren, Justin and Max jump in, rescuing Katy. Clare meanwhile, disappears underneath the water, apparently dying. Some time after, Louise is notified that a body has been found, and it may be Sean. Louise identifies the body, but it turns out to not be Sean's. Katy attempts to try to tell Louise that Warren killed Sean, but he ends up proposing to her, to which she accepts. During their engagement party, Louise becomes suspicious of Warren's dealings, and is later attacked in Evissa by [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]), who ends up setting fire to it and leaving Louise for dead. Calvin saves Louise, and the next day, Warren beats up Ste.

Following a poker game with [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), [[Mike Barnes (Hollyoaks)|Mike Barnes]] ([[Tony Hirst]]) and [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]), Warren ends up winning Darren's half of The Dog. Warren tells Louise he has bought her The Dog for Christmas. When they inform [[Jack Osborne|Jack]] ([[James McKenna]]) and [[Frankie Osborne]] ([[Helen Pearson]]) that they now own a half of The Dog, Jack suffers a heart attack. As Jack recovers, Frankie goes through the unpleasantness of having to share The Dog with Warren and Louise. Warren's old friends appear at The Dog and hold everyone hostage, which ends with Darren getting shot. Louise feels she cannot trust Warren anymore, but forgives him when he signs back his half of The Dog to the Osbornes. [[Barry &quot;Newt&quot; Newton]] ([[Nico Mirallegro]]) and [[Lauren Valentine]] ([[Dominique Jackson]]) find Sean's body, and Warren confesses to Louise that he killed him. Louise is furious, but becomes more angry when she finds out Katy knew. Louise then exposes Katy and [[Zak Ramsey]]'s ([[Kent Riley]]) affair to Warren. Katy is angry when Louise agrees to become an alibi for Warren on the night of Sean's death as she does not want him to go to prison. Katy tells Warren to admit to the murder but he refuses. Katy decides to leave, but is dragged from a taxi by Louise and Warren. After Warren attempts to convince Katy to stay, she leaves. Louise is later arrested for Sean's murder. Warren and Darren persuade mentally unstable [[Jake Dean]] ([[Kevin Sacre]]) to confess to Sean's murder, to which he does. Louise is then released.

[[Mandy Richardson]] ([[Sarah Jayne Dunn]]) and Louise become wedding planners. Mandy then starts to help Warren plan his wedding to Louise. Louise becomes very suspicious of Warren and Mandy, believing they are sleeping together. [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) pushes Louise further into believing this. Louise turns to alcohol, which finally drives Warren to confide in Mandy and begin an affair. [[Ravi Roy]] ([[Stephen Uppal]]) ends up finding Mandy and Warren sleeping together on one occasion, but agrees to keep quiet. [[Nige Foster]] (Sam Townend) is revealed to be alive, despite Warren telling Calvin, who thinks he killed him, he is dead. Warren pays Nige money to stay hidden so that it keeps Calvin on his side. Calvin agrees to take part in a raid on The Loft after he is approached by [[Mark Gascoyne|DI Mark Gascoyne]] (Craig Russell). Not having time to warn Warren about the raid, Calvin goes along with Mark and two other officers, whom he later discovers are not police officers and that the raid is unofficial. Mark gets Calvin to beat Warren up as revenge on him after he beat him up. Calvin has to agree, however he phones an ambulance afterwards.

Mandy tells Louise about the affair and the pair plan revenge on Warren, after Louise tells Mandy that Warren killed Sean. They then come up with a plan to steal Warren's money and go to the police about the murder. Louise sees CCTV footage of Warren and Mandy sleeping together in The Loft and decides to murder Warren and frame Mandy. On the wedding day, Warren's foster brother [[Spencer Gray]] ([[Darren John Langford]]) turns up, stating his mother has died. Warren asks him to be his best man. Warren, Ravi and Spencer arrive at the hotel where the wedding is being held. Warren goes up to Louise's room where he hides a necklace for her, however, he finds the gun which she plans to use to kill him. Warren takes the gun and removes the bullets as Louise returns to the room. He gives her the necklace and asks if the gun was his present. Louise reveals she hates Warren because he had ruined her life, killed her husband and cheated on her. Warren begins crying and apologises to Louise, telling her that he wants to start a family with her. Louise picks up the gun and tells him she could never bring his child into the world. However, Louise discovers the gun is empty and Warren reveals he has the bullets. Warren attacks Louise for trying to kill him. A struggle breaks out and Warren ends up killing Louise. The wedding party believe Louise left Warren due to his affair, unaware of her death. A heartbroken Warren watches as Mandy leaves the village with Tony. Carmel and Calvin approach him in an attempt to comfort him. Carmel mentions that Louise was pregnant, leaving Warren devastated.

Warren captures the affections of [[Sasha Valentine]] ([[Nathalie Emmanuel]]), who Warren asks to help look after Spencer. Warren and Sasha share a kiss. Warren upsets her by having a one-night stand with [[Sarah Barnes]] ([[Loui Batley]]). However, Warren and Sasha eventually begin a relationship, with Sasha moving in. Calvin makes numerous attempts to stop his sister from seeing Warren, however it only pushes her away. Calvin then records a confession from Warren that he murdered Sean, and also admits to Louise's murder. Mark arrests Warren, but later tells Calvin that the recorder has not worked and that Warren will be released. Calvin goes to see Warren at The Loft and a fight breaks out. The fight gets out of hand when Warren is knocked over The Loft balcony. Sasha breaks them up as onlookers watch. After Calvin announces Warren as a murderer in front of the villagers, Sasha takes Warren's side.

Warren starts to become the victim of a hate campaign with posters spread around the village declaring him to be a murderer. He receives mysterious phone calls and poison pen letters. In an attempt to leave the village with some money, Warren makes a deal with Justin to burn down The Loft for £5,000 so that he can claim the insurance money and Justin can get money to start a new life with [[Hannah Ashworth]] ([[Emma Rigby]]). Justin agrees and goes to meet Warren at The Loft, but is stopped by Calvin who tells him not to get involved with another of Warren's schemes. Changing his mind Justin leaves only to be seen by Sasha. While waiting for Justin in the club, Warren is knocked out by Clare using a baseball bat. When Warren awakens, he finds himself tied to a chair and is shocked to see that Clare is alive. She tells him that both he and Justin have ruined her life and makes Warren call Justin to meet at The Loft. Calvin then arrives to speak to Warren and finds Warren tied up, Clare with a match and The Loft covered in petrol. He initially proceeds to do the right thing by calling the police, but after Warren taunts Clare by saying that he always wins, Calvin backs off and leaves his fate in Clare's hands. Hannah arrives at The Loft to find Justin, and Clare accidentally knocks her out. She wakes up and attacks Clare, who drops a match onto the bar, the pair fall through the banister to the floor below unconscious. Justin enters The Loft through the upstairs door, where he finds Warren tied up. Justin asks him where Hannah is and Warren tells him that she is not there. Justin starts to untie him but he hears Hannah's calls for help and realises that Warren lied. He leaves him in the fire and escapes with Hannah. Clare is nowhere to be seen and has escaped. Warren unties himself and realises he cannot get out of the balcony door so jumps down the cellar door, he lands on his ankle on the stairs and breaks it. Warren looks up at the ceiling mirror and notices the support chains are on fire. They break and the mirror collapses onto Warren, apparently killing him instantly.

Over a year after his supposed death, Warren returns to Hollyoaks in October 2010, revealing he is alive. He breaks into Chez Chez and leaves a dead fox for club owner [[Cheryl Brady]] ([[Bronagh Waugh]]). The next day, Warren follows Mandy in the village and is seen by [[Tom Cunningham]] ([[Ellis Hollins]]), who claims to have seen Warren's ghost. Warren is later seen by Tony walking past the village walls. Mandy and Warren meet, revealing they are in a relationship and have had contact since their last encounter. Warren tells Mandy that they are going to destroy Tony, as revenge for him leaving her abroad. On the same night, a fire is started in Il Gnosh by an unseen character and [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]) and [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) are killed.

The following day, Warren and Mandy argue and she threatens him. Later, Warren enters the McQueens' home where he asks [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) who she has told and mentions that someone else knows, but does not reveal what he is referring to. It is later revealed that Theresa witnessed Warren escaping The Loft and since then, he has been blackmailed. On another occasion, Warren threatens to push Theresa from a roof in the village if she does not tell him who has been blackmailing him. He also reveals how he escaped the fire. In flashback scenes, days before the fire Warren meets a suicidal man named [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2010)#Other characters|Dale Greer]] ([[Chris Geere]]). Dale and Warren bond and he begins working for him. When Clare starts the fire and Warren is apparently killed by the mirror, the floors collapsed and Warren is found by Dale in the cellar. After being rescued by Dale, Warren realises everyone believes he is still in the club. Warren kills Dale before putting his body in the cellar. Warren then threatens to kill Theresa, who witnesses him escaping, if she tells anyone. Warren then leaves the village. With Warren still threatening to push her from the walls, Theresa admits she killed Calvin and this forms the beginning of their relationship, as friends, in which they both help protect the other's secret.

Warren breaks into Chez Chez and tries to break the floor with a sledgehammer, however is interrupted by [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Brendan asks who Warren is. Warren lies that he is Cheryl's boyfriend before phoning Mandy for information about him. Warren enters The Dog to the surprise of local residents. Claiming to have suffered from amnesia, Warren pretends to regain some of his memory of several people. Warren later confronts Tony and the pair have a stand off with Tony threatening to attack Warren for telling Dom to burn down his restaurant which resulted in the death of Steph and Malachy. Warren then leaves and Brendan Brady tells Tony to call the police and inform them that Warren is still alive. Warren is later arrested and taken into custody where he is interviewed by [[DC Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]). Warren tells Ethan to speak to his commanding officers and later Warren is released. After returning to the village Warren meets with Cheryl in time for Christmas and she believes he truly has feelings for her. A few days later Warren returns to the club where he starts to dig up the floor. Danny Houston watches Warren doing so on the club's CCTV and calls Brendan. Danny tells Brendan to find out what Warren is up to, believing him to be in league with the police. Brendan then locks Warren in the cellar and asks him to tell him everything but Warren doesn't. Brendan then leaves Warren locked in the cellar until he admits to what he is up to.Warren and Brendan plan to get Danny's half of the club from him however things don't go to plan and Brendan kills Danny. Warren helps Brendan get rid of Danny's body in the pond by the Dog.

Warren finds out that Mandy had been sending him the texts in order for him to come back to Hollyoaks with her. Warren frightens her out the village. When [[Kyle Ryder]] (Neil Toon) is due in court Theresa faces prison. In order to stop her being sent down Warren arranges for Kyle to be beaten up meaning the court case has to be postponed. Brendan helps Warren by getting Kyle to escape from hospital leaving him to go on the run. Brendan jumps to the wrong conclusions believing that Warren really killed Calvin and that Theresa is taking the blame for him. Brendan pretends to be Warren and encourages Kyle to seek revenge on Theresa, hoping that the truth will come out.

Although Warren is supposed to be with Cheryl, he soon returns his cheating ways when [[Mitzeee]] ([[Rachel Shenton]]) grabs his attention. Warren doesn't understand why she is interested in Brendan, unknowing their relationship is fake. Warren and Mitzeee almost sleep together but are stopped before they have chance when Cheryl walks in. Cheryl is none the wiser but Brendan cottons on and warns Mitzeee not to make a fool of him.

Warren reassures Theresa when she hears that Kyle is still about, thinking that Brendan has ensured that Kyle has taken the money and run. Warren becomes suspicious when Kyle comes to Chez Chez asking for Warren and Warren later sees him talking to Brendan. Warren does everything he can to persuade Theresa not to leave with her baby in fear of Kyle but she leaves anyway. When Warren phones Theresa and Kyle answers telling him that he is doing what they had arranged Warren realises that Brendan has been pretending to be him. At first Brendan refuses to tell Warren where Kyle has taken Theresa but when he realises that Theresa and her baby Kathleen-Angel might die he tells him. Warren turns up and Kyle knocks him out. Later, Warren has regained consciousness and shoots Kyle in the back not knowing that he is holding Kathleen-Angel, and Kyle falls down the lift shaft with the baby. Theresa is horrified and believes that Warren had been plotting with Kyle all along after what Kyle had said on the phone. Ethan, who had been pushed down the lift shaft by Kyle previously, helps Warren to get Kathleen-Angel out but cannot get out himself. Warren urges Theresa to leave with Carmel and the baby but she doesn't listen and goes back to save Ethan. She falls into the lift shaft while trying and then forces Warren to save Ethan before she lets him save herself. He saves Ethan and then suddenly the lift plummets with Kyle's dead body and Theresa still on top of it.

In hospital as Theresa fights for her life, Carmel accuses Warren of being in love with Theresa and his face leads the audience to think this is true. Warren then makes sure Ethan stays quiet and Theresa says thanks for his help. He then sleeps with Mitzeee and Warren and Brendan have a huge fight. They eventually call a truce until Ste attacks Brendan with a baseball bat, which hospitalises him. Warren then stole drugs from Brendan later in the month and begin a relationship with Mitzeee. When Mitzeee's mum, [[Trish Minniver|Trish]] (Paula Wolfenden), is imprisoned, Ethan agrees to let her go if she gets a confession from Warren admitting to the murder of Louise. She tries to tape record him however Warren finds out. Warren ends up confessing to Mitzeee about Louise's murder. On ''Hollyoaks Later'', Warren is told by Mitzeee to get the truth from him about Mercedes. Warren then organised a prostitute called Honey for [[Seth Costello]] ([[Miles Higson]]) and Seth sleeps with Honey. Warren then finds Seth over Honey's corpse and places her dead body in the forest. The next day, he burys it under the ground. He then steals a gun and burns the rival stag clothes. Warren then reveals to Mitzeee that he tricked Seth into believing he had killed Honey. Seth's older brother, [[Riley Costello|Riley]] (Rob Norbury), then finds out about this and locks Warren down a mine and Warren then gets animal beaten and gets out of the mine. He then almost kills Riley by flooding the stags and his girlfriend Mitzeee. Warren then reveals to Mitzeee he knows the secret and the secret is Mercedes had an affair with Riley's father, [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]). When he returns, he visits Brendan in prison and tells him to get used to it.

One night, Mitzeee spends the night at Riley's. Nothing happens but Riley's brother [[Jason Costello]] ([[Victoria Atkin]]) takes a picture of them together and sends it to Warren. After a fight with Riley, Warren is fuming. Carl and Mitzeee stop him from beating Riley to a pulp, however the Costellos then push Mitzeee too far so she and Warren agree to destroy the Costellos on the day of the wedding. Warren gets Mitzeee an invite to the wedding and makes plans to reveal all at the wedding. He fires Gilly and rehires Rhys within a day. Warren warns Doug that if Doug reveals the truth, Warren will break his legs, and demands £50,000 from Mercedes and Carl within 24 hours, or he will reveal the truth. Carl gives him 25,000 of it with the other half on condition of the truth not coming out at the wedding. Doug tells Warren he's going to tell the truth but in retaliation Warren throws Doug to the ground and forces him to put copies of Mitzee's book underneath each chair. Warren sees Doug telling Seth to tell the truth and so Warren attacks Doug and threatens that he will kill him if he reveals the truth. In the end Mercedes tells Riley about the affair at the wedding. After the wedding Warren attacks Doug.

When Ethan accidentally runs [[Rob Edwards (Hollyoaks)|Rob Edwards]] (David Atkins) over, Warren helps Ethan repair his vehicle and uses the situation to his advantage for Ethan's help in his dirty games. Mitzeee leaves Warren citing Louise's murder as her reason. Warren gets angry, and chucks Mitzeee's clothes into the river then threatens both Ste and Cheryl but when he threatens new DJ, [[Joel Dexter]] (Andrew Still). Joel claims Warren is his father. Warren goes into denial, believing the claim to be either one of Brendan's games or a lie told to Joel by his mother, however Theresa convinces Warren to have a DNA test which shows he is indeed Joel's father. After this happens Brendan returns and he and Warren declare a truce but Warren tells Ethan he is going to kill Brendan and he wants an alibi from him.

Mitzeee and Brendan hatch a plan to get Warren out of the way by uncovering Louise's murder and getting him sent down. Warren tells Mitzeee he wants to marry her but before he agrees to show her Louise's grave, just like she had wanted. Unbeknownst to Mitzeee, Warren has seen past her plan and he forces her to dig Louise's grave. Warren also orders Joel to shoot Brendan and Joel pulls a gun out on Brendan whilst they are in the car, on the way to find Warren and Mitzeee. Warren then begins to strangle Mitzeee when she refuses to keep digging. However, Brendan arrives just in time to save her. Brendan holds Warren at gunpoint and tells him that he shot Joel. Outraged, Warren tackles Brendan to the ground and a fight ensues, in which Warren disarms Brendan. Warren the picks up a brick in an attempt to finish him off. However, Joel arrives and hits Warren with the shovel, revealing Brendan and Joel came to an agreement. The police, who Brendan called, arrive and arrest Warren for Louise's murder.

[[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] (Gregory Finnegan) gets Warren released early on legal technicalities. He poses as &quot;Mike Jones&quot; to trick Mitzeee's sister, [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]), and starts a relationship with her. He tries to steal a key from her flat which would access hidden money in order to pay legal fees. But [[Sienna Blake]] (Anna Passey) steals the key and blackmails him into helping secure a murder confession from Maxine in exchange for the key. Warren reveals that his real reason for being back in the village is to get vengeance for the death of his sister, Katy. Warren prepares to leave again, but Sienna gives him the key. He stays and they sleep together. Later on, Warren is able to get Maxine to confess that she buried Patrick's body. Warren decides to keep this away from Sienna after discovering how vulnerable Maxine is, but Sienna pushes him and he reveals the truth. They call the police who investigate the city wall, where Patrick was buried. When Maxine returns from the police station, Warren and Sienna announce that they were together to make Maxine confess, making Maxine leave the house. Warren continues his feud with other residents, especially [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]), who he uses a prison mate to scare him. Warren helps rescue Sienna's daughter [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) and her friend [[Peri Lomax]] (Ruby O'Donnell) after they are trapped in the woods, whilst camping. The same day, Warren and Sienna begin an relationship. Warren sets out on a trip down memory lane, he visits several places in the village relevant to his past. Upon walking around the villages, Warren discovers there is a hate campaign against him started by the Osbornes who have pribted detailing his murderous past. Warren also tries to bond with Peri's father [[Cameron Campbell]] (Cameron Moore) but he tells Warren he knows of his criminal past, which leaves Warren angry. Later, he breaks into the Osbournes house and sends Jack an anonymous photograph of a Police award on Jack's mantlepiece. Jack arrives home to find Warren standing in his living room. Warren threatens Jack and tells him to ensure the hate campaign stops, otherwise Warren will expose Jack's dark secrets regarding Warren's former cell mate Billy to the rest village. He makes friends with [[Freddie Roscoe]] (Charlie Chapman) after hearing on the phone that he needs a engine for his van. Warren tells Freddie he will get him an engine as long as he can have 10% of the cut, so he later steals [[Dirk Savage]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]])'s engine unknown to Freddie. Despite Freddie threatening to pull the plug on the sale for lack of interest, Warren uses his business acumen and manages to sell the renovated camper van to [[Mac Nightingale]] for £18,000. Despite this, Freddie still only offers him 10% of the deal, this angers Warren and he tells Freddie he won't forget his actions. Being aware of the financial difficulty the garage is in, Warren then buys the Roscoes garage from the bank. Darren, beside himself over the identity of his new employer, turns to [[Grace Black]] (Tamara Wall) for help to get rid of Warren but this doesn't work. Grace then later finds out that Sienna is seeing Warren straight after Sienna told her she will never love anyone as much as she did with [[Trevor Royle]] ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) who she cheated on behind Grace's back so Grace recruits Darren, Maxine and Tony and three of them go to burn down the garage but Grace tips Warren off about the impending arson attack in a bid to win his trust. Grace invites Warren to the club for a business proposition, she then slides a gun over the table to Warren for protection. Stunned and angered, Warren pushes the gun back and tells her he can get his own. Warren leaves, unaware that she is planning to set him up. She later nicks his keys and phone and texts Sienna to go to the garage, she takes the gun with her and her brother [[Liam Donovan]] (Maxim Baldry) walks in and she shoots him. Grace and Liam's brother [[Adam Donovan]] (Jimmy Essex) thinks its Warren and so he punches Warren in the restaurant, who retaliates by ramming Adam against the wall. Warren realizes that he is being set up. Liam later gives the police his statement telling them it was Warren who shot him and Warren is arrested.

Warren is released as there is no evidence to prove that he shot Liam, angering Maxine, Darren and Nancy. Warren visits [[Grace Black]] in The Loft and tells her he knows she shot Liam and set him up, Warren grabs her by the arm aggressively and warns her to keep out of his way, having seen a glimpse of his true colours, Grace agrees to stay out of his way. Warren takes full control of the Roscoe garage, renaming it &quot;Warren Wheels&quot;. Warren tries to call a truce with Darren and Maxine but Maxine remains reluctant. Warren and Sienna try to call a truce with Darren who willingly accepts.

Warren enters the garage where [[Ryan Knight (Hollyoaks)|DI Ryan Knight]] lies in wait.

==Creation and development==
In May 2006, it was announced former ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'' actor [[Jamie Lomas]] would arrive in Hollyoaks as &quot;bad boy&quot; Warren Fox.&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a32863/two-dream-team-actors-transfer-to-hollyoaks.html|title=Two Dream Team actors transfer to Hollyoaks|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=12 May 2006|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his casting, it was announced his former ''Dream Team'' co-star [[Ricky Whittle]] would take on the part of &quot;mysterious&quot; [[Calvin Valentine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;/&gt; Speaking of Lomas and Whittle's casting, a ''Hollyoaks'' spokesperson stated: &quot;We're delighted to welcome Ricky and Jamie to the ''Hollyoaks'' cast. Their characters are set to bring lots of drama to the show!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dreamteam&quot;/&gt;

Warren immediately showed a confrontational personality from his original appearance on ''Hollyoaks''. He always put himself first, and would do anything to get what he wants involving money, women and business opportunities. Warren is selfish, arrogant and devious.

Following the announcement of Warren's return in October 2010, Jamie Lomas was asked whether he thought the character would have changed since his last appearance. He replied, &quot;I don't think you can really change a character like Warren. I think it would be a little boring if he came back as some sort of softie but, like I say, there are new people around now for him to bounce off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/5ahex5nadibbmj25dc4ub/view.e4 |title=Jamie Lomas (Warren) talks Hollyoaks |author=Abi B |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]] |publisher=([[Channel 4]]) |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Warren spits in Bert Brady's face as he is led away by cops.

In 2009, Jamie Lomas decided to quit the soap after three years. Speaking of his decision, Lomas stated: &quot;I've had a fantastic three years at ''Hollyoaks'' but having fully explored the character, I felt the time was right for me to move on. I'm delighted to be going out as part of such a dramatic storyline and my final scenes are some of the most dramatic I've ever filmed. I'm sure viewers will be hooked!&quot; He continued to say: &quot;I've had a great time playing Warren and have thoroughly enjoyed being part of the ''Hollyoaks'' cast where I've made some brilliant friends and worked with some great people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a149177/two-hollyoaks-stars-to-leave.html|title=Two Hollyoaks stars to leave|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Lomas admitted he initially wanted to stay on the show for only two years: &quot;Well I wanted to go after two years. I sat down with Bryan Kirkwood who told me what he had in store and it was too good to refuse! The storyline was so fantastic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a157274/jamie-lomass-final-hollyoaks-interview.html |title=Jamie Lomas's Final Hollyoaks Interview |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed how he felt about his final appearance, admitting: &quot;To be honest with you, when I knew I was filming my final scene — obviously I've spent three years of my life there and I've got lots of good friends there - I got really emotional. I had to take myself off and have a word with myself and say 'Come on — you need to pull it together!' It was great because all the producers came down and clapped me and bought me a bottle of champagne. It was very emotional.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a157610/jamie-lomas-my-exit-was-emotional.html |title=Jamie Lomas: 'My exit was emotional'

Lomas's final appearance as Warren also saw the return of [[Gemma Bissix]]'s character, and Warren's enemy, [[Clare Devine]], and featured a fire in The Loft, which caused Warren's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a150705/gemma-bissix-returns-to-hollyoaks.html |title=Gemma Bissix returns to Hollyoaks |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=25 March 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, it was announced Lomas would be reintroduced to ''Hollyoaks'' in late 2010, when it is revealed that he in fact survived the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;shockreturn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a282528/shock-comeback-for-hollyoaks-character.html|title=Shock comeback for Hollyoaks character|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=17 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series producer [[Paul Marquess]] commented on Warren's return, saying: &quot;We were hopeful that Jamie's return would be the best-kept secret in soap history, but when Jamie arrived on set it proved impossible. When Warren Fox died in the Loft fire, we all thought that was the end of the dangerous gangster that terrorised the residents of Hollyoaks village. But when our writers made the shocking suggestion to bring back Warren in a juicy plot, it was just too irresistible to ignore as they not only made it feasible that Warren could have escaped the fire and fled the village, they created an explosive and very clever plot with lots of twists and turns that is guaranteed to have the audience hooked. When the idea was pitched to Jamie, he knew it was too good an opportunity to miss. Warren Fox was one of the soap's most memorable villains and we're very excited about his return.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shockreturn&quot;/&gt; He returned on 29 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/cghinnrbef4eopboipwa4g/view.e4 |title=Warren Fox to return to Hollyoaks! |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]] |publisher=([[Channel 4]]) |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomas later expressed his feelings about returning, saying: &quot;I'm really excited. I got the call and I got told about the storyline and it was great — full of twists and turns. I kind of thought that my character had run his course with the other characters that were around before, but there's a new breed in now, so that means plenty of potential for Warren to come back in and cause some more mayhem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;warren&quot;/&gt;

Speaking of the explanation for Warren surviving, Lomas said, &quot;The saving grace was that they never actually saw my body — all they saw was me getting hit by a mirror. So we're going to do a whole storyline on how Warren got out, what happened and whose body it was that they found badly burnt. It's really exciting and I think the fans are going to love it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lomas interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a284918/jamie-lomas-warren-fox-hollyoaks.html |title=Jamie Lomas (Warren Fox, Hollyoaks) |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-screen, flashback sequences were filmed to show how Warren survived the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;lomas interview&quot;/&gt; ''Hollyoaks'' announced a special episode centred around Warren and how he survived the fire to be broadcast on 1 December 2010, shown to viewers in various flashbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a287547/hollyoaks-confirms-special-warren-ep.html |title=Hollyoaks confirms special Warren ep |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, it was announced that Lomas had decided to leave the serial once again. Lomas filmed his final scenes in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' star Jamie Lomas to leave soap|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a335234/hollyoaks-star-jamie-lomas-to-leave-soap.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=16 August 2011|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His departure was broadcast on 23 December 2011.

Ruth Deller of entertainment website ''[[Lowculture]]'' has often criticised Warren; in one feature she slammed his final storylines stating: &quot;Apparently he's still around and there's some tedious and unlikely 'romance' between him and Sasha. Oh, and he's bedded Swimbint (Sarah Barnes) for good measure. Really, didn't this character's point expire about two years ago now?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/02/28/soapstar-superstars-february/|title=Soapstar Superstars: February|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|author=Deller, Ruth|date=28 February 2009|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gareth McLean of ''[[Radio Times]]'' has been critical of Warren stating: &quot;There are many bad apples in Hollyoaks, but only one that's rotten to the core. Warren Fox has caused so much misery to so many people - Russ, Mercedes, Ste, Cindy, the Barneses, the Deans and don't forget Justin - it's a wonder the villagers haven't ganged up, Murder on the Orient Express-style, and offed him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;holll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Gareth|title=The week in soapland|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/624-soaps-men-behaving-badly/|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=([[BBC Magazines]])|accessdate=2011-01-01|date=1 May 2009&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vP0BZQUi|archivedate=1 January 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frankenstein''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[Death Race (franchise)|Death Race franchise]]. Within the film universe, the character is an alias taken on by other characters who participate in the titular race.

==Character biography==
===''Death Race 2000''===
In the original [[Death Race 2000|1975 film]], Frankenstein is portrayed as the reigning champion of the Death Race, an annual gladiator-style cross-country race. A symbol of the ruling fascist government, he is a feared racer who is purported to be half-man, half-machine.

In reality, it turns out that there have been several Frankensteins over the years – each one recruited by the government to replace their injured or killed predecessors. In this way, with each man donning the same alias and disguise, Frankenstein seems to be an unkillable opponent who survives any crash or injury. The current Frankenstein ([[David Carradine]]), is disillusioned with the government, as well as the race, and he plans to assassinate the tyrannical President (Sandy McCallum). Although his plans to win the race and destroy the government are nearly ruined by the actions of a Resistance movement, he eventually succeeds in both winning and killing the President. He then assumes the office of President himself and puts an end to the Death Race.

===''Death Race''===
In the [[Death Race (film)|2008 remake]] of the 1975 film, ex-race driver Jensen Ames ([[Jason Statham]]) is imprisoned on Terminal Island after he is framed for his wife's murder. Terminal Island is home to a televised gladiator-style race called &quot;Death Race&quot;, and Ames soon finds himself forced to race by the tyrannical Warden Hennessey ([[Joan Allen]]). Ames must assume the mantle of Frankenstein, the current leading racer, whose appearance is covered by a mask. The previous Frankenstein was killed in a fiery crash, though the prison population believes he has simply spent the last six months recovering in the infirmary. The previous Frankenstein had already won four out of five races necessary to secure freedom, requiring Ames to only win one more race. Hennessey explains that Frankenstein is the most popular racer in the history of the race, and ratings would take a sharp hit if his death were announced.

Ames soon learns that Hennessey was behind his wife's murder, using Ulrich ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]), the lead guard, and Pachenko ([[Max Ryan]]), a fellow racer. Ames decides to win the Death Race and use it as means of revenge. With only his crew pit knowing the truth about Frankenstein, Ames goes on to uncover what happened to his predecessor and succeeds in using the race to escape, along with his chief rival, Machine-Gun Joe ([[Tyrese Gibson]]). Afterwards, Coach ([[Ian McShane]]), a member of his pit crew, detonates a bomb in Hennessey's office, killing both her and Ulrich. It is unknown if the Frankenstein mantle was resurrected by the next warden.

===''Death Race 2''===
This [[Death Race 2|prequel]] to the 2008 film reveals the origins of Frankenstein. [[Getaway driver]] Carl &quot;Luke&quot; Lucas ([[Luke Goss]]) is captured after a bank robbery gone bad, in which he was to protect the nephew of crime boss Markus Kane ([[Sean Bean]]). Although loyal and refusing to cooperate with authorities, Lucas is marked for death by Kane because he knows too much. He is sent to Terminal Island and recruited to compete in ''Death Match'', a brutal gladiator-style show, ostensibly run by the aging warden but, in reality, controlled by producer September Jones ([[Lauren Cohan]]).  His fight results in a large-scale prison riot and ultimately spells the end of the controversial show.

''Death Match'' is replaced by ''Death Race'', a gladiatorial race that uses custom cars and unused spaced along the island's outer edges. The prize for winning five races is freedom.  Lucas initially does well but is targeted by the other drivers due to the bounty on his head. When he saves the life of fellow driver 14K ([[Robin Shou]]), 14K pays back this favor by killing Kane. Ultimately, Lucas is driven off the track and ends up in a seemingly fatal crash. However, he returns under a new identity created by Jones, Frankenstein, a horribly scarred racer who wears a mask. However, at the start of his next race, he rams and kills Jones, to the pleasure of her many enemies.

===''Death Race 3: Inferno''===
In the second [[Death Race 3: Inferno|prequel]], a direct bridge to the 2008 film, Lucas' ([[Luke Goss]]) appearance is restored with reconstructive surgery, but he still does not reveal his identity to his pit crew.  However, they discover that Lucas is Frankenstein after his mask is knocked off during a brawl at Kalahari Prison in South Africa, where Lucas and his crew are sent to compete in the first International Death Race. The new race is the brainchild of British billionaire Niles York ([[Dougray Scott]]). Because Lucas has won four of the five races required for his freedom, York demands he throw the final race or face death.

At the end of the race, Lucas crashes his car into the operations center, where York has been handcuffed to a table by his producer, incensed by York firing and replacing her. York is horribly burned in the fiery crash, and the world at large is then led to believe that York is the survived Frankenstein, despite his protestations. Lucas and his crew stage their deaths and escape, while the disfigured York, resigned to the fact that everyone believes he is Frankenstein, adopts the mantle. The film ends with York, now using an American accent (strongly implying that it is he who is the Frankenstein killed at the start of the 2008 film), stating in voiceover, &quot;I am Frankenstein. And I will have my revenge.&quot;

&lt;!--[[File:Frankenstein's 'Monster'.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A portrayal of Frankenstein's Monster, using [[prosthetic makeup]]]]--&gt;
'''Victor Frankenstein''' is the [[title character]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''. He is a [[scientist]] who, after studying chemical processes and the decay of living beings, gains an insight into the creation of life and gives life to his own creature, often referred to as [[Frankenstein's monster]], or often colloquially referred to as simply &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

==History==
The character of Frankenstein was born in [[Naples]] (according to the 1831 edition of the novel) and raised in [[Geneva]]. He was the son of Alphonse Frankenstein and Caroline Beaufort, who died of [[scarlet fever]] when Frankenstein was 17. He describes his ancestry thus: &quot;I am by birth a [[Geneva|Genevese]]; and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Mary. ''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus'' Chapter 1 (first sentence)&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenstein has two younger brothers—William, the youngest, and Ernest, the middle child. Frankenstein falls in love with [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], who became his adoptive sister (his blood cousin in the 1818 edition) and, eventually, his fiancée.

As a boy, Frankenstein is interested in the works of [[alchemy|alchemists]] such as [[Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Paracelsus]], and [[Albertus Magnus]], and he longs to discover the fabled [[elixir of life]]. He loses interest in both these pursuits and in [[science]] as a whole after seeing the remains of a tree struck by lightning; however, at the [[University of Ingolstadt]], Frankenstein develops a fondness for [[chemistry]], and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life in inanimate matter through artificial means, pursuing this goal for two years.

Assembling [[Frankenstein's monster|a humanoid creature]] through ambiguous means, Frankenstein successfully brings it to life, but he is horrified by the creature's ugliness. He flees his creation, who disappears and swears revenge on his creator. When William is found murdered, Frankenstein knows instantly that his creation is the killer, but says nothing. The Frankensteins' housekeeper, Justine, is blamed for the boy's death and executed; Frankenstein is wracked with guilt, but does not come forward with the truth because he thinks no one will believe his story, and he is afraid of the reactions such a story would provoke.

The creature approaches Frankenstein and begs him to create a female companion for him. Frankenstein agrees, but ultimately destroys this creation, aghast at the idea of a race of monsters. Enraged, the creature swears revenge; he kills Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend, and promises Frankenstein, &quot;You have denied me my wedding night - I will be with you on yours!&quot; The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth on her matrimonial bed. That same night, Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature.

Frankenstein pursues the &quot;fiend&quot; or &quot;[[Demon]]&quot; (as he calls his creation) to the [[Arctic]] with the intent of destroying it; he ultimately fails in his mission, as he falls through an [[Drift ice|ice floe]] and contracts severe [[pneumonia]]. He is rescued by a ship undergoing an expedition to the [[North Pole]], but dies after relating his tale to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. His creature, upon discovering the death of his creator, is overcome by sorrow and vows to commit [[suicide]] by burning himself alive in &quot;the Northernmost extremity of the globe&quot;; he then disappears, never to be seen or heard from again.

==Characterization==
{{Cleanup|section|date=January 2012}}
While many subsequent film adaptations (notably the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Hammer Films]] series starring [[Peter Cushing]]) have portrayed Frankenstein as the prototypical &quot;[[mad scientist]]&quot;, the novel portrayed him as a [[tragic hero|tragic figure]].

[[Percy Shelley]], Mary's husband, served as a major influence for the character. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sandy | first =Mark | title =Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire | work =[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]  | publisher =The Literary Dictionary Company | date =2002-09-20 | url =http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3010 | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that Percy was one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein; while a student at [[Eton College]], he had &quot;experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions&quot;, and his rooms at [[Oxford University]] were filled with scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) | publisher =Department of English, [[Dickinson College]] | work=Romantic Natural History | url =http://www.dickinson.edu/~nicholsa/Romnat/pbshelley.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy, politically connected country squire, and a descendant of Sir [[Bysshe Shelley]], 1st [[Shelley baronets|Baronet of Castle Goring]], and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Shelley#Ancestry]]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the novel, Frankenstein's family is one of the most distinguished of the Genevese republic and his ancestors were counselors and syndics. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Frankenstein had an adopted sister, named Elizabeth. On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley delivered a baby two months premature; the child died two weeks later. Soon after, Percy left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, with whom he was having an affair.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Journal 6 December''&amp;nbsp;– Very Unwell. Shelley &amp; Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places...A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his ''wife''.&quot; Quoted in Spark, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of Frankenstein's responsibility to the creature&amp;nbsp;– in some ways like that of a parent to a child&amp;nbsp;– is one of the main themes of the book.

Obsession plays a major role in the development of Frankenstein's character. First, as a child, he is obsessed with reading books on [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and many [[pseudo-sciences]]. Later, as a young man, he becomes enthralled with the study of [[life sciences]] - mainly dealing with death and the reanimation of corpses. Finally, after the monster is created, Frankenstein is consumed with guilt, despair, and regret, leading him to obsess over the nature of his creation.

==In other media==
{{In popular culture|section|date=January 2017}}
===Books===
Beside the original novel, the character also appears or is mentioned in other books from [[pastiche]]s to parodies.

* In the book ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt (novel)|Frankenstein's Aunt]]'', the Baron's aunt comes to Frankenstein's castle to put it back in order, following the chaos caused by her nephew's experiments. In the novel ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt Returns]]'', the doctor has created a child for the monster and his bride.
* In ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', Victor Frankenstein&amp;nbsp;– now going by the alias of Victor Helios&amp;nbsp;– has survived into the present, now living in [[New Orleans]] while arranging for the creation of his 'New Race' of humanity, now growing his creations in tanks after acquiring funding from the likes of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Fidel Castro]] over the centuries. His creations are mentally and emotionally defective, however, and Helios is forced to kill them, all while convinced that it is due to a flaw in his process rather than being able to acknowledge that his own warped views are the reasons his creations break down due to the hopelessness of their lives and inability to find their own purpose. He is opposed in his 'quest' by his original creation&amp;nbsp;– now called Deucalion, who has mastered the ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] due to the unique circumstances of his creation&amp;nbsp;– and two New Orleans detectives.
* In [[Kenneth Oppel]]'s novel ''This Dark Endeavor'' and its sequel ''Such Wicked Intent'', Frankenstein is portrayed as a 16-year-old aspiring scientist who creates his own creature from the body of his deceased twin brother, Konrad.

In the 2001 [[Curtis Jobling]] book, ''[[Frankenstein's Cat]]'', it features Frankenstein, sometime before creating his monster, creating a cat called Nine (named because he was made out of nine cats). This book was later adapted into a television series in 2007.

===Film===
[[File:Victor frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frankenstein (1910 film)|Victor Frankenstein (1910 film)]]]]

* Victor Frankenstein's first appearance on screen was in a [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|1910 film]] (produced by [[Thomas Edison]]) in which he seemed more a magician.
* The character's first significant film appearance was in [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], directed by [[James Whale]]. Here, the character is renamed '''Henry Frankenstein''' (a later film shows his tombstone bearing the name '''Heinrich von Frankenstein''') and is played by British actor [[Colin Clive]] opposite [[Boris Karloff]] as the monster. Clive reprised his role in the 1935 sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', which reunited Clive, Whale and Karloff, as well as first giving Frankenstein the official title of Baron. Although the character is not present in the following sequels due to Clive's death in 1937, an oil painting of Frankenstein (as portrayed by Clive) appears in 1939's ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; he is also the title character, in spite of having only a cameo, in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942).
* The character gained new life in 1957 when [[Peter Cushing]] first essayed the role (renamed &quot;'''[[Baron Victor von Frankenstein]]'''&quot;) in [[Hammer Films]]' ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'', opposite [[Christopher Lee]] as the Creature. Cushing went on to star as Victor Frankenstein, again identified as a Baron, in five more films for the studio. In contrast to the character portrayed in the novel and earlier films, Cushing's Frankenstein is a ruthless [[megalomania]]c who uses his creation to murder those who stand in his way.
* The 1967 film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' featured Baron Boris von Frankenstein (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]) who is based on Victor Frankenstein. Boris discovers the secret to total destruction and plans to reveal it to the Worldwide Organization of Monsters while announcing his retirement. He has a nephew named Felix Flanken, the son of his youngest sister (an expert in [[witchcraft]]) and a [[medicine man]].
* After Cushing temporarily retired from the role following 1969's ''[[Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed]]'', Hammer decided to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the series for the 1970s. ''[[The Horror of Frankenstein]]'' was a tongue-in-cheek [[black comedy]] remake of ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'', which featured [[Ralph Bates]] as a younger, &quot;hipper&quot; Baron in the sinister mold of Cushing's interpretation. After the film failed to be the success Hammer had hoped for, they brought Cushing back for one final film, in 1974's ''[[Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell]]''.
* The 1972 TV film ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'' (a &quot;prequel of sorts&quot; to ''Mad Monster Party?'') featured Baron Henry von Frankenstein (voiced by [[Bob McFadden]] impersonating Boris Karloff). In the TV film, Henry and his assistant [[Igor (character)|Igor]] construct and bring to life a female monster, intended to be the original creature's mate. Frankenstein goes to the Transylvania Astoria Hotel in order to make wedding arrangements.
* [[Udo Kier]] played Baron Victor Frankenstein in 1973's ''[[Flesh for Frankenstein]]''. This version of the character is a [[serial killer]] who is married to his own sister.
* [[Leonard Whiting]] played Victor Frankenstein in ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]]'' (1973).
* [[Robert Foxworth]] played Victor Frankenstein in a 1973 television adaptation ''[[Frankenstein (1973 film)|Frankenstein]]''.
* In [[Mel Brooks|Mel Brooks']] 1974 comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', [[Gene Wilder]] portrays [[Frederick Frankenstein]], grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who inherits the family estate but is ashamed of his grandfather's work (to the point of insisting that his name is pronounced &quot;Fronk-en-steen&quot;). He is ultimately inspired to take up the work, eventually creating his own monster (played by [[Peter Boyle]]).
* [[Barrett Oliver]] portrays a young version of Victor Frankenstein in 1984 short film ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', directed by [[Tim Burton]]. [[Charlie Tahan]] plays Victor in the [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|2012 animated remake]].
* [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] appeared as &quot;Charles&quot; Frankenstein in 1985's ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'' opposite [[Clancy Brown]] as the monster.
* [[Raul Julia]] portrayed Frankenstein in [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'' (1990) based on the Brian Aldiss novel.
* In 1992, a [[Frankenstein (1992 film)|made-for-TV film adaptation of ''Frankenstein'']] was produced by David Wickes for [[Turner Pictures]]. It starred [[Patrick Bergin]] as Victor and [[Randy Quaid]] as the monster. In this film, Victor clones himself instead of creating the creature from the dead. In this adaptation, Victor and the monster share a [[psychic]] link, and can sense each other's presence.
* [[Kenneth Branagh]] reinterpreted the character along the lines of Shelley's portrayal in ''[[Frankenstein (1994 film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]]'' (1994) opposite [[Robert De Niro]] as the monster.
* In the 1999 animated film, ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein]]'', Dr. Frankenstein is the main antagonist voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]. After secretly creating the monster in a roller coaster, his lab is discovered by the Chipmunks and sends his creation after them. After the creature had not returned, he goes to the Chipmunks' house and kidnaps Alvin. He then uses a formula that makes Alvin go out of control. After Alvin is returned to normal, Frankenstein in the disguise of the park's mascot Sammy the Squirrel tries to electrocute him, but is electrocuted by his own creation. When he regains conscious, he is unable to get the mask off him. Later near the end of the film, he appears as the theme park's entertainer.
* In the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', Victor Frankenstein (portrayed by [[Samuel West]]) is hired by [[Count Dracula]] to create the monster for Dracula to use to bring his offspring to life. When Frankenstein refuses, Dracula kills him, only to be attacked by the monster. The monster takes Frankenstein's body to the windmill, but an angry mob outside of the castle sees the monster and chases it to the windmill. They set fire to the windmill in order to kill the monster, but are chased off by Dracula and his [[Brides of Dracula|brides]]. The monster survives when the floor on top of the windmill caves in. The monster&amp;nbsp;– which refers to Frankenstein as his/its father&amp;nbsp;– is later used to bring Dracula's offspring to life, only to escape from the castle with help from monster hunter [[Gabriel Van Helsing]].
* The 2004 independent movie ''[[Frankenstein (2004 film)|Frankenstein]]'' features a Victor Frankenstein known as Victor Helios (portrayed by [[Thomas Kretschmann]]), who has used his own research to extend his life into the modern day, where he continues his experiments to create life with the goal of replacing humanity with his own creatures. He is opposed by his original creation, who is determined to defeat his creator while being hampered by a mental 'block' Helios has installed in all his creatures to prevent them harming him.
* The 2004 made-for-TV Hallmark production of ''Frankenstein'' starred [[Alec Newman]] as Victor Frankenstein opposite of [[Luke Goss]] as the monster.
* The 2007 film ''[[Frankenstein (2007 film)|Frankenstein]]'' introduces Victoria Frankenstein. Instead of making the creature out of corpses, she uses [[stem cell]]s, intending to use her experiment to save her dying son. The experiment goes wrong, however, and the creature escapes. When Frankenstein catches up with the monster, she comes to love it because it is her only remaining link to her son who has since died.
* Victor Frankenstein briefly appears in the 2014 film ''[[I, Frankenstein]]'', in which he is played by [[Aden Young]].
* Victor Frankenstein was portrayed by [[James McAvoy]] in the 2015 film ''[[Victor Frankenstein (film)|Victor Frankenstein]]''. In this version, he rescues Igor ([[Daniel Radcliffe]]) - formerly an unnamed hunchback from a circus who impressed Victor with his exceptional self-taught medical skills - to enlist him as his partner in creating life, later attributing his desire as a means of making up for a childhood incident where his elder brother died in a blizzard. Although Victor acknowledges that his first human creation has no true spark of life in it, the film concludes with him speculating how he shall improve his project for the future.

===Television===
* Victor Frankenstein is mentioned as the creator of [[Herman Munster]] of the series ''[[The Munsters]]'', but does not appear in the series. At Herman and Lily's wedding, Frankenstein gave Herman away &quot;with his blueprints.&quot; He is currently dead. In &quot;A Visit from Johann,&quot; (1966) the episode introduced the great great grandson of Victor Frankenstein named Victor Frankenstein IV (played by [[John Abbott (actor)|John Abbott]]).
* In ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' episode &quot;The Super Friends Meet Frankenstein,&quot; the Dr. Frankenstein (voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]) that is featured is depicted as the great-great-grandson of the original Dr. Frankenstein who carries on the &quot;family tradition&quot; of creating monsters. He is assisted by an Igor-like henchman named Gork (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]). Dr. Frankenstein uses his monsters to take revenge on the Transylvanians for what they did to his ancestor. When he unleashes the classic Frankenstein's monster to attack Transylvania, the Super Friends are called in to investigate. When [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] attack the monster, Dr. Frankenstein orders his creation to lure the Dynamic Duo to his castle in order to trap them. When Batman and Robin short-circuit Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Frankenstein arrives and traps them while thanking them for giving him an idea for his next creation. First, Dr. Frankenstein transfers Batman's abilities to the target body. Robin manages to escape and calls in [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. When the arrive, Dr. Frankenstein unleashes on them a tentacled, [[Kryptonite]]-powered, tar creature. Dr. Frankenstein then transfers Superman and Wonder Woman's abilities into the target body for his next monster. Thus creating a composite monster who has Batman's head, cape, and genius-level intellect, Superman's body and super abilities, and Wonder Woman's magic lasso, magic bracelets, and [[telepathy|telepathic]] powers. Dr. Frankenstein sends his Super-Monster to attack Europe while Robin and [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] free Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. With help from the Austrian Energy Research Institute, Robin undergoes the same experiment that created the Super-Monster granting him the powers of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Robin and the Super-Monster are evenly matched until Robin dons a lead suit and exposes the Super-Monster to Kryptonite. Robin defeats the Super-Monster while Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Gleek apprehend Dr. Frankenstein and Gork followed by them regaining their powers by reversing the experiment.
* The humorous TV series ''[[Frankenstein's Aunt]]'' features a Dr. Frankenstein who creates a typical Frankenstein's monster. As in the [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the character is renamed Henry Frankenstein (portrayed by [[Bolek Polívka]]).
* In ABC's fairy tale drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Dr. Frankenstein is one of many characters brought to the Storybrooke by [[Regina Mills|the Evil Queen]] under the alias Dr. Whale, and serves as a recurring character throughout the show's run. He works at the local hospital, and was responsible for creating the show's version of [[Frankenstein%27s_monster|the monster]] when he tries to resurrect his dead brother, Gerhardt. 
* The [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenhole]]'' features Dr. Victor Frankenstein (voiced by [[Jeff B. Davis]]) and other characters from both the novel ''Frankenstein'' and other classic horror films. Frankenstein is depicted as being a narcissist who, after drinking an immortality serum he invented, has lived for more than a thousand years. He has developed the technology to connect his village to various points in time, called Frankenholes, that allow various people from history to time travel to visit him in the hopes he will do some sort of miraculous surgery to fix physical and mental flaws.
* The 2014 [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' depicts Dr. Victor Frankenstein (played by [[Harry Treadaway]]) as a young morgue worker in England during the late 1800s. He creates his monster &quot;Caliban&quot; (played by [[Rory Kinnear]]) by attaching a cadaver to a system of circuits and running electricity through it during a lightning storm. Unlike other adaptions, Victor creates two more creations: Proteus and Lily.

===Theatre===
* The 2007 [[Off-Broadway]] musical, ''[[Frankenstein – A New Musical]]'' portrays Victor Frankenstein as the naïve young student of Mary Shelley's original novel.
* In 2011 the stage adaptation [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|''Frankenstein'']] (by [[Nick Dear]]) directed by Oscar winner [[Danny Boyle]] premiered at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London, starring [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]], with the two lead actors alternating the roles of Frankenstein his [[Frankenstein's monster|Creature]]. The play, with numerous awards and massively acclaimed by critics and audience, was live recorded twice, and has been broadcast to cinemas around the world as a part of the [[Royal National Theatre#National Theatre Live|National Theatre Live programme]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/16546-frankenstein |title=National Theatre Live programme / Broadcasts -  FRANKENSTEIN - with Benedict Cumberbatch &amp; Jonny Lee Miller - (directed by Danny Boyle) |work=[[National Theatre Live org.]] |year=2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] portraying the [[Frankenstein's monster|Creature]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]] Dr. Victor Frankenstein, and the alternate version with Cumberbatch playing the Doctor and Miller the [[Frankenstein's monster|Creature]].
* Also in 2011, a unique, musical adaptation called Frankenstein's Wedding: Live in Leeds was performed in front of a group of 12,000 at the Kirkstall Abbey. It incorporated footage, filmed prior to the performance, focusing mostly on Frankenstein (played by Andrew Gower)and his creation of the creature, with the live show focusing mainly on Frankenstein's wedding to Liz (played by Lacey Turner), and the tragic story that followed.

'''Frankenstein's monster''', sometimes known as '''Frankenstein''', is a fictional character who first appeared in [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2002/septemberoctober/feature/its-alive |title='It's Alive' |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], to the mythological character [[Prometheus]], who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.  Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature is often referred to by his creator's surname, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

In Shelley's [[Gothic fiction|Gothic story]], Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his [[laboratory]] through an ambiguous method consisting of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. Shelley describes the monster as {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, hideously ugly, but sensitive and emotional.  The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], the monster occupies &quot;a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Caroll, Joseph et al.  ''Graphing Jane Austen: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30 p. 30] (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namelessness==
[[File:Frankenstein Cooke 1823.jpg|thumb|left|The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|T. P. Cooke]] as the monster in an 1823 stage production of Shelley's novel]]

Mary Shelley's original novel never ascribes an actual name to the monster; although when speaking to his creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], the monster does call himself the &quot;[[Adam]] of your labours&quot; (in reference to the first man created in the [[Bible]]).  Victor refers to the monster as &quot;creature&quot;, &quot;fiend&quot;, &quot;spectre&quot;, &quot;the [[demon]]&quot;, &quot;wretch&quot;, &quot;[[devil]]&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, and &quot;[[ogre]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldick|first=Chris|title=In Frankenstein's shadow: myth, monstrosity, and nineteenth-century writing|year=1987|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|id=ISBN 0198117264 |isbn=9780198117261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become common vernacular to refer to the creature by the name &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, though this never actually happens in the book.

As in Shelley's story, the monster's namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in London and Paris during the decades after the novel's first appearance.  In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of ''[[Richard Brinsley Peake|Presumption]]'', the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. &quot;The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of [[dramatis personae]] came _________, by Mr T. Cooke,&quot; she wrote to her friend [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]]. &quot;This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good.&quot;&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=George E.|title=Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form|year=1989|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park|id=ISBN 0271006455|isbn=9780271006451|pages=37|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/haggerty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade of publication, the name of the creator—Frankenstein—was used to refer to the monster, but it did not become firmly established until much later. The story was adapted for the stage in 1927 by [[Peggy Webling]],&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchcock|first=Susan Tyler|title=Frankenstein: a cultural history|year=2007|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393061444|id=ISBN 0393061442}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Webling's Victor Frankenstein does give the creature his name. However, the monster has no name in the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] film series starring [[Boris Karloff]] during the 1930s, which was largely based upon Webling's play.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William and Young, Nancy.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrK1dFXqT78C&amp;pg=PA199 ''The 1930s''], p. 199 (Greenwood Publishing Group 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 Universal film]] treated the monster's identity in a similar way as Shelley's novel: in the opening credits, the character is referred to merely as &quot;The Monster&quot; (the actor's name is replaced by a question mark, but Karloff is listed in the closing credits).&lt;ref&gt;Schor, Esther. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0QeWS3z0BwC&amp;pg=PA82 ''The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley''], p. 82 (Cambridge U. Press 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the creature soon enough became best known in the popular imagination as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard the monster sense of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as well-established and not an error.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Bergen|title=Comfortable Words|year=1962|publisher=New York|location=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=A dictionary of modern American usage|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|id=ISBN 0195078535|isbn=9780195078534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern practice varies somewhat. For example, in ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', first published in 2004, the creature is named &quot;Deucalion&quot;, after the [[Deucalion|character]] from [[Greek Mythology]], who is the son of the titan [[Prometheus]], a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which first aired in 2014; Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation &quot;Adam&quot;, before deciding instead to let the monster &quot;pick his own name&quot;. Thumbing through a book of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the monster chooses &quot;Proteus&quot; from ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the ''second'' monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named &quot;Caliban&quot;, from ''[[The Tempest]]'', by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet [[John Clare]].

==Shelley's plot==
[[Image:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Stanton Ogle]] in the 1910 film version.]]
{{main|Frankenstein}}
As told by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguously described [[scientific method]] consisting of [[chemistry]] (from his time as a student at [[University of Ingolstadt]]) and [[alchemy]] (largely based on the writings of [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]). Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness. 

He finds brief solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of [[peasant]]s.  Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family's [[blindness|blind]] father, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Hopeful but bewildered, the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her. He finds Frankenstein's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory, and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him. 

The monster kills Victor's younger brother William upon learning of the boy's relation to his hated creator. When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate. In return, he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail. Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys his experiment. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride [[Elizabeth Lavenza]] on their wedding night; whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation. Searching for the monster in the [[Arctic Circle]], Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe [[pneumonia]]. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship; but, upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at &quot;the Northernmost extremity of the globe&quot;. He then departs, never to be seen again.

==Appearance==
[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|[[Boris Karloff]] as the classic 1930s film version with an assist from [[makeup artist]] [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]]]
Shelley described Frankenstein's monster as an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, hideously ugly creation, with translucent yellowish skin pulled so taut over the body that it &quot;barely disguised the workings of the arteries and muscles underneath&quot;; watery, glowing eyes, flowing black hair, black lips, and prominent white teeth. The monster attempts to integrate himself into human society, but is shunned by all who see him. This compels him to seek revenge against his creator. A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.

The best-known image of Frankenstein's monster in [[popular culture]] derives from [[Boris Karloff]]'s portrayal in the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' in which he wore makeup applied, and according to a format designed by, [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack P. Pierce]] and possibly suggested by director [[James Whale]]. [[Universal Studios]], which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] took over the part from Karloff in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]];'' [[Bela Lugosi]] portrayed the role in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]];'' and [[Glenn Strange]] played the monster in the last three [[Universal Studios]] films to feature the character - ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]],'' ''[[House of Dracula]],'' and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].'' But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. To this day, the image of Karloff's face is owned by his daughter's company, Karloff Enterprises, for which Universal replaced Karloff's features with Glenn Strange's in most of their marketing.

Since Karloff's portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, [[undead]]-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OyVey&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey!: how Jewish history, culture, and values shaped the comic book superhero | publisher=Leviathan Press | year=2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | pages=82–97 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 TV mini-series ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]],'' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster: [[Michael Sarrazin]] appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.

In the 1994 film ''[[Frankenstein (1994 film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]],'' the creature is played by [[Robert De Niro]] in a nearer approach to the original source, except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, [[Doctor Waldman]], while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman's &quot;trace memories&quot; that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.

In the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]],'' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is {{convert|8|to-|9|ft|cm}} tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart. It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs, essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.

In 2004, a TV mini-series adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein (US TV miniseries)|Frankenstein]]'' was made by [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]]. [[Luke Goss]] plays The Creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.

The 2014 TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of Shelley's description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. In this series, the monster names himself &quot;[[Caliban]]&quot;, after the character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.

==Personality==
[[File:House of Frankenstein (Strange and Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Glenn Strange]] as Frankenstein's monster with [[Boris Karloff]], this time playing another character, in the 1944 film ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'']]
As depicted by Shelley, the monster is a sensitive, emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'', and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.

From the beginning, the monster is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his &quot;birth&quot; that even his own creator cannot stand being around him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says &quot;…one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped…&quot;.&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;{{cite web|last=Shelley|first=Mary Wollstonecraft|title=Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm|work=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.5}} Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too cannot stand to see himself. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.

Contrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well. The ''Van Helsing'' and ''Penny Dreadful'' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character's violent reactions to rejection.

In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the monster is depicted as [[Muteness|mute]] and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal's &quot;abnormal&quot; brain. In the subsequent sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. In the second sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', but the dialogue was excised before release. The monster was effectively mute in later sequels, though he is heard to refer to [[Count Dracula]] as his &quot;master&quot; in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. The monster is often portrayed as being [[Pyrophobia|afraid of fire]].

==The monster as a metaphor==
[[File:Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin (5282830195).jpg|thumb|Frankenstein's monster's bust in the [[National Museum of Cinema]] of [[Turin]], [[Italy]].]]
Scholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley’s story, and have analogized the monster to a motherless child; Shelley’s own mother died while giving birth to her.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;Milner, Andrew. ''Literature, Culture and Society,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9C1Xdzyx4C&amp;pg=PA227 227, 230] (Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized &quot;the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.&quot;&lt;ref name=Milner /&gt;  Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled technology.&lt;ref&gt;Coghill, Jeff.  ''CliffsNotes on Shelley's Frankenstein,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHM5oZd8WkC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30] (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposal is that the character of Dr. Frankenstein was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus--[[Benjamin Franklin]]. Accordingly, the monster would represent the new nation that Franklin helped to create out of remnants left by England.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;Young, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=65fCSOpahAwC&amp;pg=PA34 Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor], p. 34 (NYU Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Frankenstein's father &quot;made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds,&quot; wrote Shelley, similar to Franklin's famous [[kite experiment]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

&quot;'''Frankie Teardrop'''&quot; is a song by [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] from the band's acclaimed first album ''[[Suicide (1977 album)|Suicide]]'', which was released in 1977. The song tells a story of a young father and [[poverty]]-stricken [[factory worker]] whose destitution drives him to [[insanity]]. One day, Frankie comes home from work, murders his wife and child, and then commits [[suicide]]. The narrative then continues to follow him into [[hell]]. The musical backing on the song is sparse, featuring just a simple keyboard [[riff]], [[drum machine]], and the vocal line, creating a chilling atmosphere. Singer [[Alan Vega]]'s &quot;Dark, inhuman screams&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/suicide-first-album-r19328/review/|title=Suicide (first album) review on Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; add to the [[claustrophobic]] nature of the piece.

==Reviews==
The track received many reviews due to both its disturbing nature ([[Nick Hornby]] in his book ''[[31 Songs]]'' described it as something you would listen to &quot;Only once&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hornby&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=31 Songs|author=Nick Hornby|publisher=McSweeney's}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for its political viewpoint, by [[Allmusic]] as &quot;More literally and poetically political than the work of bands who wore their radical philosophies on their sleeve&quot;. [[Bruce Springsteen]] has cited that he loves this song in interviews, and that it was an influence on his album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Ward|title=State Trooper - Bruce Springsteen|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/state-trooper-mt0008672556|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] cited it as &quot;[The track that] gets most of the ink&quot; in terms of critical acclaim, and jokingly as &quot;[[Taxi Driver (film)|''Taxi Driver'']]: The Musical&quot; when citing the album ''Suicide'' in its 100 Greatest ’70s Albums list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/7/|title=Pitchfork's top 100 of the 1970's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Miles &quot;C-Note&quot; Franklin''', played by [[Rockmond Dunbar]], is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United States|American]] [[television series]], ''[[Prison Break]]''. The character was introduced as a prisoner in the [[Pilot (Prison Break episode)|pilot episode]]. The actor was promoted from a recurring guest star to a regular cast member midway through the first season.

==Background==
Franklin was a [[First Sergeant]] in the [[U.S. Army]], stationed in [[Kuwait]]. While serving as a guard for a detention facility, he uncovered a shocking practice (illegally torturing several detainees) and reported it to his commander. C-Note's commander [[dishonorably discharged]] him for his involvement in black-market activities after C-Note refused to agree to keep quiet about the incident. With the shame of dishonorable discharge hanging over him, C-Note had great difficulty finding other jobs to support his wife Kacee and daughter Dede, so he resorted to criminal means. His brother-in-law, Darius Morgan ([[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]]) was a truck driver and suggested that he could help transport stolen goods. Eventually, C-Note was caught and because he would not give up the identities of his friends, he was sent to [[Fox River State Penitentiary]]. He told his wife and daughter that he was getting shipped back to [[Iraq]] (as he had not even told them of his discharge from the Army). He begged his [[brother-in-law]] not to let them know he was going to be imprisoned. Once inside Fox River, C-Note eventually starts working in the prison kitchen and gains a reputation as the &quot;prison pharmacist&quot;, being able to acquire any item or substance for other inmates for $100, or a &quot;C-Note&quot; (which, in conjunction with his namesake's appearance on the bill, spawns his nickname).

==Appearances==
C-Note's first appearance in the series was in the pilot and was a recurring character in the first 2 episodes.  According to an interview with Rockmond Dunbar C-Note was only supposed to appear in these 2 episodes but when the show was picked up for a full season C-Note's role was extended to a recurring character after the thirteenth episode of the first season.

=== Season 1 ===
C-Note makes his first appearance in the pilot episode when [[Michael Scofield]] asks him to obtain some [[PUGNAc]] to allow Michael to feign [[diabetes]] and thus gain access to the infirmary (a critical aspect of his escape plan). C-Note is curious to know his motives, but Michael refuses to tell him. In &quot;[[Allen (Prison Break episode)|Allen]]&quot;, C-Note refuses to deal with Michael after seeing him associating with [[Theodore &quot;T-Bag&quot; Bagwell|T-Bag]], leader of a [[white supremacist]] group in the prison. He later reconsiders after seeing Michael apparently fighting one of T-Bag's men during a riot, though his curiosity is not diminished. C-Note is then absent for six episodes, but eventually returns to the show with a minor role in the episode &quot;[[Tweener (Prison Break episode)|Tweener]]&quot;, where he becomes suspicious of the PI crew when he realizes that they are discarding pieces of concrete across the prison yard, from the hole they are digging in the break room. C-Note plays a bigger role in the next episode &quot;[[Sleight of Hand (Prison Break episode)|Sleight of Hand]].&quot; After the PI head, [[List of Prison Break characters#John Abruzzi|John Abruzzi]] is briefly replaced by Gus Fiorello, C-Note bribes him to work in PI. He quickly discovers the hole that Michael and his crew had dug as part of the escape plan. When Abruzzi regained control of PI, C-Note threatens the crew to let him on board or he would tell the guards. The others reluctantly agree. He is initially a source of friction on the team, often questioning other characters’ actions, and in the episode &quot;[[Odd Man Out (Prison Break episode)|Odd Man Out]]&quot; he attempts to conspire against Michael by turning his cellmate, [[Fernando Sucre]], against him. 

C-Note is one of six inmates involved in the first failed escape attempt in &quot;[[End of the Tunnel (Prison Break episode)|End of the Tunnel]].&quot; In the same episode, it is revealed that the character has a wife and daughter on the outside, whom he has tricked into thinking that he is serving in the military overseas. When Abruzzi is temporarily written out of the show, C-Note replaces him as a main character from episode 14 and onwards. He later becomes a respected member of the team in the season’s later episodes, helping the team out of several problems that nearly derails the escape plan. He also befriends fellow escapee [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Charles Westmoreland|Charles Westmoreland]] as they both share the same need to see their family again. One consequence of his joining the escape team, however, is C-Note being ostracized by other black inmates, ironically for the same reason C-Note had initially refused to deal with Michael: consorting with T-Bag, who had also joined the escape team. This becomes a plot point in &quot;[[Bluff (Prison Break episode)|Bluff]]&quot;, and the subplot continues through the next few episodes. C-Note has two violent encounters with his former associates and Trumpets, the leader of one of the black gangs, issues a death mark on his head in the episode &quot;Go.&quot; Only the escape prevents him from being killed. After the &quot;Fox River Eight's&quot; escape from the prison, C-Note, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre and Abruzzi meet bigger problems as their escape plane takes off and leaves them stranded with numerous police on their trail, forcing them to run into the woods in a desperate attempt to evade their pursuers.

=== Season 2 ===

In the second season, C-Note’s storyline alternates between his participation in the search for Westmoreland’s money, as well as a separate subplot in which the character seeks to reunite with his family. After parting ways with the other escapees in &quot;Otis&quot;, C-Note travels to Utah and eventually reunites with other members of the Fox River Eight in &quot;Subdivision.&quot; In these episodes, C-Note returns to his earlier role as the one who instigates tension amongst the escape team, especially between him and T-Bag. The fugitives spend several episodes digging for the money and ultimately find it. However, C-Note and the others are apparently betrayed by Sucre, who double crosses them all and demands the money while holding them at gun point. Left empty-handed, C-Note returns to Chicago, where he attempts to re-unite with his family in &quot;Unearthed.&quot;

Made aware of his fugitive status in the episode &quot;[[Scan (Prison Break episode)|Scan]]&quot;, his wife Kacee is very upset to learn the truth and is initially uncertain if she should stay loyal to her husband. However, she later decides to stand by him. In the episode &quot;[[Unearthed (Prison Break episode)|Unearthed]]&quot;, C-Note meets up with his old friends and asks them for help to escape with Kacee and Dede. They are narrowly able to avoid capture by federal agents, and C-Note is reunited with his wife and daughter at the end of the episode.

After being absent for 2 episodes, C-Note and his family resurfaces in North Dakota, in the episode &quot;[[Disconnect (Prison Break episode)|Disconnect]]&quot;, having a good time until his daughter complains of stomach problems as they have left her medicine behind. Kacee attempts to purchase more medication at a nearby pharmacy, but is identified by the clerk and taken into police custody. C-Note, horrified, can only watch in shock from his hiding place as his wife is arrested and taken away. In the season’s later episodes, the character becomes increasingly desperate. In &quot;[[John Doe (Prison Break episode)|John Doe]]&quot;, a guilt-ridden C-Note attempts to have his wife skip bail, only to learn that Kacee's bail is denied. The episodes &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; then focuses on C-Note trying to take care of his daughter. In &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, he attempts to find medical care for the increasingly ill Dede. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Mahone has received a report that C-Note was spotted in Minnesota and arrives to pursue him. At the end of the episode, Dede’s health rapidly deteriorates, and C-Note is forced to give himself up to save his daughter’s life. He also makes a deal with Agent Mahone to release his wife in exchange for C-Note’s co-operation with trying to find Michael Scofield. In his last scene of the episode, C-Note is being led away in handcuffs.

His last three episodes feature C-Note in custody and unsuccessfully trying to help Mahone to track down Michael. After Mahone no longer has need for C-Note, he is pressured by the nefarious Company to ensure C-Note’s death. Mahone reluctantly urges C-Note to hang himself, threatening his family if he does not obey. The episode ends with a cliffhanger as C-Note attempts to hang himself in his cell. In the next episode, however, he is rescued by the guards. Mahone’s subordinate, Agent Wheeler, then questions C-Note and promises him protection in exchange for his testimony against Mahone. In the episode &quot;Panama&quot;, C-Note agrees to the deal put forward by Wheeler and Internal Affairs Agent Sullins. In return, C-Note is released from prison and placed in the [[Witness Protection Program]] with his family. In his last scene of the season, C-Note is seen walking away with his wife and daughter to start a new life. The actor retains his name in the opening credits for the last two episodes of season 2, but does not appear. &quot;Panama&quot; is his last appearance as a regular cast member. He is the first principal character to have been written out without being killed off from the series and the first member of the Fox River Eight to be set free by the authorities.

=== Season 4 ===
Rockmond Dunbar reprises his role in the last two episodes of Prison Break. After he tracks down Sucre, C-Note explains that he is on the run again due to Internal Affairs refusing to hold up their end of the deal and that he has been contacted by a mysterious man (Paul Kellerman) and asked to locate Michael and Lincoln to help them destroy The Company. In the series finale, C-Note and Sucre save the brothers from certain death and later receive full exoneration for their efforts. In the series epilogue, C-Note is revealed to have become a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] deliveryman, matching his specialty in prison: to get his fellow inmates any random material.

=== Characteristics ===
As one of the Fox River Eight escapees, C-Note's main specialty revolves around being able to smuggle any random material in and out of any given territory. Apparently, this was also notified by his commanding officer right before he was dishonorably discharged. He also has an observant side about him, as he is the only one whom Scofield reluctantly recruited for the escape to have figured out what Abruzzi's PI crew were conducting on the break room on his own. While he genuinely respects Scofield as the man who broke them out of jail, C-Note, like any other father, cares more for his family and going even as far as handing Michael out to Mahone in exchange for his family's safety as well as attempting a suicide. When Roy Geary smugly stole an object of sentimental value from Westmoreland (whom C-Note forced into handing over to keep the plan safe), his immediate expression was anger. Franklin is a Muslim.

==Production details==
C-Note reporting the abuse of prisoners of war in Kuwait was inspired by the [[Abu Ghraib scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Episode commentary by Paul Scheuring, cast and crew, S1E16, &quot;[[Brother's Keeper (Prison Break episode)|Brother's Keeper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DedhamHistory}}

'''Jason Fairbanks''' (September 25, 1780 &amp;ndash; September 10, 1801) was an [[United States|American]] [[murderer]]. Fairbanks came from a prominent family in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]]. He was the son of Ebenezer and Prudence Farrington Fairbanks and lived in the [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]], today the oldest wood-framed house in the country. He was born with a lame arm. His sixth cousin, once removed, was Vice President [[Charles W. Fairbanks|Charles Fairbanks]].

==History==
Fairbanks had been courting Elizabeth Fales, the daughter of Nehemiah Fales, although she was resistant to marrying him. Finally on May 18, 1801, Fairbanks was determined to force her to make up her mind. He met with Fales in a birch grove next to &quot;Mason's pasture&quot; in Dedham, though the exact location today is not known.

Later, Fairbanks appeared at the Fales house, covered with blood and holding a knife. He told them that their daughter had committed suicide and he had tried to do the same but could not. She had been stabbed 11 times, including once in the back.

Fairbanks' wounds were serious; he was in no shape to be taken directly to jail. He was therefore taken into the Fales household, where he received medical treatment. On August 8, 1801, after a three-day trial and Elizabeth Fales' funeral on May 20, a jury indicted Fairbanks as an accessory to her death and he was jailed.

[[James Sullivan (governor)|James Sullivan]], the [[Attorney General of Massachusetts]], handled the prosecution. [[Harrison Gray Otis (lawyer)|Harrison Gray Otis]] and [[John Lowell, Jr. (lawyer)|John Lowell, Jr.]], two prominent [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] lawyers, defended Fairbanks. He was found guilty of the murder and was sentenced to death by hanging.

Before the execution could take place, Fairbanks escaped with the help of his brother, a cousin, a friend, and his nephew, Nathaniel Davis. A $1,000 bounty was placed on his head, and a newspaper headline screamed &quot;Stop the Murderer!&quot; The party tried to make their way to Canada, but stopped to eat in Skenesboro, now known as [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall, New York]], just south of the Canada–US border. Fairbanks was recaptured.
 
Fairbanks was returned to the [[Boston]] jail, for authorities no longer trusted the Dedham jail, and on September 10, 1801, Fairbanks was hanged at a massive event. He was twenty years old. Two Army cavalry companies and a volunteer militia unit made sure he did not escape again, and the 10,000 people who showed up at the Town Common to witness the execution were five times the town’s population at the time.

Within two days of his execution, the ''Report of the Trial of Jason Fairbanks'' was published. The story was then written up in a pamphlet entitled ''A Deed of Horror! Trial of Jason Fairbanks for the Murder of His Sweetheart'' in 1801. It became the basis for a novel called ''The Life of Jason Fairbanks: A Novel Founded on Fact'', which is believed to no longer exist.

==Case==
Fairchild was arrested for the 2 February 1983 kidnapping, rape, and murder of Marjorie Mason, a 22-year-old [[United States Air Force]] [[nurse]], after police received information from a confidential informant implicating Fairchild and his brother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4586 &quot;Barry Lee Fairchild (Trial and Execution of)&quot;] Accessed 14 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, he recanted his two [[videotape]]d confessions, claiming that [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]] [[Sheriff]] [[Tommy F.

'''Maznah Ismail''' (1 January 1956–2 November 2001), better known as '''Mona Fandey''', was a pop singer, [[witch doctor]], and a murderer from [[Malaysia]]. She was executed on 2 November 2001 at the age of 45, after being convicted of the [[murder]] of a politician, Mazlan Idris, in 1993.

==The murder==
After leaving the music business, she became involved in spiritual witchcraft activities and was known to be a ''[[bomoh]]'', a local [[shamanism|shaman]]. She began offering her services to clients, mostly from the upper-class society. She also claimed to have provided politician clients in the ruling party with a variety of charms and talismans.

It was reported that Mazlan Idris, a state assemblyman for the [[Parliamentary constituencies and state assemblies of Malaysia|constituency]] of [[Batu Talam]] in the state of [[Pahang]], wanted to boost his political career and sought the services of Mona for assistance. Mazlan was educated in the [[United States]] and was an ambitious politician from the ruling [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party. At that time, Mona worked with her husband Mohamad Nor Affandi Abdul Rahman, 44, and their assistant Juraimi Hassan, 31. Mona and her husband promised to help Mazlan by giving him a talisman consisting of a cane and ''[[sbatmi]]'' headgear which was supposedly owned by former [[Indonesia]]n President [[Sukarno]]. Mona convinced Mazlan that he would be &quot;invincible&quot; if he held the talisman.&lt;ref name=star&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/7/25/lifeliving/20070725170304&amp;sec=lifeliving &quot;Black magic mayhem&quot;], ''The Star'', 25 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Mona demanded [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 2.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;kyodo&quot; /&gt; Mazlan paid the couple RM 500,000 as deposit, and gave them 10 land titles as surety for the remaining RM 2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot; /&gt;

An appointment was made for cleansing rituals to be performed at Mona's house. Mazlan was told to lie on the floor face up while Mona placed flowers on him. She then told Mazlan to close his eyes and wait for the money to &quot;fall from the sky&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mona&quot; /&gt; Juraimi then, using an axe, chopped Mazlan's head off. They also dismembered and partially skinned Mazlan's body. His body was found in 18 parts buried in a storeroom near Mona's house in Kampung Peruas, Ulu Dong, Raub [[Pahang]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot; /&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Mazlan was reported missing on 2 July 1993 after withdrawing RM 300,000 from a bank. After the murder, Mona was reported to have been on a shopping spree where she bought a Mercedes-Benz and had a [[Rhytidectomy|facelift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kyodo&quot; /&gt; It was alleged that the murder occurred between 10:00 PM and 12 midnight on 18 July 1993. On 22 July 1993, police found Mazlan's body; Mona, her husband, and Juraimi were arrested and a highly publicised trial began. They were tried in [[Temerloh]] High Court by a 7-person jury (trial by jury was abolished from 1 January 1995). The High Court found all three of them guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced them to death]] by [[hanging]]. Mona and the others filed appeals to the Federal Court and in 1999 the court dismissed their appeals and upheld the death sentence. Finally, the three convicts sought to obtain a [[pardon]] or clemency from the Pardons Board of Pahang, their final chance redemption. However, the board refused to give clemency. The three were given a [[last meal]] of [[KFC]] on the night before their execution. Mona, Affandy, and Juraimi were finally hanged on 2 November 2001 at [[Kajang Prison]]. A prison official said the trio expressed no remorse at the pre-dawn execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1634584.stm &quot;Malaysia hangs three for witchcraft murder.&quot;], ''BBC News'', 2 November 2001. Accessed 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the trial, Mona exhibited strange behaviour including appearing cheerful, constantly smiling and posing for press photographers. She dressed extravagantly with bright and colourful designs on her dress.&lt;ref name=kyodo&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2001_Nov_5/ai_80631363 &quot;Malaysian trio hanged for ritual murder&quot;], ''Kyodo News International'', 5 November 2001. Accessed 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She also remarked, &quot;looks like I have many fans&quot;.&lt;ref name=nst&gt;[http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/20070805082530/Article/index_html &quot;Butchered like animals&quot;], ''New Straits Times'', 5 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that during her execution she uttered the words &quot;''aku takkan mati''&quot;, meaning &quot;I will never die&quot;, and was still calm and smiling.&lt;ref name=mona&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/richard.clark32@btinternet.com/fandey.html Mona Fandey. A modern witchcraft murder.], ''Capital Punishment U.K''. Accessed 14 August 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504231145/http://www.geocities.com/richard.clark32@btinternet.com/fandey.html |date=4 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last female executed in Malaysia had been Tan Bee Lee in 1994 for a drug trafficking offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/femhanged.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Mona Fandey gained more notoriety than she had been when she was still a pop singer. There was wide local and even international media coverage and plenty of public interest. Anti-death penalty movements including [[Amnesty International]] voiced their opposition to the execution of the trio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA280042001?open&amp;of=ENG-376 &quot;Malaysia: Imminent execution&quot;], ''Amnesty International''. Accessed 14 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Malaysian film director [[Amir Muhammad (director)|Amir Muhammad]] made a short film entitled ''Mona'' in his ''6horts'' series. In 2006, a film by [[Dain Iskandar Said]] entitled ''[[Dukun (film)|Dukun]]'' was widely assumed to be based on Mona Fandey. This highly anticipated film has not been released as of December 2011 and will most likely not be released for public screenings due to concerns relating to the contents of the film, the relationship with Mona Fandey, and the implications for her family.&lt;ref&gt;Koay, Allan, [http://thestaronline.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/3/nation/17899129&amp;sec=nation &quot;Will Dukun ever charm viewers?&quot;], ''The Star'', 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mona Fandey affair was one of the last [[jury trial]]s to be conducted in Malaysia. The sensational nature of the case contributed toward the government's decision to discontinue the jury system. All trials by jury were abolished on 1 January 1995.

'''Joseph Stanley Faulder''' (19 October 1937 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1999) was the first [[Canada|Canadian]] citizen to be [[execution|executed]] in the [[United States]] since 1952.

Stanley Faulder, a [[Jasper, Alberta]] native, was convicted of murdering Inez Scarborough Phillips, a 75-year-old woman, in [[Texas]] in 1975 during a robbery in her house. He was caught, convicted, and sentenced to death in 1977.

Despite diplomatic complaints by the Canadian government, Faulder was executed by lethal injection on 17 June 1999.

His last appeal was rejected about an hour before his death.

'''Victor Harry Feguer''' (1935&amp;nbsp;– March 15, 1963) was a convicted murderer and the last [[federal inmate]] [[capital punishment|executed]] in the United States before the moratorium on the death penalty following ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', and the last person put to death in the state of [[Iowa]]. While at the time the news media paid little attention to Victor Feguer or his execution, [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s execution sparked renewed media interest in Feguer.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

==Background==
Feguer was a drifter, native to the state of [[Michigan]]. In the summer of 1960, Feguer arrived in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], renting a room at a decrepit boarding house. Soon after arriving, Feguer began phoning [[physician]]s alphabetically from the local [[Yellow Pages]] and found Dr. Edward Bartels. Feguer claimed that a woman needed medical attention. When Dr. Bartels arrived, Feguer kidnapped him and killed him in [[Illinois]]. Bartels' body was found in a cornfield there with a single gunshot to the head. A few days later, Feguer was arrested in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], after trying to sell Dr. Bartels' car.

Authorities believe that Feguer had kidnapped and killed Dr. Bartels in order to gain access to any drugs that Bartels may have carried to treat patients. Because Feguer transported his hostage across state lines, federal charges were filed against Feguer. In his defense, Feguer claimed that a drug addict from [[Chicago]], whom Feguer met in Dubuque, had actually murdered Bartels. Feguer claimed that he killed the drug addict and dumped his body in the [[Mississippi River]]. However, authorities could not find any evidence that this other person ever existed.

Feguer was tried and convicted in federal court for these crimes. He was sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. Feguer submitted an appeal, which was denied. At that point, only President [[John F. Kennedy]] could have commuted the death sentence. Iowa's governor, [[Harold Hughes]], a death penalty opponent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase&quot;/&gt; along with Feguer's attorney, contacted Kennedy to request clemency for Feguer. Kennedy thought that the crime was so brutal that he denied their request. 

==Feguer's last days==
===Feguer on Death Row at Fort Madison===
Victor Feguer was held at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|federal penitentiary at Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]]. He was brought back to Iowa because Leavenworth was not set up at the time to perform executions.

On March 5, 1963, Feguer was brought to the [[Iowa State Penitentiary]] at [[Fort Madison, Iowa]] and placed in the state's death row to await execution. He remained there for the next ten days until his execution was carried out. He spent those ten days quietly; guards felt he was a model prisoner.

===March 15, 1963===
For his [[last meal]], Feguer requested a single olive with the pit still in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-06-09/lifestyle/0106080426_1_bartels-victor-wife|title=Last Man To Die: Who Was Victor Feguer? |date=June 9, 2001 |author=Kate Santich |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, 1963, Feguer sat in an all-night vigil with a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. Between 4 and 5 in the morning of March 15, Feguer was given a new suit for his execution. Two guards escorted him to the gallows, and he was hanged at dawn. The witnesses included an [[Associated Press]] journalist and [[John Ely (Iowa politician)|John Ely]], then a member of the [[Iowa House of Representatives]], whose witnessing of the execution reinforced his opposition to the death penalty, leading him to work to abolish the state death penalty in Iowa, which occurred in 1965,&lt;ref name=&quot;Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/06/us/federal-executions-have-been-rare-but-may-increase.html |title=Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase |first=Carey |last=Goldberg |date=May 6, 2001 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which had no effect on the federal law under which Feguer had been executed.

The body was removed by a local [[funeral home]]. Victor Feguer's death certificate listed &quot;fracture cervical spinal column&quot; as the cause of death. Feguer was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Madison, wearing a second new suit that was provided for his burial.

==Aftermath==
Victor Feguer would be the last person to be executed in Iowa. After Feguer's death, it would be nearly 40 years until the next federal execution – that of [[Timothy McVeigh]], carried out on June 11, 2001, in [[Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]].

Iowa abolished [[capital punishment]] for all crimes in 1965. Over the years, several attempts had been made to reinstate the [[death penalty]] in Iowa. This became a major issue in the 1994 election, as a young girl had recently been murdered, as well as in 2005 after the murder of another young girl. However, the legislature declined to reinstate the death penalty.

Previous Iowa Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] made it clear that he would [[veto]] legislation that would restore the death penalty, even if it would only be on a limited basis. {{As of|2013}}, Iowa is one of 18 U.S. states to have completely abolished [[capital punishment]].

'''Ellis Wayne Felker''' (c. 1948 &amp;ndash; November 15, 1996) was convicted and [[executed]] for murder.

==History==
Felker was convicted for aggravated sodomy in 1977 and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment, but was paroled after four.&lt;ref&gt;Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 655 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis Wayne Felker was convicted and executed for the 1981 disappearance and murder of a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] woman, Evelyn Joy Ludlam. Ludlam was working her way through college as a cocktail waitress. Felker invited her to meet with him under the pretense of a job opportunity at his leather shop, which Joy Ludlam was attracted to because of the contradiction between her job and her religious beliefs.  He was put under police surveillance for 2 weeks (because, when Ludlam's car was found abandoned in Warner Robins, there was a datebook with an entry mentioning a meeting with Felker later in the day after her last sighting), during which time Ludlam's body was found in a creek, raped, and murdered by asphyxiation.

===Controversy===
An [[autopsy]] performed determined that Ludlam had been dead for 5 days when found.  This finding would eliminate Felker as a suspect due to his surveillance, however the findings were changed.  Later study of the autopsy notes by independent analysis showed that Ludlam had been dead no more than 3 days when found. However, since Ludlam's body was found in running water in late autumn, the exact time of death was difficult to determine. Dr Whitaker testified for the state that the air temperature, the state of decomposition, the fact that Ludham had been found wearing the same clothes as when she was last seen, and the fact that missing and murdered persons die soon after they disappear would suggest that Ludham had died 2 weeks before her body was found.

In September 1996, as a result of an Open Records Act lawsuit, Felker's attorneys received boxes of evidence that had been unlawfully withheld by the prosecution (although Felker's Brady claims arising from this evidence were rejected). This evidence included possible [[DNA]] samples of the perpetrator{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}, a witness statement to having seen Ludham after Felker claimed to have last seen her (although the witness did identify Felker as being with the victim at that time) and a signed confession made in 1988 by another suspect who was mentally retarded and contained numerous discrepancies. For example, describing Ludham as a security guard rather than a cocktail waitress, and claiming to have stabbed rather than strangled Ludham. The [[District attorney|District Attorney]] in charge denied under oath that such evidence existed and the presiding judge at one of Felker's hearings stated that Felker's right to a fair trial had been severely compromised {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.

==Execution==
Despite doubts of his guilt, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] refused to order a new trial or even grant a stay long enough to sort through the mountains of paperwork in the case that had been withheld allowing the defense time to investigate the case further for possible [[exoneration]]. This was because he had been on death row for some time and had not appealed any of the evidence until a death warrant was issued.

Felker was originally scheduled to be executed in May 1996, but a stay was granted and the execution was delayed during the [[Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] and he was eventually executed on November 15, 1996 at the age of 48.

Ellis Wayne Felker was put to death by electrocution in Georgia's electric chair at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center in Jackson, GA. The previous night, when fellow death row inmate [[Larry Grant Lonchar]] was executed for three murders, Felker had requested to be able to videotape Lonchar's execution to prove that the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  The next time an execution would be videotaped would be that of [[Andrew Grant DeYoung]] on July 21, 2011.

==Exoneration attempt==
In 2000, a Georgia judge ruled that DNA testing would be performed in the first-ever attempt by a court to exonerate an executed person in the United States.  The results were ruled as inconclusive; however this finding alone would not have been enough to grant a new trial, or exoneration and release.

'''Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers''' (18 August 1720 &amp;ndash; 5 May 1760) was an English nobleman, notable for being the last [[peerage|peer]] to be [[hanging|hanged]], following his conviction for murdering his steward.

==Biography==
Lord Ferrers, descendant of an ancient and noble family, was the eldest son of the Honourable Laurence Ferrers, himself the third son of the [[Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers|first Earl Ferrers]]. At the age of twenty, he quit his [[Estate (house)|estates]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] education, and began living a debauched life in Paris. At the age of twenty-five he inherited his title from his insane uncle the [[Henry Shirley, 3rd Earl Ferrers|3rd Earl Ferrers]], and with it estates in [[Leicestershire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]]. He lived, however, at [[Staunton Harold Hall]] in northwest Leicestershire. In 1752, he married Mary, the youngest sister of [[Sir William Meredith, 3rd Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earl Ferrers|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ferrers.html|website=capitalpunishmentuk.org|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Meredith|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p28319.htm#i283182|website=ThePeerage.com|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrers was also a cousin to [[Selina, Countess of Huntingdon]], the prominent [[Methodist]] lady and supporter of [[George Whitefield]], though he was not involved in the Methodist revival.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Marriage troubles===
It was said that there was [[insanity]] in his family, and from an early age his behaviour seems to have been eccentric, and his temper violent, though he was quite capable of managing his [[business]] affairs. Significantly, in 1758, his wife obtained a separation from him for [[cruelty]], which would have been rare for the time. She would not accept her husband's drinking and womanizing, and was particularly upset by his illegitimate children. The old family steward, Johnson, may have given evidence on Mary's behalf and was afterwards tasked with collecting rents due to her. She was married again, on 28 March 1769, to [[Lord Frederick Campbell]]. Mary later died in a fire at her country seat, Coomb Bank, [[Kent]], on 25 July 1807.{{sfn|Hamilton|1886|p=195}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

===Murder===
[[File:Earl Ferrers shooting his steward.JPG|left|thumb|150px|18th century illustration of Lord Ferrers shooting his steward, from [[the Newgate Calendar]]]]
The Ferrers' estates were then vested in [[trustee]]s; Ferrers secured the appointment of an old family steward named Johnson, as receiver of rents. This man faithfully performed his duty as a servant to the trustees, and did not prove amenable to Ferrers' personal wishes. On 18 January 1760, Johnson called at the earl's [[mansion]] at [[Staunton Harold]], [[Leicestershire]], by appointment, and was directed to his lordship's study. Here, after some business conversation, Lord Ferrers shot him. Johnson didn't die immediately, but instead was given some treatment at the hall followed by continued verbal abuse from a drunken Ferrers before a Dr. Kirkland was able to convey him to his own home where he died the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earl Ferrers|url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/ferrers.html|website=CapitalPunishmentUK.org|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following April Ferrers was tried for [[murder]] by his [[peerage|peer]]s in [[Westminster Hall]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Charles Pratt]] leading for the prosecution.{{sfn|Thomas|2008}} Shirley's defence, which he conducted in person with great ability, was a plea of insanity, and it was supported by considerable evidence, but he was found guilty. According to [[Horace Walpole|Lord Orford]], &quot;Lord Ferrers was not mad enough to be struck with [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon|Lady Huntingdon's]] sermons. The [[Methodism|Methodists]] have nothing to brag of his conversion, though [[George Whitefield|Whitefield]] prayed for him.&quot; Ferrers subsequently said that he had only pleaded insanity to oblige his family, and that he had himself always been ashamed of such a defence.{{sfn|Asked by the Lord High Steward &quot;why judgement of death should not pass upon you according to law,&quot; he answered &quot;I am extremely sorry that I have troubled your lordships with a defence that I was always much averse to, and has given me the greatest uneasiness; but was prevailed on by my family to attempt it as it was what they themselves were persuaded of the truth of ... .&quot; 19 Howell State Trials 885, 957-58. [A free download from Google Books.] This is a fairly authoritative source and contains a full transcript of the proceedings, including the witnesses. The verdict of guilt was unanimous, including the peers who were judges. The tone of the trial was set by Pratt, known better to history as Lord Camden and later both Lord Chief Justice of Common Pleas and then Lord Chancellor. He opened the case with the calm statement: &quot;My lords, as I never thought it my duty in any case to attempt at eloquence, where a prisoner stood upon trial for his life; much less shall I think myself justified in doing it before your lordships; give me leave therefore to proceed to a narration of the facts.&quot; 19 Howell 895. He then summarized the facts as the witnesses would testify without any emotive coloring and concluded: &quot;If he has any defence, God forbid that he should not have a fair opportunity of making it. Let him be heard with patience. The prosecutors will be as glad as your lordships to find him innocent.&quot; At 902. Anyone who is familiar with U.S. juries would expect most to reach the same verdict on the same evidence.}}

===Execution===
On 5 May 1760, dressed in a light-coloured suit embroidered with silver (the outfit he had worn at his wedding), he was taken in his own [[carriage]] from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] and there hanged by [[Thomas Turlis]].{{sfn|Kaufman-Osborn|2002|p=77}} There are several illustrations of the hanging. It has been said that as a concession to his rank the rope used was of [[silk]]. After the execution his body was taken to Surgeon's Hall for public exhibition and dissection. The execution was widely publicised in popular culture as evidence of equality of the law and the story of a wicked nobleman who was executed &quot;like a common criminal&quot; was told well into the 1800s.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--For everything since the last citation--&gt;

'''Jacques Fesch''' (April 6, 1930, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] – October 1, 1957, [[La Santé Prison]], [[Paris]]) was the [[murder]]er of a [[French National Police|French police officer]], who became such a devout [[Roman Catholic]] while in prison awaiting [[capital punishment|execution]] that he has been proposed for beatification.

==Early life==
Fesch's father was a wealthy banker of [[Belgium|Belgian]] origin, an artist and [[atheist]], distant from his son and who get along with his wife. Jacques was a young dreamer aimlessly in life; brought up a Roman Catholic, he abandoned religion by the age of 17. At 21, he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a [[civil marriage|civil ceremony]]. He gave up a position at his father's bank, lived the life of a playboy, left his wife and their daughter, and fathered an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son with another woman. Disillusioned with his life, he dreamed of escaping to sail around the [[South Pacific Ocean]], but his parents refused to pay for a boat.

==Crime==
On 24 February 1954, to fund the purchase of a boat, he went to rob Alexandre Sylberstein, a [[bureau de change|money changer]], of [[gold coin]]s. Sylberstein was struck but not unconscious, and raised the alarm. Fesch fled, losing his [[eyeglasses|glasses]], and shot wildly at Jean Vergne, a pursuing police officer, killing him. Minutes later he was arrested. Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion, inflamed by newspaper reports, was strongly in favour of his execution. The [[Cour d'assises]] of Paris condemned him to death on 6 April 1957.

== Religious conversion ==
At first Fesch was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer's Catholic faith. However, after a year in prison, he experienced a profound mystical conversion, became very pious, and bitterly regretted his crime. He corresponded regularly with his family, notably his brother and stepmother, and kept a spiritual [[personal journal|journal]]. He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution. His last journal entry was &quot;In five hours, I will see [[Jesus]]!&quot;.  An appeal for [[clemency]] to [[President of France|President]] [[René Coty]] failed, and he was [[guillotine]]d.

==Legacy==
After his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. At first he was excoriated by the public, but with the work of Soeur Véronique, a [[Carmelite]] nun, and Father Augustin-Michel Lemonnier, the family effected publication of his writings, and from the 1970s these served as an inspiration to many.

On September 21, 1987 the [[Archbishop of Paris]], Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]], opened a diocesan inquiry into his life; the cause for his [[beatification]] was formally opened in 1993. This has proved controversial, with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">'''Joseph Filkowski''' ('''''John Blake''''') (died 1931) was a [[Polish-American]] gangster in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

A longtime figure in Cleveland's underworld, Joseph Filkowski led the Polish bootlegging gang, the Flats Mob. In October 1930, he and two other gang members held a police officer captive during the gangs hold up of the Dixie Shoe Company, relieving him of both his gun and uniform. 

Although successfully escaping, the incident resulted in gaining the attention of local law enforcement and, although escaping from a police trap on December 6, Filkowski associate [[Joseph Stazek]] was killed by Cleveland detectives the following day. Two days later, on December 9, a Patrolman Patrick McNeely accidentally shot [[Joseph Fortini]], a district circulation manager of the newspaper ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', who McNeely had mistaken for Filkowski. The Fortini shooting would begin a lengthy, yet ultimately unresolved, inquiry into the use of police firearms. 

The majority of the gang were eventually captured by authorities and sentenced to life imprisonment with the exception of Filkowski, who was sentenced to death. Filkowski's [[death mask]] is on display in the [[Cleveland Police History Museum]].

'''Melbert Ray Ford, Jr.''' (December 9, 1960 – June 9, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] convicted double murderer who in 2010 was executed by lethal injection by the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|U.S. state of Georgia]] after being convicted of murder in 1987.

Ford was born in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|America]]. He was convicted in 1987 of killing his former girlfriend, Martha Chapman Matich, and Lisa Chapman, her 11-year-old niece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.covnews.com/news/article/12534/ |title=Execution rescheduled for Melbert Ray Ford |publisher=Covnews.com |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a March 6, 1986 robbery at Chapman’s Grocery store  in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://off2dr.com/modules/extcal/event.php?event=326 |title=Melbert Ray Ford - Georgia Death Row - Scheduled Execution : Pro Death Penalty Information - Scheduled Executions |publisher=Off2dr.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford had told a friend that he “was going to blow her brains out,” and devised a plan to rob the store, saying he intended to kidnap Matich, take her into the woods, make her beg and then shoot her in the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtvm.com/Global/story.asp?S=12521035 ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
Ford was executed by lethal injection on June 9, 2010.  He was the 24th inmate put to death by [[List of individuals executed in Georgia (U.S. state)|lethal injection in the U.S state of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcor.state.ga.us/GDC/OffenderQuery/jsp/OffQryRedirector.jsp{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously granted a 90-day stay in mid-February because there was a vacancy on the Georgia [[Board of directors|Board]] of Pardons and Paroles. A court had previously held that to go forward with an execution without a full five-member board is a violation of the Georgia Constitution.

Georgia's Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Ford on June 9. which could have stayed his execution on the same day. The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously denied Ford's motion to halt his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/rss/rss_story.aspx?storyid=145044 |title=Melbert Ford Executed Wednesday Night |publisher=11alive.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 9, 2010, Ford was executed by lethal injection.

'''George Forster''' (or '''Foster''') was found guilty of murdering his wife and child by drowning them in [[Paddington Canal]], [[London]]. He was [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Newgate]] on 18 January 1803, shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by [[Italy|Italian]] scientist [[Giovanni Aldini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[The Newgate Calendar]] |url=http://www.exclassics.com/newgate/ng464.htm |title=George Foster Executed at Newgate, 18th of January, 1803, for the Murder of his Wife and Child, by drowning them in the Paddington Canal; with a Curious Account of Galvanic Experiments on his Body |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his trial the events were reconstructed. Forster's mother in law recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see Forster at 4 p.m. on Saturday 4 December 1802. Joseph Bradfield, in whose house Forster lodged, reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at 10 a.m. on the Sunday morning. He also stated that Forster and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him. Various witnesses saw Forster with his wife and child in public houses near Paddington Canal during the day on the Sunday. The body of his child was found on the Monday morning and, after the canal was dragged for three days, his wife's body was also found.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Forster claimed that upon leaving The Mitre he set out alone for [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]] in order to see his other two children who were in the [[workhouse]] there, though he was forced to turn back at [[Whetstone, London|Whetstone]] due to the failing light. This was contradicted by a waiter at the Mitre who said the three left the inn together. Scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to Whetstone in the time he claimed. The jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter. This sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment, but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on [[Judgement Day]], their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded. Forster was hanged on 18 January, shortly before which he made a full confession. He said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

A recent ''[[BBC Knowledge]]'' documentary (''Real Horror: Frankenstein'') questions the fairness of the trial. It notes that friends of George Forster's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter. According to this documentary, Forster attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife. This was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body, should he not have died when hanged. This was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time. The same reference suggests that his 'confession' was obtained under duress. In fact, it alleges that Pass, a [[Beadle]] on Aldini's payroll, fast-tracked the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor.

[[File:A Galvanised Corpse.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a galvanised corpse]]After the execution Forster's body was given to [[Giovanni Aldini]] for experimentation. Aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist [[Luigi Galvani]] and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle's method of stimulating muscles with electric current, known as [[Galvanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/History/early-nineteen.htm |title=Early Nineteenth century electrochemistry |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment he performed on Forster's body was a demonstration of this technique. ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]'' (a record of executions at Newgate) reports that, &quot;On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened. In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt;

Several of those present believed that Forster was being brought back to life (''The Newgate Calendar'' reports that even if this had been so, he would have been re-executed since his sentence was to &quot;hang until he be dead&quot;) and one man, Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons' Company, was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;newgate&quot;/&gt; The hanged man was certainly dead, since his blood had been drained and his [[spinal cord]] severed after the execution.

==Media==
*The [[Galvanism]] experiment performed on George Forster was explored in the [[Science Channel]]'s ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]''.
*George Forster was noted on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] show called, ''Zombies: A Living History''

'''Robert Foulkes''' (baptised 19 March 1633/34-died 31 January 1678/79), was a [[Wales]]-born  [[English people|English]] [[Church of England]] clergyman and [[murderer]].

Although long presumed to have been a native of [[Shropshire]] in England, Foulkes was born and baptised at [[Mallwyd]], Wales, son of namesake Robert Foulkes and is known to have had an older sibling, brother John, with whom he attended [[Shrewsbury School]] in 1648-49.&lt;ref name=klein&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Peter|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|year=2005|publisher=Merlin Unwin Books|pages=27-28|isbn=1-873674-71-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foulkes, sums up [[Anthony Wood|Anthony à Wood]], ‘became a [[servitor]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in Michaelmas term 1651, where he continued more than four [[years]], under the [[tuition]] and [[government]] of [[Presbyterians]] and independents. Afterwards entering into the [[sacred]] function he became a [[preacher]], and at length [[vicar]] of [[Stanton Lacy]] in his own county of [[Shropshire]], and took to him a [[wife]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Athenæ Oxon. ed. Bliss, iii. 1195&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foulkes married on 7 September 1657, at [[St Laurence's Church, Ludlow|Ludlow parish church]], Isabella, daughter of Thomas Colbatch (died 1637), a deceased former rector of the same parish, three years before his induction as vicar at Stanton Lacy on 12 September 1660.&lt;ref name=klein2&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children, born between 1665 and 1673.&lt;ref name=klein3&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Isabella had been brought up in the home of Stanton Lacy's previous vicar, Thomas Atkinson (died 1657)&lt;ref name=klein4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=25,29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other children Atkinson had left a daughter, Ann (born about 1650), with whom Foulkes began a relationship rumoured to be going on as early as 1669.&lt;ref name=klein5&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foulkes, who had been a zealous preacher in the early years of his incumbency, was later reported seen publicly misbehaving with Atkinson and became a heavy drinker at local alehouses. 

There was speculation when Atkinson was sent away from the parish to give birth at [[West Felton]] to an illegitimate baby girl, born in or about May 1674, held to have been sent for fostering by a wet-nurse elsewhere; her [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] was never firmly proved but was allegedly Foulkes's.&lt;ref name=klein8&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=38-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1676, Foulkes was admonished by the [[Bishop of Hereford]], [[Herbert Croft (bishop)|Herbert Croft]], after complaints about the relationship and other misbehaviours were brought before a [[consistory court]] in Ludlow,&lt;ref name=klein6&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=43-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he also reportedly beat his wife and a churchwarden who tried to intervene at his rectory house on the same night, after drinking at a [[bowls|bowling]] match.&lt;ref name=klein7&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=47-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He [[seduced]] the young [[lady]] who resided with him, took a lodging for her in York Buildings in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], and there made away with the [[child]] that was born on 11 December 1678, by stabbing it in the throat with a knife and disposing of the body down a privy emptying into the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref name=klein9&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|pages=100-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Contrary to popular assertion, given in two contemporary pamphlets, the child was not strangled by him.&lt;ref name=klein10&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;)The next [[morning]] he returned to Shropshire. When the body was found 'by a Strange Providence',&lt;ref name=klein11&gt;{{cite book|title=The Temptation and Downfall of the Vicar of Stanton Lacy|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson eventually made a full [[Confession (religion)|confession]].

Foulkes was [[tried]] and [[convicted]] at the [[Old Bailey]] [[Quarter Sessions|sessions]], 16 January 1678–9. After receiving [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] he manifested great [[penitence]], and was visited by several eminent divines, among whom was [[Gilbert Burnet]]. [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], dean of Bangor, who came to him the very evening after his condemnation, managed to obtain for him, through Compton, [[Bishop of London]], a few days' reprieve, which he employed in [[writing]] forty pages of cant, entitled ‘An Alarme for Sinners: containing the [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Prayers]], Letters, and [[Last Words (book)|Last Words]] of Robert Foulkes, … with an Account of his Life. [[Published]] from the Original, Written with his own hand, … and sent by him at his Death to Doctor Lloyd,’ 4to, [[London]], 1679. He speaks of his unfortunate companion with ill-concealed malignity. On the morning of 31 January 1678–9 he was [[executed]] at [[Tyburn]], ‘not with other common [[felons]], but by himself,’ and was buried by night at [[St. Giles-in-the-Fields]].

'''Richard Edwin Fox''' (February 3, 1956 &amp;ndash; February 12, 2003) was executed by the state of [[Ohio]] for the [[kidnapping]] and [[murder]] of an 18-year-old college student whom he lured to her death with the fake promise of a [[job interview]].

A three-judge panel convicted Fox of aggravated murder and kidnapping and sentenced him to death on June 27, 1990. He spent 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days on [[death row]] as his case was appealed through the state and federal court systems.

==The crime==
The crime for which Fox paid with his life was his first criminal conviction, but Fox had been increasingly aggressive toward women in the months before the murder of 18-year-old Leslie Renae Keckler, testimony at his trial revealed. In fact, it was the victim of a previous encounter with Fox who helped police break the case.

On September 14, 1989, Leslie Keckler applied for a waitress job at a [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]] restaurant where Fox worked as a grill cook. As Keckler was filling out her job application, Fox pointed out Keckler to a coworker and said &quot;I'd like to have some of that&quot;, the coworker testified later. Fox gleaned Keckler's telephone number from the application and asked her to meet him for an interview for a restaurant supply sales job. 

On September 26, Keckler went to a local motel where Fox had arranged the job interview. Keckler's boyfriend saw her just before she left and Keckler told him she might be gone for two or three hours. When Keckler did not return that night, her boyfriend and her mother filed a missing persons report with police. Police found the car Keckler had been driving abandoned at a local mall.

Four days later, two boys riding bicycles found Keckler's body in a rural drainage ditch. Keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket. However, a clasp on her brassiere was broken, her belt was unbuckled, two dress buttons were missing, and her pantyhose was torn in the crotch. Aside from a nearby shoe, police found no other evidence at the scene.

==Wounds==
The [[autopsy]] revealed that Keckler had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds. She had been stabbed six times in the back; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs. Her right wrist had a deep [[Defense wound|defensive wound]] gash, and her face had bruises on her left eye, upper lip, and nose consistent with [[blunt force injury]]. The coroner found no signs of sexual assault.

==Previous attack==
When the story of Keckler's murder was publicized, another Bowling Green woman came forward with a nearly similar story. She had applied for work at a restaurant and received an invitation for an interview for a different position from a man referred to as &quot;Jeff Bennett&quot; but who was later positively identified as Fox. He asked her to come to a local motel&amp;mdash;the same one that Keckler was headed&amp;mdash;to discuss the job opportunity.

After meeting Fox, she agreed to accompany him in his car that evening to discuss the job. They drove for a while and then parked. Fox began making suggestive comments and told the woman he thought her dress was too long. She realized that she had been duped and informed Fox that she was not interested in any job. 

In response, Fox asked what the woman would do if someone &quot;pulled a knife&quot; on her and asked her for money, or asked her &quot;to do other things&quot;. At that moment, the woman jumped out of the car as Fox tried to grab her and said &quot;come back&quot; and that he &quot;wasn't finished with [her] yet&quot;.

She made a safe getaway, but did not report the incident to police until after Keckler disappeared. The woman provided police with a sketch of her assailant.

==Investigation==
A check of the employees at the restaurants where the two women applied for jobs revealed an interesting coincidence: Fox was employed at both places. Other [[circumstantial evidence]] made Fox their prime suspect. On October 2, an acquaintance of Fox told police that the composite sketch resembled Richard Fox of Tontogany. Police confirmed that Fox matched the description of &quot;Bennett&quot; and Fox's car also matched the description of &quot;Bennett's&quot; car.

That same day, police secured a [[search warrant]] for Fox's car and found some &quot;suspicious items&quot;. They asked Fox to come to the station to answer a few questions and he voluntarily accompanied them. 

Before Fox was placed under arrest, he admitted that in early May he had worked at a restaurant where his first intended victim had applied for a job, that he met her at the motel, and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length.

==Arrest and admissions==
After his arrest and after being advised of his [[Miranda rights]], Fox admitted he knew Keckler and claimed they had met and spoke at the restaurant where he worked and met again a couple of days later. He described his encounter with Keckler at the motel on September 26 as a date. Later, at the mall, &quot;he saw Leslie and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car&quot;. Fox said that he and Keckler parked, and &quot;things were getting warmed up&quot;. However, &quot;then Leslie did not want to participate&quot;. 

Unwittingly, Keckler triggered something in Fox's psyche as she tried to get away from him. She called him &quot;an asshole&quot; and started to get out of the car. Fox told detectives, &quot;no one calls me an asshole&quot;. Fox grabbed the woman by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in, then he pulled the coat up over her head.

Fox told police he got a knife out of the glove compartment and stabbed Keckler in the back, after which he got a rope out of the trunk &quot;just to make sure she was dead&quot; and strangled her. He took police to a rural location outside Bowling Green where he dumped Keckler's purse and other property.

==Clemency hearing and execution==
At Fox's clemency hearing where the parole board listens to arguments why it should or should not recommend that the governor commute a death sentence, it was revealed that Fox had written a letter apologizing to the Keckler family for his actions:

: &quot;If I could, I would sit down with my victim's family and try and share how sorry I am, how I have changed and how I wish I could change what happened. I am sorry, and I must pay for my actions, if it be with a life in prison or if it be by my life, I will do what is required as I know I must pay for my mistakes!&quot;

Neither that letter nor his teenage daughter's tearful plea not to be made an orphan (her mother had earlier committed suicide) swayed the [[parole]] board. Fox made no statement before he was injected with the deadly chemicals. The execution took a total of 13 minutes from the time the first chemical was started until Fox was declared dead.

[[File:Sidney Harry Fox.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sidney Harry Fox, police mugshot]]
'''Sidney Harry Fox''' (born?-died 8 April 1930) was a [[British people|British]] petty swindler and murderer. He was executed for the murder of his mother in an attempt to obtain money from an insurance policy on her life. His case is unusual in that it is a rare example of a known [[matricide]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

His murder was detected by then recent advances in [[forensic pathology]].

==Early life==
Fox was described as &quot;the son of decent working Norfolk parents&quot;;&lt;ref name = papers&gt;{{cite news |date=19 May 1930 |page=4 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19300519.2.14 |title=Career of Crime: The Murderer Fox |newspaper=[[Evening Post (London)|Evening Post]] |accessdate=2010-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; little is known of his father, although it has been said that he was a railway porter. Fox was in trouble in his teens as a petty thief while in service at good houses, for which he was [[Birching|birched]].&lt;ref name = papers/&gt; Learning from his association with people of quality, he later developed a role as a plausible, genteel con-man until [[World War I]], when he obtained a job in a London bank and proceeded to [[forgery|forge]] cheques on the accounts of his customers. On discovery of his dishonesty in 1916, Britain was then in the middle of the [[Great War]] and needed soldiers. Fox was offered immunity from prosecution on condition that he enlisted in the Army, however he enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]], getting an officer's commission by claiming to be an [[Old Etonian]]. He drew on his banking experience to forge cheques on his brother officers' accounts. He was caught and sent to prison for three months, ending his military career.&lt;ref name = papers/&gt;

==The murder==
Fox and his mother Rosaline lived on 18 shillings per week (£{{Inflation|UK|0.90|1929|2010|r=0}} equivalent in 2010) between them, supplementing this by cashing worthless cheques and moving from town to town. In 1927, Fox was imprisoned for fraud and his mother committed to the [[workhouse]]. On his release, he commenced a bogus affair with a Mrs Morse for mercenary reasons; she knew nothing of his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wilson|1984|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the access given to steal her jewellery, and he also insured her life for £6000 (£{{Inflation|UK|6000|1929|2010|r=0}} in 2010). Mrs Morse awoke one evening to find the gas-tap in her bedroom turned on. The resultant outcry led to a divorce action being filed by Mr. Morse, naming Fox as co-respondent. Fox was arrested on several charges, imprisoned for the jewellery theft and released in March 1929; he and his mother found it convenient to renew their travelling life.

In April 1929 Fox persuaded his mother to make a will in his favour, despite her poverty, and on May 1, insured her life against accidental death, the policy to expire on 23 October. Some months later, they arrived at a hotel in [[Margate]] without any luggage and booked rooms. A week later, on 23 October, Fox and his mother ate dinner, Fox buying a half-bottle of port as a &quot;[[nightcap (beverage)|nightcap]]&quot; for her. At 11.40 pm that evening, Fox raised the alarm that there was a fire in his mother's room, and her partly clad body was pulled out of it by another guest.

Although a doctor certified [[asphyxia|suffocation]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] as the cause of death, and Rosaline Fox was buried in Norfolk a week later, the insurance investigators had examined the room and were suspicious. They believed that a patch of unburnt carpet between Mrs Fox's body and the gas stove supposedly the source of the flames made Fox's story inconsistent. As a result, Mrs Fox's body was exhumed for [[forensic examination]].

[[Sir Bernard Spilsbury]] performed the [[post-mortem]] and deduced that Mrs Fox had been [[strangling|strangled]] to death, due to a bruise on her [[larynx]], and the absence of [[soot]] in her lungs showed that she had been dead before the fire had started. As a result, Fox was arrested and charged with the murder.

==Trial==
Fox was tried at [[Lewes Crown Court|Lewes Assizes]] before [[Mr Justice Rowlett]], with Sir [[Henry Curtis-Bennett]] and [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt|Sir William Jowitt]] (then the [[Attorney-General]]) prosecuting, and [[James Cassels (politician)|J. D. Cassels]] defending. The defence were unable to challenge the evidence given by Spilsbury since the bruise on Mrs Fox's larynx had disappeared due to decomposition by the time their experts had examined it. Jowitt subjected Fox to a ferocious cross-examination, and Fox's excuse that he had closed his mother's door &quot;so that smoke should not spread into the hotel&quot; appeared to be cowardly. The jury therefore convicted Fox and he was hanged at [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Jail]] on 8 April 1930, the [[Home Secretary]] having declined to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 April 1930 |page=9 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19300407.2.62 |title=Margate Matricide: Death Sentence to Stand |newspaper=[[Evening Post (London)|Evening Post]] |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassels later remarked that Fox might have saved himself by answering &quot;I don't know&quot; to Jowitt's question &quot;why did you shut the door?&quot;

==Dramatisations==
Around 1948, the radio series &quot;Secrets of Scotland Yard&quot; dramatised the story under the title &quot;Smoke Clings to the Hair&quot;.

The case was dramatised as &quot;Murder at The Metropole&quot; in 1976 as part of the &quot;Killers&quot; television series; Fox was played by [[Christopher Timothy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1336403/ |title=&quot;Killers&quot; Murder at the Metropole (TV episode 1976) |publisher=IMDb  |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later (1981) version, produced by [[Granada Television]] under the title &quot;Lady Killers: A Boy's Best Friend&quot;, starred [[Tim Brierley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b73656d29 |title=A Boy's Best Friend (1981) |publisher=BFI |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Robert George Henry James 'Flossie’ Forsyth''' was a British criminal who became one of the youngest prisoners to be executed in a British prison in the 20th century. He was just 18 years old when he was hanged at [[HMP Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] Prison by [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]] (assisted by Royston Rickard) on 10 November 1960 for the murder of Allan Edward John Jee on 25 June 1960.

One of his accomplices, 23-year-old Norman James 'Flash' Harris, was executed at [[HMP Pentonville|Pentonville]] Prison on the same morning by [[Robert Leslie Stewart]] (assisted by H. F. Robinson).

==The murder==

Forsyth, a road worker, and Harris, an unemployed driver, were part of a gang which also included Christopher Louis Darby (aged 20, a coalman) and Terence Lutt (aged 17, an unemployed labourer). On the night of 25 June 1960, at about 11.17 p.m., they set upon 23-year-old engineer Allan Jee on a footpath at the bottom of James Street, [[Hounslow]], Middlesex, kicking him unconscious while attempting to relieve him of his money (a ten-shilling note which was all the money Jee had on him was missed) and leaving him bleeding from head injuries. Jee, who had been walking home after an evening with his fiancée, Jacqueline Herbert, was about 20 yards from his home when he was attacked; he had become engaged on the previous day. He suffered a fractured skull during the attack and died from his injuries two days later at the West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, having suffered a cerebral contusion.

A witness, Anthony Cowell, who was standing at the other end of James Street, was able to give police a detailed description of four young men running from the scene of the crime; it was a friend of Forsyth's, Kevin Cullinan, who informed the police on 18 July 1960 that Forsyth had been boasting about his part in the attack. Furthermore, he gave the police the names of three young men - Harris, Darby and Lutt - whom he had seen with Forsyth in a coffee bar on the night of the attack. The four young men were arrested two days later; in the course of the police investigation into the murder, traces of Jee’s blood were found on Forsyth’s ‘winkle-picker’ shoes and trousers.

At the time of the murder, Forsyth was on bail for having assaulted two police officers at Heathrow Airport and had been detained in an Approved School.

==The trial==

It became clear at the subsequent trial at the [[Old Bailey]] that Lutt had been the one to strike the first blow upon Jee but that the kicking had been administered by Forsyth. Only Darby claimed to have used no violence upon Jee; for that reason, the charge against him was reduced to one of non-capital murder.

Pathologist Dr. Donald Teare testified that Jee had been kicked five times in the head by the gang.

Three of the gang - Forsyth, Harris and Lutt - were found guilty of capital murder. Both Forsyth and Harris were sentenced to death by [[Rodger Winn|Mr Justice Winn]] on 26 September 1960 under the [[Homicide Act 1957|1957 Homicide Act]], which defined murder in the course of robbery as a capital crime (although nothing had actually been taken in the course of the assault). As a minor, Lutt was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure (he would serve 10 years), while Darby was found guilty of non-capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Execution==

The appeals of both Forsyth and Harris were dismissed in October 1960. A petition for clemency containing around 3,000 names, including such prominent names as [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|The Earl of Harewood]], [[Gilbert Harding]], [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], was turned down on 8 November 1960. The executions took place two days later, at 9 a. m.. Forsyth was given a ’drop’ of seven feet and two inches.

Forsyth – whose girlfriend Margaret Caitlin (he claimed) was expecting his child in January 1961 - was the last 18-year-old to be hanged in Britain (the last teenager to be executed in Britain - 19-year-old [[Anthony Miller (murderer)|Anthony Miller]] - was hanged in Glasgow just over a month later, on 22 December 1960). Only three other eighteen-year-olds were executed in Britain in the 20th century (Henry Julius Jacoby in 1922, Arthur Bishop in 1925 and German POW Armin Kuhne in 1945); the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933|Children and Young Persons Act of 1933]] fixed the minimum age for a prisoner to be hanged at 18 years.

On the morning of 10 November, 20-year-old Victor Terry, a friend of Forsyth's, heard about the executions on his car radio. One hour later, he shot dead a security guard at a bank in [[Worthing]], West Sussex in the course of a robbery. Terry was to claim at his subsequent trial that he was possessed by the spirit of the American gangster [[Jack Diamond (gangster)|'Legs' Diamond]]. He was found guilty of capital murder and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 25 May 1961, on the same gallows upon which Forsyth had been executed just over six months earlier.

'''Willie Francis''' (January 12, 1929 – May 9, 1947) is best known for surviving a failed execution by [[electric chair|electrocution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;strange_case&quot;/&gt;  He was a black juvenile offender [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] at age 16 by the [[Louisiana|state of Louisiana]] in 1945 for having murdered Andrew Thomas, a Cajun pharmacy owner in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]] who had once employed him. He was 17 when he survived the first attempt to execute him, as the chair malfunctioned. After an appeal of his case taken to the [[US Supreme Court]] failed, he was executed in 1947 at age 18.

== Arrest and trial ==
In 1944 Andrew Thomas, a pharmacist in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]], was shot and killed. His murder remained unsolved for nine months; in August 1945 Willie Francis was detained in Texas due to his proximity to an unrelated crime. Police found that he was carrying Thomas's wallet in his pocket.

Francis initially named several others in connection with the murder, but the police dismissed these claims. A short time later under interrogation, Francis confessed to Thomas's murder, writing, &quot;It was a secret about me and him.&quot;  He had no counsel with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt; The meaning of his statement is still uncertain. Author [[Gilbert King (author)|Gilbert King]], in his book, ''The Execution of Willie Francis'' (2008), alludes to rumors in St. Martinville of sexual abuse of the youth by the pharmacist. Francis later directed the police to where he had disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon. The gun used to kill Thomas was found near the crime scene. It belonged to a deputy sheriff in St. Martinville who had once threatened to kill Thomas. The gun, and the bullets recovered from the crime scene and Thomas' body, disappeared from police evidence just before the trial.

Despite two separate written confessions, Francis pleaded not guilty. During his trial, the court-appointed defense attorneys offered no objections, called no witnesses, and put up no defense.  The validity of Francis' confessions were not questioned by the defense, although he had no counsel at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/18/AR2006071801376.html Gilbert King, &quot;The Two Executions Of Willie Francis&quot;], ''Washington Post'', 19 July 2006, accessed 28 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after the trial began, Francis was quickly convicted of murder and was sentenced to death by twelve jurors and the judge despite his having been underage at 15 at the time of the crime. As Louisiana had [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] nearly all blacks at the turn of the century by its new state constitution, the jury was all-white (only voters could serve).

== Execution attempt, appeal, and second execution ==
On May 3, 1946, Francis survived an attempt at execution by the [[electric chair]]. Witnesses reported hearing the teenager scream from behind the leather hood, &quot;Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe!&quot; as the supposedly lethal surge of electricity was being applied.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0329_0459_ZD.html|title=Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber dissent|author=Justice Harold Burton|accessdate=2009-06-10|authorlink=Harold Hitz Burton}} Justice Burton cited an affidavit by Harold Resweber, witness to the botched execution, which reported Francis' outburst.&lt;/ref&gt; The portable electric chair, known as &quot;[[Gruesome Gertie]],&quot; was found to have been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate from the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] at Angola. The sheriff, E.L. Resweber, was later quoted as saying: &quot;This boy really got a shock when they turned that machine on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dissent&quot;/&gt;

After the botched execution, a young lawyer, Bertrand DeBlanc decided to take Francis' case. He felt it was unjust, and cruel and unusual punishment, as prohibited in the Constitution, to subject him again to the execution process. DeBlanc had been best friends with Thomas and his decision was greeted with dismay by whites in the small Cajun town.  DeBlanc took Francis' case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Francis v. Resweber]]'', 329 U.S. 459 (1947), citing various violations of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendment rights. These included violations of [[equal protection]], [[double jeopardy]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].

The preliminary vote was in Francis' favor. A court clerk mistakenly informed Francis' legal team he had won his appeal. The US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, rejected the appeal. The dissenting opinion asked how many attempted executions were needed before this was deemed cruel and unusual punishment. Behind the scenes, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]], who cast the deciding vote to execute Francis, asked his old college roommate to secretly petition [[Jimmie H. Davis|the Governor of Louisiana]] for a [[commutation of sentence|commutation]], which failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;st_peter_times&quot;/&gt;

Subsequently, Willie Francis was returned to the electric chair on May 9, 1947. He told reporter Elliott Chaze a couple of days before the execution that he was going to meet the Lord with his &quot;Sunday pants and Sunday heart.&quot; He was pronounced dead in the chair at 12:10 pm ([[Central Time Zone (Americas)|CST]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;st_peter_times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Trip To Chair-Willie Francis Dies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rMEKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1k4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2776,3328274&amp;dq=willie+francis|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|author=Elliott Chaze|date=May 10, 1947|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
Willie Francis' short life was the subject of a 2006 documentary, titled ''Willie Francis Must Die Again,'' written and directed by filmmaker [[Allan Durand]]. The film, narrated by actor [[Danny Glover]], chronicles the full story of his case and the unprecedented court battle that followed his failed execution. Produced by regional film director/producer [[Glen Pitre]], the film includes first hand accounts of Francis' original trial, interviews with Sister [[Helen Prejean]], author of ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'', a book about the death penalty, and [[Gilbert King (author)|Gilbert King]], author of ''The Execution of Willie Francis'' (2008); and cultural perspective provided by director Allan Durand.

== In popular media ==
*Ernest Gaines' 1993 novel [[A Lesson Before Dying]], telling the story of a young Black man facing execution in 1940s Louisiana, was partly based on the Willie Francis Case. &lt;ref name=&quot;southern_review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesouthernreview.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TSR_Autumn2005_ErnestGaines.pdf|title=Writing A Lesson Before Dying|date=2005|accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">'''Francisco''' (died 28 April 1876) was the last person who was [[capital punishment in Brazil|executed]] by [[Brazil]]. A black slave, he was hanged for the murder of his masters.

In 1874, Francisco and two other slaves, Prudencio and Vicente, were arrested for having beat to death their masters, João Evangelista de Lima and his wife Josepha Marta de Lima. The crime was committed in [[Pilar, Alagoas]]. Francisco and Prudencio fled to [[Pesqueira, Pernambuco|Pesqueira]]; in a confrontation with police, Prudencio was killed and Francisco was captured. Vicente had fled to [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Marechal Deodoro]], where he was captured.

At Francisco and Vicente's trial, they were both found guilty of the murders. Francisco was sentenced to death by hanging and Vicente was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Both appealed to [[Emperor of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]] for clemency; Francisco's appeal was denied and the emperor did not respond to Vicente's. Vicente later died in prison.

Francisco's execution was carried out in Pilar on 28 April 1876. It was the last executions carried out by Brazil.

Since 2000, an annual re-enactment of Francisco's last hours has been held in Pilar on 28 April. In part, the re-enactment is intended to celebrate the abolition of the death penalty in Brazil.

Frazier and co-defendant [[Jermaine Herron]] were found guilty of the 1997 murder of Betsy Nutt and her 15-year-old son after asking to use her telephone, claiming that their truck had broken down. Herron was executed on 17 May 2006. Frazier maintained his innocence up until his execution.

I am innocent.  I am being punished for a crime I did not commit.  I have professed my innocence for nine years, and I continue to say I am innocent.  Let my people know I love them.  We must continue on.  Do not give up the fight; do not give up hope for a better future.  Because we can make it happen.  I love you, I love my son, and I love my daughter.

'''James D. French''' (ca. 1936 – 10 August 1966) was an [[United States|American]] criminal who was the last person [[execution|executed]] under [[Oklahoma]]'s  [[death penalty]] laws prior to ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', which suspended [[capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment in America]] from 1972 until 1976. He was also the only prisoner executed in the United States that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Staff report.

'''Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; Friery''' (February 1843 or 1844 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1866) was a [[New York City]] criminal and independent gang leader during the 1850s and 1860s. Along with five or six others, he entered the [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|East Houston Street]] [[Western saloon|saloon]] of Henry Lazarus on the morning of January 3, 1865. One of the men, California Jack, offered a wager of $100 challenging anyone in the bar to a fight with one of the gang members. When no one responded to their offer, California Jack offered $10 to any man who could take the owner Henry Lazarus's pistol away from him. Having no pistol on him, Lazarus declined their offer. 

Friery then walked toward Lazarus offering to shake his hand and, when he refused, stabbed the saloon owner in the throat with a [[dirk]], killing him instantly. Arrested soon after, he appeared before Judge Abraham D. Russell at the Court of General Sessions and convicted of first degree murder on February 17, 1865. Sentenced to death, he was executed by [[hanging]] on August 17, 1866 at the age of 22.

&quot;'''A'''&quot; is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] created in 2006 by author [[Sara Shepard]]. It is a character of both ''Pretty Little Liars''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' [[Pretty Little Liars|books]] and [[Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|television series]], and primarily appears as a [[Stalking|stalker]] and the main [[antagonist]] of the stories. &quot;A&quot; is one of the main characters of the stories, appearing anonymously in the majority of the episodes and books.

The villain has already had many portrayals. Its basic occupation is to pursue and threaten the four protagonists of the stories. Thus, many identities have been revealed to be &quot;A&quot;. &quot;A&quot; has a specific and unhealthy way of dealing with the protagonists; it often calls them as &quot;[[Bitch (insult)|bitches]]&quot;, &quot;[[dolls]]&quot; and &quot;[[liars]]&quot;. Its handling and acts of terrorism caused great psychological and emotional damage to the protagonists, even leading them to be hospitalized.

After the revelation of [[Mona Vanderwaal]] as the first &quot;A&quot;, she began receiving visits from someone, known as Red Coat, who offered her a partnership and together they built up the &quot;A-Team&quot;. The team had many members but disbanded after the season three finale and Big A began working with a single ally. The identity of the second &quot;A&quot; and leader of the &quot;A-Team&quot; was revealed to be [[Charlotte DiLaurentis|CeCe Drake]]. Five years later, a new mysterious entity arises and begins using Emojis to communicate but later baptizes themselves as &quot;A.D.&quot;, while the Liars refer to the anonymous figure as Uber A.

== Development ==

=== Characterization ===
&quot;A&quot; makes appearances as a figure with black leather gloves, a black hood, dark pants, and dark shoes. Throughout the seasons, the story focuses on the mystery of &quot;A&quot;. However, &quot;Big A&quot; also sported different disguises, including those of Red Coat and The Black Widow.

Uber A also dressed up as several disguises, including those of a [[gardener]], a [[maid]] and a [[surgeon]]. They later costume themselves with the traditional look.

== Novels storylines ==

=== The first &quot;A&quot; ===
Three years after the disappearance of [[Alison DiLaurentis]], her four friends, [[Aria Montgomery]], [[Spencer Hastings]], [[Emily Fields]], and [[Hanna Marin]], each receive messages from someone calling themselves &quot;A.&quot; The girls had drifted apart over the years, so they had no idea that other people were getting texts as well. Additionally, the texts were about secrets only Ali knew about. At first, the messages were simply teasing and all of the girls wonder if their missing friend was the one who sent them. Though they knew she was most likely dead, she was still the only one who knew their darkest secrets. Once Ali's body is discovered in her old backyard, the girls are even more baffled when they continue to receive threats. At Ali's funeral, the girls are reunited and they find out that they've all been receiving weird messages. As the girls stand outside after the funeral ends, they all get a text saying, &quot;I'm still here, bitches. And I know everything. —A&quot;.

From that point on, the messages take on a distinctly more threatening tone. Aria is given an ultimatum to tell her mother about her father's affair by midnight after the Foxy event, or A will do it for her. A continues to play life-altering games with the girls, from encouraging suspicion of Spencer's involvement in Ali's death to outing Emily's sexuality to her conservative mother. However, A makes a serious mistake in texting Hanna on the night of Mona's birthday party. Instead of using the plain Blackberry she bought just for tormenting the girls, A accidentally uses his/her own phone. Hanna, who has a new phone without all of her contacts recognizes the number, compelling A to act before Hanna can reveal A's true identity to the others. A hits Hanna with an SUV, successfully destroying Hanna's phone and putting her into a coma that eventually leads to a temporary loss of memory. Soon after that, &quot;A&quot; puts a drug in Emily's pain cream which causes an Ulcer in the spot where she has been putting the cream. She ends up in the hospital and might not be able to swim again.

A knew that there was a very good chance Hanna would regain her memory. Hanna's best friend, Mona Vanderwaal, informs the girls that she has also received texts from A, drawing the five closer together in trying to figure out who their tormentor is. Mona subtly encourages Spencer's fears that her sister, Melissa, might be A as well as Ali's killer. During Hanna's recovery masquerade celebration, she suddenly regains her memory, revealing that Mona is A. However, she, Emily, and Aria can't do much about it, because Spencer and Mona are on their way to the police station. After Spencer is warned about Mona by text, she tries to escape Mona's car, but Mona catches on rather quickly and diverts to a path in a more remote area of Rosewood. She tells Spencer everything, from seeing Ali launch a firework into Toby Cavanaugh's treehouse and blind her friend Jenna, to finding Ali's diary of secrets among a pile of old DiLaurentis junk the St. Germains left at the curb, discovering the girls' secrets that only Ali knew. Her motivation was to get revenge for her friend's blindness, even though Jenna and Ali had planned together to launch the firework. Mona didn't know this and got a scar on her stomach from the ordeal. Mona also drops the bombshell that Ian Thomas killed Ali, due to Ali's last diary entry about giving him an ultimatum to break up with Melissa. She then offers Spencer to become A with her and tell Hanna that she must not be remembering correctly, but she refuses. The two fight at Floating Man's Quarry and Spencer accidentally pushes Mona, who falls and has her neck caught between rocks.

=== The second &quot;A&quot; ===
As the girls move into the big red house they are shocked to receive messages from a new person claiming to be &quot;A&quot;. At first, they believe it's just a prank, especially since the first &quot;A&quot; got major news time. Then the girls believe it's Ian Thomas, who is the prime suspect of the investigation. Spencer is especially certain of this until finding Ian's body in the woods bordering her estate and the old DiLaurentis home. The girls all get a message from &quot;A,&quot; saying &quot;He had to go. -A&quot;.

However, this &quot;A&quot; is even more twisted than the first; Ian's body disappears and the town is largely convinced that it was a hoax. &quot;A&quot; even teases Spencer, stating, &quot;Just because I said Ian had to go, it didn't mean he had to die.&quot; &quot;A&quot; pretends to be Ian, using an IM screenname of USCMidfielderRoxx, a testament to his alma mater and his love for field hockey. Through this new fake identity, &quot;A&quot; feeds Spencer some interesting information about her family, specifically her father's affair with Mrs. DiLaurentis and the possibility that Ali is her half sister. &quot;A&quot; proceeds to torment the girls even more: they force Spencer to focus more on her father's secret by enabling Spencer's surrogate mother to scam her and clear out her two million dollar trust fund. &quot;A&quot; taunts Aria with pictures of her and her mother's new love interest in compromising situations. They threaten to send these to her mother, even though Aria has tried to ward off her mother's new boyfriend. &quot;A&quot; lands Hanna in the Preserve at Addison-Stevens, a lush clinic for troubled patients. &quot;A&quot; sends Emily on a trip to the Amish community in Lancaster to dig up more dirt on Officer Wilden.

Throughout the second half of the series, the second &quot;A&quot; keeps up this forced information search with the girls, pushing them to find more information on Wilden and Jason DiLaurentis. &quot;A&quot; even plants the idea that they killed Ali. However, when Jenna is found dead in [[Pretty Little Liars#Heartless|''Heartless'']], &quot;A&quot; plants all of their texts, pictures, etc. on a random lecherous construction worker. This is one of the same workers who was involved in building the DiLaurentises' gazebo when &quot;Ali&quot; was still alive. The girls believe it is all over now, though the fact that the suspect is such a random person bothers them.

Everyone in Rosewood is shocked when the DiLaurentises introduce the existence of a third child, Courtney DiLaurentis. She is the twin of Alison and was kept in various clinics because she was &quot;ill&quot;. However, &quot;Courtney&quot; is actually Alison DiLaurentis herself. She reveals her true identity to each of the girls, hoping to gain their friendship and telling them she never died the night of the sleepover. She claims that Courtney must have gotten out of the house and ran into the construction worker, who killed her. Though the girls believe her and are glad to have their friend back, Aria is the most suspicious of her. It was recently discovered that Courtney liked to pretend to be Ali and she wasn't completely buying her story. Additionally, Wilden and Melissa are also suspicious of &quot;Courtney&quot;. Melissa knew about the twins since high school, as their brother Jason confided in her. He told her they hated each other, but Spencer tells her about &quot;Courtney's&quot; statements that she and Ali shared everything together.&quot;

Ali's time is running out, for besides the few people suspicious of her, the police start to say that the construction worker has an alibi and might not be guilty. Her secret is further endangered when Aria finds and sends in a photo of a reflection of someone spying on the girls during the sleepover. The reflection is too blurry, but it is clearly a female. Ali takes Mona's idea and convinces Spencer that Melissa is the culprit. Meanwhile, she kidnaps Melissa- who has just figured out the truth- and keeps her in her family's Poconos home. She stuffs Melissa in a closet with Ian's corpse.

On the night of the school's Valentine dance, Ali convinces the girls to hang out with her at the Poconos home. They ditch the party and get wasted at her home. She asks them if she could reenact the night of the sleepover and hypnotize them. Everyone reluctantly agrees, and minutes later they wake up to find Ali gone and the door of the room locked. A letter is slid underneath, informing the girls of the horrible truth: The Alison that they had been friends with had been Courtney all along and the real Ali killed her.

Courtney was mentally unsound and wanted to be Ali so badly that she tried to drown her when they were children. One day, when she was home from the mental institute, Courtney stole Ali's ring and imitated her when she saw Spencer and the others sneaking into their backyard. Ali was sent to the new mental institute, the Preserve, in Courtney's place, and was forced to take her sister's messed up life. On the night of the sleepover, she spied on the girls, followed Courtney after her fight with Spencer, and killed her in revenge for taking her perfect life. She hates the girls for ruining her life and tries to kill them too by boarding up the entire home and setting it on fire. The girls, including Melissa, manage to escape, but no one knows whether Ali is alive. It's hinted that she might be, as Emily hears a faint giggle in the distance as she visits Courtney's grave in the evening.

==== The helper ====
By the end of ''Crushed'', the Liars know that the Second &quot;A&quot;, Alison, has had an accomplice the whole time, and that this accomplice is the Third &quot;A&quot;. They believe that Alison did indeed survive the fire in the Poconos house, and thus that the Second and Third &quot;A&quot; are currently operating together to bring them down (and eventually kill them).

The helper is revealed to be Nick Maxwell.

== Television storylines ==

=== Original &quot;A&quot; ===
[[File:Mona Vanderwaal from Pretty Little Liars.png|thumb|right|[[Mona Vanderwaal]] as &quot;A.&quot;]]
'''Original A''' was the first &quot;A&quot; and revealed to be Mona Vanderwaal. Mona began torturing Alison by sending her gifts, threats and soon attacking her while wearing a zombie costume. &quot;A&quot; continued to mess with Ali and her mother Jessica DiLaurentis, whom she believed it to be Spencer Hastings. After Alison's disappearance, &quot;A&quot; went away for a year but after the corpse of Bethany Young (believed to be Alison at the time) was found, she reemerged. &quot;A&quot; began sending the Liars messages about things only Alison knew about them and soon even began messing with their parents. Doctor Anne Sullivan had previously dealt with the person behind the hoodie and when &quot;A&quot; trashed her office she immediately recognized the person. She almost exposes her identity to the Liars but &quot;A&quot; kidnaps her and went as far as to threaten her son's life. But the Liars are still close to figuring it out and during the second half of season two they manage to get a hold of &quot;A's&quot; phone. They hatch a plan to catch her with this and it works. They find out that &quot;A&quot; had a lair at the Lost woods resort and Spencer and Mona (&quot;A's&quot; newest victim) head over there and find a room full of pictures of Alison and the girls along with a sketch of &quot;A's&quot; costume to the ball, The Black Swan. However, Spencer begins to notice other clues and soon realizes &quot;A&quot; is right there with her. She turns around to see Mona in a black hoodie, who reveals herself as &quot;A&quot;. She kidnaps Spencer and gives her an opportunity to join the &quot;A&quot; team but Spencer declines and the two get into a fight, where Mona is pushed off of a cliff. Though Mona survives, she is sent to Radley Sanitarium for medical assistance. While in the psychiatric hospital, Mona takes up a partnership suggested by the then unknown [[Charlotte DiLaurentis|CeCe Drake]] that starts off the second game. After this, Mona became another henchmen in the &quot;A&quot; hierarchy, obeying the orders of CeCe, whom she knew as Red Coat. Mona was kicked off of the A-Team in the season three finale.

=== Big &quot;A&quot; ===
[[File:Charlotte Black Hoodie from Pretty Little Liars.png|thumb|right|[[Charlotte DiLaurentis|CeCe Drake]] as &quot;A&quot;.]]
'''Big A''' was the person who took over the &quot;A&quot; game from Mona Vanderwaal after she was admitted to Radley Sanitarium and revealed to be CeCe Drake. She had visited Mona in Radley and used her to get information about the Liars before taking over the game herself and had used Mona, Toby and Spencer to do her dirty work and sometimes went under the Red Coat disguise. Big A often hid out at a lair situated in Room A at an apartment building at Mayflower Hill and a mobile RV which was stolen but Toby gave it back to &quot;A&quot; in exchange for information about his mother's death. However, the Team was disbanded in the third season finale and CeCe acted on her own with a few minions and an ally, who is Sara Harvey. It is revealed that Charlotte had been hiding out in the basement of the DiLaurentis house and drilled holes through the floor to spy on the family in her Red Coat disguise and shared the identity with Alison. Her disguise as Red Coat was exposed in the fourth season mid finale when Emily was trapped on a saw at Ravenswood and later got into a fight with Aria who discovered her identity and Charlotte later fell off a platform and escaped. In &quot;A is for Answers&quot; the Liars are under attack by &quot;A&quot; who shoots Ezra Fitz on the rooftop. However in the fifth season premiere, the shooter is revealed to be Shana Fring who attempted to kill Alison but was later shoved off a stage by Aria and died from the impact. After all of this, Charlotte fled to France under the Vivian Darkbloom identity to escape custody for Wilden's death but returned. In the series's 100 episode, Charlotte placed a bomb in the Cavanaugh house which detonated, signalling her return to Rosewood. In season five, CeCe breaks into the Vanderwaal home and kidnaps Mona just as she is about to tell the Liars that Alison is &quot;A&quot; and covers up her kidnapping as a homicide. She then brings Mona to the Dollhouse and tortures her and forces her to dress up and act like Alison. Just as the Liars are being brought to jail, she kidnaps them and tortures them inside the Dollhouse. It is revealed then that Charles DiLaurentis is the girl's tormentor. CeCe/Charlotte reveals herself as &quot;A&quot; and tells her story; saying that she is a transgendered Charles DiLaurentis and became 'A' because the Liars were happy that Alison was gone and after telling her story, she attempts suicide by jumping off Radley but is stopped. She is admitted to Welby State and her reign as &quot;A&quot; finally ends and stays in the psychiatric hospital for five years. When she is released, Charlotte is murdered by an unknown assailant and her death causes the birth of &quot;A.D.&quot;

===Uber &quot;A&quot;===
'''Uber A''' is the third major &quot;A&quot; to have tormented the Liars. This antagonist desperately craves vengeance over the tragic passing of Charlotte DiLaurentis, and is trying to seek out the person responsible. Unlike Mona or Charlotte, this villain does not use any nicknames at first but instead signs their messages with [[emojis]], which differentiates them from the A-Team. This causes Caleb to nickname them Amoji. However, in the sixth-season finale, they begin using the alias &quot;A.D.&quot; and kidnap [[Hanna Marin|Hanna]], whom they believe is accountable for their loved one's homicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVLine 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swift|first1=Andy|title=''Pretty Little Liars'' Season Finale Recap: [Spoiler]'s Twin Revealed|url=http://tvline.com/2016/03/15/pretty-little-liars-recap-season-6-finale-mrs-dilaurentis-twin-mary/|website=[[TVLine]]|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna manages to escape Uber A's clutches and they go after Alison, who the Liars suggested as guilty for her own cousin's murder. Uber A eventually finds out that Alison is innocent after searching her jacket. While Uber A does work on their own, they also work through helpers, one of which is [[Jenna Marshall]], though she is not aware of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pretty-little-liars-finale-recap-noel-dead-spencer-shot-mary-drake-mom-1201848353/&lt;/ref&gt;

The team would work under the orders of the &quot;A&quot; in charge, who has been [[Mona Vanderwaal]], the original leader and founder and [[Charlotte DiLaurentis|CeCe Drake]], the second leader. Five years later, Uber A assembles a team of their own.

However, like Mona, he didn't know the identity of Red Coat. Spencer finds out about his betrayal and goes off the deep end, especially after discovering his corpse. However, it is revealed that he is alive and well, with the corpse being a trick by Mona and Red Coat that he says he didn't know about until after. He is also revealed to be a [[double agent]] and gets kicked off the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adangerousgame&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=A dAngerous gAme|series=Pretty Little Liars|series-link=Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Spencer Hastings]] ====
Spencer joined the A-Team near the ending of the third season after having been invited by Mona at the Radley while hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=What Becomes of the Broken Hearted|series=Pretty Little Liars|series-link=Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Spencer was extremely determined to be part of the team. However, she later unfolds the truth behind the disappearance of Toby and became a double agent as well. Likewise Toby, she got kicked off from the team. She is the &quot;A&quot; who kidnapped Malcolm, causing a break up between Ezra and Aria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adangerousgame&quot;/&gt;

==== [[Lucas Gottesman]] ====
Lucas was the personal assistant to Mona. He was blackmailed by Mona and the A-Team into sending texts and doing their dirty work. Lucas claims his blackmail began after Mona discovered he was selling test answers, however Mona later discloses that Lucas was the &quot;A&quot; who gave Emily a massage back in the second season while Mona was off riding with Hanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aisforalive&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title='A' is for A-l-i-v-e|title-link='A' is for A-l-i-v-e|series=Pretty Little Liars|series-link=Pretty Little Liars (TV series)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Melissa Hastings]] ====
Melissa was blackmailed by Mona into wearing the Black Swan disguise to the Masquerade Ball in order to distract Jenna. Mona threatened to reveal her fake pregnancy if she didn't obey her orders. Later, Melissa got onto the Halloween Train dressed as the Queen of Hearts and drugged Aria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aisforalive&quot;/&gt; She and Wilden then attempted to push her off of the train in a box with Garrett's dead body. It is implied that she was once again blackmailed.

==== [[Darren Wilden]] ====
Wilden was also part of the team as he was the Queens of Hearts responsible for trying to kill Spencer. He also murdered Garrett Reynolds fearing he'd expose him as a crooked cop and placed his corpse in a box beside a fainted Aria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aisforalive&quot;/&gt; Wilden's reasoning for helping the team is unknown but implied to be blackmail.

==== [[Jenna Marshall]] ====
Revealed in the seventh-season episode &quot;[[Hit and Run, Run, Run]]&quot;, Jenna is working anonymously for &quot;A.D.&quot; and also with Archer Dunhill in someway. She remains around Rosewood in &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars (season 7)#Episodes|Along Comes Mary]]&quot; and befriends [[Sara Harvey (character)|Sara Harvey]]. Meanwhile, [[Aria Montgomery]] and [[Emily Fields]] discover that Jenna was on Archer's payroll for unknown reasons. On the episode's closing scene, Marshall and Sara are having drinks at The Radley when an unknown figure approaches the two and reveals themselves to be Noel Kahn, who proceeds to join the duo. When confronted by Emily in regards to her involvement with Archer during &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars (season 7)#episodes|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]&quot;, Jenna admits she befriended [[Charlotte DiLaurentis]] after reading about her stay at Welby and reached out. In a flashback, Charlotte enlists Jenna's help to track down the whereabouts of her birth mother and come up with an alias for Archer. The pseudonym &quot;Elliott Rollins&quot; was later created so Archer could deliberately meet Alison and take advantage of her good intentions to benefit Charlotte's eventual release from the psychiatric hospital. In &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars (season 7)#episodes|The DArkest Knight]]&quot; all of the Liars get a text message, ordering them to head over to 1465, Elm Street. After being lured to an abandoned school for blind students, they're held hostage by Noel and Jenna, with Marshall tracking them down at gunpoint. During the cat-and-mouse chase, Jenna takes aim at the Liars only to backfire, until a second gunshot is heard and it injures Spencer. As Marshall prepares to finish her off, [[Mary Drake]] suddenly emerges from behind and knocks her out. While Drake attempts to help Spencer, an unknown figure drags Jenna away from the building. On the closing scene of the episode, the annonymous entity places her in the back of a van, while she questions them if they were responsible for the gunshot that hit Spencer. As the mysterious figure proceeds to rip off an old man's mask and toss it over to Jenna's side, Marshall feels it up and realizes that A.D. was the one who rescued her. In &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars (season 7)#Episodes|Playtime]]&quot;, Jenna is still with Uber A and they give her tea. She thanks them for it and then reminds them of their promise to tell her about the game. A.D. gives Jenna a piece of Braille paper and she reads, saying &quot;Endgame&quot;, as she smiles.

==== [[Noel Kahn]] ====
Revealed in &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars (season 7)#Episodes|Along Comes Mary]]&quot;, Noel Kahn returned to Rosewood to team up with Jenna Marshall and Sara Harvey. Kahn served as one of Charlotte's former minions and worked for her at the Dollhouse, having been responsible for placing blood all over [[Spencer Hastings]] to convince she had hurt someone. Noel became the prime suspect for Uber A, particularly after Alison reveals that he pushed a girl down a flight of stairs when he was drunk during a UPenn frat party. Hanna abducts him at the end of &quot;[[Pretty Little Liars#episodes|The Wrath of Kahn]]&quot; in an attempt to obtain a video confession that proves he's their tormentor. In the following episode &quot;&quot;[[Pretty Little Liars#episodes|The DArkest Knight]]&quot;, she instead ends up slashing his leg with a knife in order to test his DNA and see if it matches Mary Drake's. The results later come back negative and Kahn ends up escaping. Noel and Jenna later lure the Liars to an abandoned school for blind students so they could be held hostage and eventually murdered. During a cat-and-mouse chase, Kahn ends up stumbling upon an axe that decapitates his head after failing to fight Emily and Hanna.

'''Captain &quot;Aarfy&quot; Aardvark''' is a [[fictional character]] in the novel ''[[Catch-22]]'' by [[Joseph Heller]]. Aarfy is the plump [[flight officer|navigator]] in [[Yossarian]]'s [[B-25]], noted for being oblivious to incoming [[flak]], getting lost on missions, and his omnipresent [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]]. His nickname &quot;Aarfy&quot; is an abbreviation of his surname, Aardvark.

==Character sketch==
===Motivation===
Aarfy is a social climber looking to work his way up into high society.

===Goal(s)===
Aarfy befriends [[Nately]] because Nately's father is rich, and he hopes to work for him after the war.

Aarfy sees himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers, looking for any possibility of self-advance within society. &quot;Old Aarfy has never paid for it&quot; he often says in reference to [[prostitute]]s. He often and openly commits [[rape]], and says he can tell which girl is &quot;nice and clean&quot; and which isn't.

===Relationships and conflict(s)===

[[Yossarian]] is constantly infuriated by Aarfy during missions, who appears to have no fear of flak and always gets in Yossarian’s way when he is trying to get back to the escape hatch, away from the bombardier position in the nose.

Aarfy tries to be friends with Nately, in the hope that his father will give Aarfy an important job after the war for this service. Nately realizes that Aarfy is a &quot;climber,&quot; though, and sees the other officers more as his friends.

Aarfy helps to protect women with social connections from the sexual advances of the other officers, much to their dismay, hoping that these connections will later be of use. Unlike the other officers, Aarfy is not willing to pay for sex with a prostitute, but perversely he has no regrets when he rapes and murders the innocent maid Michaela; when asked by Yossarian why he didn't simply hire a prostitute, he repeats his common admonition that &quot;Old Aarfy has never paid for it&quot;, and shows no remorse except when he begins to fear that he may be brought to justice.

===Epiphany===
When Yossarian starts to convince Aarfy that he will have to pay for the rape and murder of Michaela, for the first time in the novel he loses his composure and shows fear.  His fear is not realized though, as when the police arrive, they arrest Yossarian for going [[AWOL]] and not Aarfy. His heinous actions are therefore vindicated and he can be satisfied that the system is there to protect him.

==Biographical summary==
===Actions in &quot;Catch-22&quot;===
====On Mission====
During dangerous missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy to get out of the way so he can get to the escape hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him, infuriating Yossarian even more, and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts, Aarfy never can hear him (except when he says &quot;never mind&quot;). On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy, but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up, leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless.

He nearly gets himself and his comrades killed several times while getting lost on mission:
*Over [[Ferrara]], when Yossarian went round a second time to bomb the bridge and [[Kraft (Catch-22)|Kraft]] and his plane's crew were killed.
*On a [[milk run]] to [[Parma]], where Aarfy led the planes over the city of [[Livorno]] and Yossarian got hit in the leg by [[flak]].
*With [[Colonel Cathcart]], where the plane almost got shot down.

Aarfy is so heedless of his own personal safety and the well-being of others that it always astounds him when they become angry at him.

====Social Climbing====
Aarfy throughout the novel tries to befriend Nately, as a means of getting in favor with his wealthy father:

:&quot;he had already fallen truly in love with Nately's father and the prospect of working for him after the war in some executive capacity as a reward for befriending Nately.&quot;

The irony is that Nately actually sees his friends as Yossarian, [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]], [[Hungry Joe]] and [[Dunbar (Catch-22)|Dunbar]] whom his parents would not be impressed with, but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as a “climber”.

The girls upstairs and the cameo woman – protects them from the sexual advances of the officers, not for his own pleasure, but because he sees them as women connected to important men who could help him out after the war.

====Fraternity Life====
Aarfy views women as purely a means to an end, whether it is for sex or for social connections.  He advises Nately that if he wants to keep [[Nately's Whore|his prostitute]] in the apartment in [[Rome]] one night, then pay for them to stay till after curfew and then they will be obliged to stay and do what ever they want. He gives an example when he has done this before in his fraternity days:

:“I remember one day we tricked two dumb high-school girls from town into the fraternity house and made them put out for all the fellows there who wanted them by threatening to call up their parents and say they were putting out for us. We kept them trapped in bed for more than ten hours. We even smacked their faces a little when they started to complain. Then we took away their nickels and dimes and chewing gum and threw them out.”

====Michaela====
Toward the end of the novel, Aarfy rapes and murders a maid, Michaela, while on leave in Rome. This inadvertently forms the emotional center of the novel. When an aghast Yossarian tells him that he will be arrested and possibly [[Execution (legal)|executed]], Aarfy laughs dismissively that no one would do that to &quot;good old Aarfy&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
:&quot;But I only raped her once!&quot; he explained.
:Yossarian was aghast. &quot;But you killed her, Aarfy! You killed her!&quot;
:&quot;Oh, I had to do that after I had raped her,&quot; Aarfy replied in his most condescending manner. &quot;I couldn't very well let her go around saying bad things about us, could I?&quot;
:&quot;But why did you have to touch her at all, you dumb bastard?&quot; Yossarian shouted. &quot;Why couldn't you get yourself a girl off the street if you wanted one? The city is full of prostitutes.&quot;
:&quot;Oh, no, not me,&quot; Aarfy bragged. &quot;I never paid for it in my life.&quot; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His insouciant view is vindicated when the police arriving on the scene show no interest in Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going [[AWOL]].

==Major themes==
===Catch-22===
Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy during missions is analogous to his frustration with &quot;Catch-22,&quot; whereby no matter how loud he shouts or hard he fights he can not affect Aarfy, who carries on regardless. Similarly one can not fight &quot;Catch-22.&quot;

Aarfy's character exemplifies the perversity of a society and culture governed by Catch-22s that ultimately serve to protect the powerful. Other, more considerate members of the squadron suffer ignominious or horrible fates while he—merely oblivious and inconsiderate for most of the novel—faces no negative consequences even when his self-absorption drives him to murder. In his reactions to flak, and to rape and murder, Aarfy demonstrates complete insanity. Hence he survives and prospers in a completely insane world.

===Attitude towards women===
Unlike the other officers, most notably Yossarian and Hungry Joe, Aarfy does not outwardly show any signs of lust in the novel. He generally sees women as objects of distaste (as in the whores the officers pay for) or as a means for social climbing.  Although he believes that he is showing them due courtesy, he is not actually respecting these women for who they are, but just using them as a means to an end.

== Film ==
In [[Mike Nichols]]' [[Catch-22 (film)|film adaptation of the novel]], Aarfy is played by [[Charles Grodin]].

'''John Abbott''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[United States|American]] [[CBS Daytime]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.  He is the patriarch of the Abbotts, one of the core families that was introduced to the series in 1980. After a brief portrayal by [[Brett Halsey]], the role was portrayed by [[Jerry Douglas (actor)|Jerry Douglas]] until the character's death onscreen on August 18, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soapcentral.com 2006-08-21&quot;&gt;[http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/recaps/2006/060821.php ''The Young and the Restless'' recap (August 21, 2006) - Soapcentral.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/recaps/2006/060814.php#fri&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 1, 2006, Douglas has been reprising his role as a hallucination to various other characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soapcentral.com 2006-09-01&quot;&gt;[http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/recaps/2006/060828.php ''The Young and the Restless'' recap (September 1, 2006) - Soapcentral.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;soapcentral.com&quot;&gt;&lt;http://soapcentral.com/yr/news/2006/0227-douglas.php&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John's children are [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack]], [[Traci Abbott Connolly|Traci]] and [[Billy Abbott]].

==Casting and conception==
The role was originated by [[Brett Halsey]] in 1980 for a year. Then, [[Jerry Douglas (actor)|Jerry Douglas]] took over the role in March 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;soapcentral.com&quot;/&gt; When John died in 2006, Douglas was only out of work for a few months. [[Maria Arena Bell]], the head writer for the series, brought him back as a recurring guest star on September 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/recaps/2006/060828.php#fri&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since John's death, Douglas has portrayed the role of John Abbott's spirit, and he appears to his children and friends in times of great need. In 2008, Douglas portrayed the role of [[Alistair Wallingford]] on the series for three months.

Following Alistair's departure, Douglas still returns on occasion as Jack's inner conscience.

==Storylines==

===1980–99===
In 1980, John Abbott was introduced as the founder of [[Genoa City (fictional city)|Genoa City]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], Jabot Cosmetics. He went to high school with other prominent Genoa City residents including [[Stuart Brooks (The Young and the Restless)|Stuart Brooks]], [[Neil Fenmore]], [[Katherine Chancellor|Katherine Shepherd]], [[Joanna Manning (The Young and the Restless)|Joanna Manning]], Gary Reynolds, his first wife, [[Dina Mergeron]], and a classmate named Suzanne Lynch, whom Ashley was named after. In 1972, Dina left John alone to raise their three children: [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack]] ([[Peter Bergman]]), [[Ashley Abbott|Ashley]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]) and [[Traci Abbott Connolly|Traci Abbott]] ([[Beth Maitland]]). Dina was unfaithful before she left John because Ashley discovered in 1982 that Brent Davis, her mother's former lover, was her biological father. John never discovered that Ashley was not his biological child. The children were mainly raised by the Abbott [[maid]], [[Mamie Johnson (The Young and the Restless)|Mamie Johnson]] (then played by Marguerite Ray). John had a very prominent role in his children's lives, and he helped them grow up to be successful business people. Jack graduated from [[Harvard University]], and along with Ashley, who graduated from [[Colorado State University]], prepared to one day take over their family company. Traci graduated from [[Stanford University]], and she became a best-selling novelist.

John continued to run Jabot, but he often butted heads with Jack over business deals. By the early 1980s, John began dating the much younger [[Jill Foster Abbott|Jill Foster]], but Jack tried to convince his father to stay away from her given her past marriages to [[Phillip Chancellor II]] and Stuart Brooks. Yet, Jack ended up having an affair with Jill, and when John found them she immediately wanted to end their relationship. Even Jack decided to stay away from Jill, who in turn launched a sexual harassment lawsuit where she was awarded $10,000. By 1982, John and Jill finally reunite and marry despite Jack and [[Katherine Chancellor|Katherine's]] pleas against it.

[[Mamie Johnson (The Young and the Restless)|Mamie Johnson]] also tried to keep an eye on Jill, who quickly began another affair with Jack despite his romances with [[Diane Jenkins]] and his marriage to [[Patty Williams]]. Eventually, Katherine obtained pictures of Jill with Jack. Upon seeing the photos, John had a stroke. In 1986, John and Jill divorced, and John fired Jack and threw him out of his house. Jill received 25% of Jabot Cosmetics, a seat on the board of directors, and a cushy executive position with Jabot at $150,000 a year. With this huge settlement, John and Jack hoped that Jill would stay quiet in order to protect Jabot's image.

John replaced Jack at the company with Traci's new husband [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]), formerly an Abbott gardener. After his divorce from Jill, he began seeing [[Joanna Manning (The Young and the Restless)|Joanna Manning]] ([[Susan Seaforth Hayes]]), a high school friend and [[Lauren Fenmore|Lauren Fenmore's]] ([[Tracey E. Bregman]]) mother. He soon moved on with the director of the local [[soup kitchen]], Ellen Winters. John's relationship with Ellen was the first [[Interracial marriage|interracial]] relationship on ''The Young and the Restless''. John put his love life on hold when Ashley disappeared. He found her in a [[mental institution]] in [[New York City|New York]], and she had [[amnesia]]. Thankfully, she quickly recovered, and John brought her back home to Genoa City. Then, Brad quit his job, and John was forced to hire Jack again. John became involved with [[Jessica Blair Grainger]]. Jessica was [[Christine Blair]]'s ([[Lauralee Bell]]) mother, who had recently returned to town. Jessica was diagnosed with [[AIDS]], but she kept her illness a secret from everyone, including John. She tried to move back to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], but she collapsed during her travels. Christine discovered her illness, and she told John. Undeterred, the couple still married in 1988 until Christine's father, Jim Grainger, came to town. John nobly ended the marriage in 1989, and Jessica, John and Christine reunited as family. Jessica died later that year with her loved ones, including John, at her bedside.

Then, Jack decided to take Jabot public, and [[Victor Newman (fictional character)|Victor Newman]] ([[Eric Braeden]]) took over the company. John's shock over this news caused him to have another [[heart attack]]. Jack tried to bring Jabot back by ending his romance with Victor's ex-wife [[Nikki Newman]] and in turn Victor would let the Abbotts to regain control of Jabot. However, Victor had tricked Jack and he remained in control of Jabot. Out of spite, Jack married Nikki. Victor had also managed a short time afterwards to have a romance with John's ex-wife Jill.

Then, Jill and John reunited when she was rejected by Victor Newman. They remarried in 1993, and Jill wanted to have a baby. Still, John complained that he was too old to be a father. She managed to get pregnant before John had a secret [[vasectomy]]. John wanted Jill to have an [[abortion]], but she refused. Thus, [[Billy Abbott|William Foster Abbott]] was born in 1993. John thought that Victor might be Billy's father, but when he found out that Billy was his biological son, he grew to love him. Then, Jill had an affair with Jed Sanders due to John's [[impotence]]. As Jill and John separated, John's first wife, Dina, returned to Genoa City and John began romancing her again. John eventually proposed, and filed a divorce from Jill. Stress from the divorce and the custody battle over Billy gave John a stroke, but he quickly recovered. Dina left Genoa City again much to John, Jack, Ashley, and Traci's surprise. John eventually won custody of Billy and moved to New York where Billy attended [[boarding school]]. Jack and Ashley ran Jabot while their father was raising Billy. John returned to Genoa City with a 16-year-old Billy in 1999. He returned to help Jack and Ashley fight to maintain control of Jabot.

===1999–2006===
While in town, John began dating his old friend, [[Gina Roma]] ([[Patty Weaver]]), and he occasionally sang with her at her restaurant, ''Gina's''. Billy graduated high school, and he went to [[Louisiana]] for volunteer work. Meanwhile, Traci's daughter, [[Colleen Carlton]] (then played by [[Lyndsy Fonseca]]), was placed into John's guardianship when she was expelled from school for smoking [[marijuana]] in 2001. Colleen began dating [[J.T. Hellstrom]] ([[Thad Luckinbill]]), but John forbade his granddaughter from seeing J.T., who was much older than she was. Colleen soon began living with her father, Brad Carlton. In 2003, Ashley and Brad were married and expecting a child, but Ashley got into a horrific car accident, and their son, Robert, did not survive. Meanwhile, Gina's restaurant, ''Gina's'', caught on fire, and John watched out for her until she found new employment. Then, John and Ashley scolded Jack for the troubles he brought upon the company. Victor ended up paying Jabot $75 million for his commercial bribery scandal, and Jack was forced to resign.

In 2004, John was lovestruck by the much younger [[Gloria Fisher]] ([[Judith Chapman]]). He was unaware that her sons were [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]) and [[Kevin Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Kevin Fisher]] ([[Greg Rikaart]]). Kevin had almost murdered Colleen, and he set ''Gina's'' on fire. John and Gloria went on a cruise, and they came back as Mr. and Mrs. John Abbott. Ashley and Jack were shocked by their father's latest romance; Jack accepted Gloria if his father was happy, but Ashley refused to accept her new stepmother. Then, John found out about Gloria's sons, and he vowed to divorce her for deceiving him. Suddenly, he fell down a flight of stairs, and he was forced to have hip replacement surgery. Gloria nursed him back to health, and he forgave her for her deceit. Ashley became the CEO of Jabot, but John fired her when she began working with her on-and-off lover, Victor Newman. John came out of retirement, and he resumed his position as CEO of Jabot until he could find a proper replacement. He settled on making Jill Abbott the new CEO.

In 2004, Ashley was pursued by a mysterious man, [[Tom Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Tom Callahan]] ([[Roscoe Born]]). In reality, Tom was Gloria's estranged husband, Tom Fisher, who she never officially divorced. Tom was Kevin's biological father; he was known as &quot;Terrible Tom&quot; because he abused Kevin as a child. Tom eventually cornered Gloria, hoping she would give him money now that she was married to a wealthy Abbott. She tricked John into giving her large sums of money that he thought was being used for Michael's wedding. Michael wanted to tell John the truth, but Tom confessed to him first. In the end, Gloria went along with Tom's lie in order to stay in John's good graces. She continued taking money from John because Tom was blackmailing her. Gloria told John that Tom was dead, but their divorce was never finalized. John forgave Gloria for lying to him, and they &quot;officially&quot; remarried in 2005. Tom wreaked havoc on Michael and Lauren Fenmore's wedding day, and he took Lauren hostage. Gloria was going to meet Tom in order to free Lauren, but John overheard her phone call. He met Tom in an alley, and during their struggle, his gun went off, and Tom was killed. John drove away, and he got into a car accident. At first, he had no recollection of his night, and Ashley confessed to killing Tom. When he remembered, John confessed to killing Tom, and the charges against Ashley were dropped. John was sentenced to seven years in prison for the murder. While John was in prison, Gloria and her sons schemed against the Abbotts. They landed themselves jobs at Jabot, and they sabotaged Ashley and Jack's business plans.

Then, John began fighting with his inmates, and he believed that his first wife, Dina, had just left him. A doctor examined him, and Jack, Ashley and Gloria found out that John was being over-medicated. Jack wanted to trick his father into changing his will to remove Gloria. He made John believe that he was cutting Dina out of the will. Six months after his incarceration, John was due to be pardoned by the Governor. Before his release, he had a stroke, and he was left in a vegetative state. John signed a DNR, and Gloria and her stepchildren agreed that they wanted to abide by John's wishes. John's family and friends came to the hospital to say good-bye, and John died in 2006. Jack and Ashley overruled Gloria's wish to have a lavish funeral. Instead, they told her the wrong time for the ceremony, and they held a small family-only memorial for John. Then, Kevin discovered that his mother was tricked, and he held another service for John with his mother. After his death, the Abbotts were appalled to discover that Gloria was left 50% of John's billion-dollar estate. The remaining 50% was to be divided among John's four children. While Gloria was expecting a big payout, she was stunned when a prison chaplain arrived in court, and he handed the judge a handwritten note by John that wrote Gloria out of his will. In addition, news broke that Gloria's marriage to John was invalid because she never officially divorced Tom. Gloria returned &quot;home&quot; to the Abbott Mansion to find her belongings in trash bags outside while Jack looked on smugly from behind the door. In 2007, the judge made it official that Gloria was not included in John's final will.

===Afterlife appearances===
John has occasionally appeared as a viewable representation of Jack's conscience. He has often berated Jack for his shabby treatment of Gloria and his unethical behavior, but always reminds him of how much he loves him. While John's spirit has occasionally manifested in ways that could indicate a supernatural origin, he has never known about Gloria's various misdeeds until Jack found out about them. Thus, the &quot;spirit&quot; is nothing more than a figment of Jack's imagination, appearing as his conscience, rather than a supernatural presence. Ashley, Billy and Katherine Chancellor have had similar visits from John's &quot;spirit.&quot;

On December 24, 2013, Jack looks at photos of Phyllis, who is now in a coma. John appears. He tells Jack he needs to be with someone who can take care of him - Phyllis wouldn't want to see him home alone talking to a ghost. Jack tells him he's right, but first he has to do something. He calls Phyllis to chat to her. This is the last appearance of John until the episode aired on March 24, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14676">'''Simon Adebisi''' is a fictional character played by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] on the [[HBO]] dramatic series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. Adebisi serves as one of the main characters in the first four seasons. After the first half of season four, his character was [[killed off]] the show so Akinnuoye-Agbaje could film the movie ''[[The Mummy Returns]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/21/oz.end/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Adebisi is one of the most feared and powerful inmates in Oz. A notorious drug dealer, killer, and rapist, Adebisi is feared by inmates and guards alike until his death in the midseason finale of season 4.

==Character overview==
''Prisoner #93A234. Convicted May 2, 1993 - Murder in the first degree. Sentence: Life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.''

Simon Adebisi is serving a [[life sentence]] without [[parole]] for beheading an undercover cop with a machete. An extremely muscular man, he can physically intimidate many of his fellow inmates. As one of the leaders of the Homeboys (The Black Gang in Oz), Adebisi is considered one of the prison's most dangerous inmates, and becomes one of the most recognizable characters on the show. He is well known for his trademark tilted hat, which Akinnuoye-Agbaje suggested was inspired by the &quot;[[Area boys|Area Boys]]&quot; of Lagos, Nigeria.

Adebisi is Nigerian - specifically [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] - and speaks with a strong accent, but had been in America for about 15 years prior to his incarceration.  Adebisi is shown to be short-tempered, hedonistic as well as capable of engineering and executing long-term plans through intellect and manipulation.

==History==

===Season 1===
Adebisi began as a minor character; a lieutenant of [[Jefferson Keane]]. Following Keane's execution in Episode 4, [[Paul Markstrom]] takes over the Homeboys until Adebisi and [[Kenny Wangler]] kill him when it is discovered he is an undercover cop. Adebisi then takes over and partners in the drug trade with the Italians. Italian Mafia boss [[Nino Schibetta]] saw him as the best drug player among the black inmates and respected his leadership skills. Unbeknownst to Schibetta, Adebisi and [[Ryan O'Reily]] intend to take over the drug trade and began putting crushed glass into Schibetta's food to slowly kill him. Adebisi also intimidates his new cellmate [[Tobias Beecher]] with fear of a future rape. Beecher accepts an offer of help from seemingly helpful [[Vernon Schillinger]] and moves out of Adebisi's cell and into Schillinger's cell. Adebisi intimidates Beecher as he leaves but backs off when Schillinger comes to Beecher's defense. Adebisi laughs realizing that Beecher is unaware that Schillinger is the leader of the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryans]] and plans on making Beecher his sex slave. In the Season 1 finale, Adebisi, along with O'Reily, [[Kareem Said]], [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]] and [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]], is a leader of a riot in their prison unit (known as &quot;Emerald City&quot;). He is taken prisoner by the other inmates, however, when he is incapacitated due to [[heroin]] withdrawal. In that episode, it is revealed that Adebisi's crime  was exploited to have swept the previous governor out of office and gave [[Governor James Devlin]] his opening to reinstate the [[death penalty]].

===Season 2===
Adebisi continues to suffer severe heroin withdrawal in solitary during the post-riot lockdown. However, he is able to maintain control of the Homeboys when Emerald City reopens. Nino Schibetta's son [[Peter Schibetta|Peter]] comes to Oz and learns that Adebisi is responsible for the death of his father, and is himself poisoned by Adebisi. Schibetta swears revenge and tries to kill Adebisi with help from [[Chucky Pancamo]]. In the prison kitchen Adebisi beats up Peter and Pancamo. After knocking out Pancamo, Adebisi brutally rapes a semi-conscious Schibetta. As a result, Schibetta is traumatized and humiliated, telling the authorities he doesn't remember what happened to him. In denial about being raped, Schibetta psychologically and emotionally deteriorates. Subsequently, he is transferred to the Oz prison psych ward.

However, two distractions hold Adebisi's attention: first, his crush on [[death row]] inmate [[Shirley Bellinger]], who flirts with him through notes before rejecting him upon discovering that he is black. Secondly, his heroin addiction is out of control. The Italian Mob, seeking revenge for Schibetta's rape, takes advantage of this when new inmate and Mafia boss [[Antonio Nappa]] gets Adebisi put into drug rehab through his staff connections. Adebisi is deposed as the head of the Homeboys and cut out of the drug trade through the help of Nappa's former friends. Another Nigerian Yoruba prisoner, an elderly man named [[Kipekemie Jara]], comes to Oz, and begins to rehabilitate Adebisi, but at the same time the stress of the change brings on [[schizophrenic]] visions and severe [[psychosis]]. The Italians and the blacks consider Jara a threat, so they kill him. The shock and trauma of the event triggers a [[nervous breakdown]] in Adebisi and he is moved to the psych ward, placed in a cell right next to Peter Schibetta.

===Season 3===
Adebisi comes out of the psych ward pretending to be a changed man. To prove he is sane, he defends Peter Schibetta from an attacker in the psych ward. This convinces Antonio Nappa that a potential change in heart from Adebisi could prove useful for the Italian mobsters. This is all a ploy, however, as Adebisi takes a job in the [[AIDS]] ward as a means of obtaining blood from AIDS patient [[Robbie Gerth]] to prick Nappa undetected with an [[HIV]]-infected needle. When Dr. Nathan confirms that Nappa is HIV-positive, he is sent to the AIDS ward, and Pancamo assumes leadership of the Italians. From here Adebisi gets ready to take control of the Homeboys once again.

Meanwhile, [[Kenny Wangler]] is leading the Homeboys, who no longer trust Adebisi. Adebisi approaches Pancamo about becoming partners in the drug trade. Pancamo initially refuses because he is still angered about the beating Adebisi gave him and Schibetta. However, when Adebisi points out that he could be a strong ally, Pancamo agrees to work with him as long as he gets rid of Wangler. Adebisi then shows his sincerity with a plot to depose current black gang member Wangler by burning the skin of Wangler's allies, [[Arnold &quot;Poet&quot; Jackson|Poet]] and [[Junior Pierce]], while Wangler is away at a funeral. When Wangler arrives back in Oz, he is locked in as Adebisi's cellmate. Adebisi practices various African &quot;warrior training&quot; activities such as hog tying Wangler naked. Adebisi then forces Wangler to accuse Unit Manager [[Tim McManus]] of [[sexual harassment]]. The claim hurt McManus, as he is already facing a sexual harassment suit from [[Claire Howell]], putting McManus's credibility at further risk.

Adebisi begins to formulate a plan to take over Emerald City and make it &quot;all black.&quot; The first step is to convince the impressionable Correctional Officer [[Clayton Hughes]] to help his [[African American]] counterparts behind bars as opposed to keeping them locked in. Adebisi tells him that his father had also died in Oz and then convinces Hughes that a white inmate murdered his father. Hughes, after seeing a few white officers make racist statements, starts accusing other black staff members, including [[Warden Leo Glynn]], of betraying their own people and working for an oppressive white-run system. Adebisi's second step involved rallying the Black inmates as a means of taking over the prison. He engineers a plan which results in the prison guards throwing [[Augustus Hill]] in the hole. He exploits the perceived racism of the white officers in order to incense the black inmates to riot. Despite opposition from [[Muslim]] inmate [[Kareem Said]], the black inmates led by Adebisi begin shouting &quot;Set Hill Free&quot; and start physically confronting both the White inmates and correctional officers. Fearing a riot, Glynn locks Oz down into the new millennium and fires Hughes for being sympathetic to Adebisi's cause. Hughes however leaves Adebisi with a gun on his last day of work.

===Season 4===
After the lockdown, Adebisi creates a tense situation by holding the smuggled gun in his cell. He manipulates Warden Glynn to let Poet, Pierce, and Wangler back into Em City claiming that the racial situation will rest easier getting them back. When Wangler asks why Adebisi isn't using the gun, he claims that their goal to get a black man to run Emerald City will be accomplished better if another inmate uses the gun. Adebisi then notices that the three of them led by Wangler harass and bully a new white inmate, a Frenchman named [[Guillaume Tarrant]], who is a solitary loner unfit to handle the stress of prison life. Intending to eliminate Wangler, Adebisi leaves the gun under Tarrant's mattress. The next time Wangler tries to bully Tarrant, Tarrant pulls the gun and kills him, his friend [[Junior Pierce]], Lou Rath, and officer [[Joseph Howard (Oz)|Joseph Howard]] before turning the weapon on himself. With four blacks including one correctional officer dead at the hands of a white inmate, Adebisi's goals are accomplished and his plan is set in motion as Glynn fires McManus for overlooking the gun smuggling incident. [[Raoul &quot;El Cid&quot; Hernandez|Raoul Hernandez]] informs on him, convinced that the Latinos will move to aid the Whites. Hernandez tells Glynn that Adebisi used the gun to stir up racial tension and that it was given to him by Hughes. Adebisi and Pancamo agree that it is time for Hernandez to die, and use new inmate [[Enrique Morales]] to kill Hernandez and take his position as El Norte's gang leader. Meanwhile, a new inmate named [[Desmond Mobay]], who is supposedly [[Jamaica]]n, wants in with the gangsters. Mobay is actually a narcotics detective named [[Johnny Basil]] who is sent in to bust the drug trade in Emerald City. Adebisi is suspicious and opposes having Mobay join as a member their crew. But Mobay comes though and passes every initiation test successfully, eventually gaining their confidence.

Over the course of the season Adebisi, with the help of [[Zahir Arif]], persuades outside community leaders to pressure Glynn into hiring a black man to replace McManus. Glynn is running for Lieutenant Governor, and sees that hiring a black man to run Emerald City is likely to gain him more support from African American voters. Eventually, Glynn does hire a black man named [[Martin Querns]]. Querns, himself an ex-drug dealer, is told to rid Emerald City of violence and racial tension. Querns tells the inmates that they sell and use drugs freely as long as there is no violence. Head guard [[Sean Murphy (Oz)|Sean Murphy]], an ardent supporter of McManus, is appalled by Querns' system, especially because it makes Adebisi, Pancamo, and Morales the trustees. Murphy questions Querns' motive in transferring all of the [[Aryan Brotherhood|Aryan]] and Biker inmates out of Emerald City. Querns fires Murphy and instates a black officer [[Travis Smith (Oz)|Travis Smith]] as the head of Emerald City. Querns later recommends that Glynn transfer out all of the guards loyal to Sean Murphy also. Glynn allows Querns to transfer all of the white guards with the exception of [[Claire Howell]], who hates McManus. All of the new guards transferred into Emerald City are black, as are all of the new inmates. However, none of these inmates are Muslim. This angers Arif, who had helped Adebisi get a black man to run Emerald City in the first place. The new inmates are also all loyal to Adebisi, who becomes the most powerful and influential inmate in the prison, and is given free rein by Querns as long as he suppresses violent incidents. Adebisi now has the freedom to satisfy all his vices, installing a curtain in his cell and creating his own version of &quot;paradise&quot;, although he could not escape the fact that he was still in prison. In time, the [[Christian]] and gay gangs, both predominantly white, are replaced by black inmates, and soon the Italian and Latino inmates are deprived of the drug trade. When these two groups are sent to Unit B, two of Adebisi's lieutenants, Poet and [[Supreme Allah]], are named trustees to replace Pancamo and Morales.

At the same time, two of the few white inmates left in Emerald City, [[Chris Keller]] and [[Ryan O'Reily]], decide to work together to bring Adebisi and Querns down. Keller murders inmates Nate Shemin and Mondo Browne, and they frame Supreme Allah. This causes Glynn to begin to mistrust Querns, who in turn begins to mistrust Adebisi, who tries to force a confession out of his lieutenant and various others. Adebisi is rattled by these events and begins to distrust his own men.

Said, the re-instated leader of the Muslims, is greatly concerned about the effects of Adebisi's leadership in Emerald City under Querns. Said believes that Emerald City is rapidly becoming an inferno in which black inmates are being mentally poisoned. Noting Adebisi's distrust of his men in light of the murders, Said pretends to join forces with Adebisi with the covert intention of bringing him down. Said learns of Adebisi's video recordings of drug parties in his cell, and resolves to find a way to supply Glynn with this damning evidence of Querns' misconduct.

Adebisi accepts Said's request to move into his cell and voluntarily gives him a video tape to &quot;test his loyalty.&quot; However, Said gives the tape to the warden and Querns is immediately fired. When McManus is reinstated as unit manager of Emerald City, he announces Adebisi's transfer out of the prison unit. In retaliation Adebisi tries to kill Said, gaining the attention of McManus, the guards and the prisoners. A large bloodstain splatters on Said's white curtains and Adebisi emerges from Said's cell, seemingly victorious and unscathed. However, he reveals his injuries by spitting out blood from his mouth and falls to the ground, dead. His death was later ruled as self-defense since Adebisi attempted to murder Said first.

'''Akuma''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for &quot;Devil&quot; or &quot;Demon&quot;), known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''Gouki'''|豪鬼|Gōki|lit. &quot;Great Demon&quot; or &quot;Great Ogre&quot;}}, is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s by [[Capcom]]. Akuma made his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' as a [[Player character|secret character]] and hidden [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]. In the storyline of the ''Street Fighter'' video games, he is the younger brother of [[Gouken]], [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]'s and [[Ken Masters|Ken]]'s master. In some games he also has an enhanced version named '''Shin Akuma''', or {{Nihongo|'''Shin Gouki'''|真・豪鬼|Shin Gōki|the &quot;true Great Demon&quot;}} in Japanese. Since his debut, Akuma has appeared in several subsequent titles and has been well received by both fans and critics.

==Appearances==
===''Street Fighter'' series===
Akuma made his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'', the fifth arcade iteration of the ''Street Fighter II'' games, where he appears as a hidden and unnamed character. After meeting certain requirements, Akuma appears prior to the player's final match with [[M. Bison]] and obliterates M. Bison before challenging the player. In the Japanese arcade version of the game, Akuma would introduce himself to the player before the match, proclaiming himself to be {{nihongo|the &quot;Master of the Fist&quot;|拳を極めし者|Ken o Kiwameshi Mono}}. He also has two endings in the game as well: one for defeating M. Bison, and another against himself. While these endings were omitted from the international releases of the arcade game, they were edited into one ending and included in the English localization of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo|Super Turbo Revival]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Shin Akuma is, however, an unlockable playable character in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival'', as well as the Japan-only [[Dreamcast]] version of the game, ''Super Street Fighter II X for Matchmaking Service''. In the latter version, another version of Akuma referred to as ''Tien Gouki'' can also be selected.

Akuma appears in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha|Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams]]'',  where he was given his name, once again as a hidden opponent and unlockable character. His backstory remains the same as in ''Super Turbo''. Akuma was added to the immediate roster in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'' and ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', with a powered-up version of the character named &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; appearing as a hidden opponent. The character's relation with other ''Street Fighter'' characters begins to be fleshed out, establishing rivalries with [[Guy (Final Fight)|Guy]], [[List of Street Fighter characters#Adon|Adon]], [[Gen (Street Fighter)|Gen]] and Ryu. Shin Akuma, rather than &quot;Final Bison&quot;, is Evil Ryu's final boss in the console versions of ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]''.

Akuma and Shin Akuma are featured in ''[[Street Fighter EX]]'' as hidden boss characters, where he is one of the few characters able to move out of the 2D playing field, during his teleport. Akuma also appears in the arcade and home video game console adaption of ''[[Street Fighter: The Movie (arcade game)|Street Fighter: The Movie]]'' despite not appearing in the movie.

Akuma is featured in the ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' sub-series beginning with ''[[Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact|Street Fighter III 2nd Impact: Giant Attack]]''. Like in his debut in ''Super Turbo'', Akuma is both a secret opponent who serves as an alternate final boss and unlockable character, with the CPU-controlled version being the &quot;Shin Akuma&quot; incarnation introduced in ''Alpha 2''. He is a regular character in ''[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike|Street Fighter III 3rd Strike: Fight for the Future]]''. Akuma reappears in ''[[Street Fighter IV]]'', once again as a hidden boss in the Single Player Mode as well as an unlockable secret character in both the arcade and home console versions. Shin Akuma also returns as a hidden boss in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]''.

{{anchor|Oni}}Both secret boss and playable versions of a new form of Akuma, known as {{nihongo|Oni|狂オシキ鬼|Kuruoshiki Oni, lit. The Mad Demon}}, were confirmed in [[Super Street Fighter IV#Arcade Edition|''Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition'']] by leaked videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shoryuken.com/content/clear-video-ultras-oni-evil-ryu-super-street-fighter-4-3262/ Shoryuken: Clear Video and Ultras of Oni and Evil Ryu in Super Street Fighter 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226215318/http://shoryuken.com/content/clear-video-ultras-oni-evil-ryu-super-street-fighter-4-3262/ |date=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Shin Akuma, Oni is the being that would consume Akuma after mastering the Satsui no Hadou.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Akuma returns in ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' as a downloadable character.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

====Oni====

[[Image:Oni (SSFIVAE).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Oni in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition]]'']]

{{Nihongo|'''Oni'''|鬼|Oni|&quot;Demon&quot;}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''Kuruoshiki Oni'''|狂オシキ鬼|Kuruoshiki Oni|&quot;Mad Demon&quot;}} is a character who makes his debut in ''[[Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition]]'' as a secret boss and a playable character. Oni is in fact Akuma, who has become one with the Satsui no Hado entirely.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Oni appears as a far more muscular and noticeably larger version of Akuma. He has dark blue skin, glowing yellow-red eyes and glowing, spiky shoulder-length hair, akin to the Super Saiyan of the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series. He also gains fangs and short protrusions on his forehead, resembling growing horns. The top half of his gi has been blown off by the amount of dark ki he emanates, showing off his musculature; the prayer beads that were once around his neck now float about disconnected around his body. He also has claws on his fingers and toes, and no longer wears sandals; his voice also sounds much more demonic. When using fierce attacks or powerful physical attacks of any kind, his arms and legs glow a superheated color. While it is difficult to spot, the kanji of &quot;heaven&quot; (天 ten) also appears on his back during the same animations, seemingly having branded itself on his back. Oni's moveset is similar to Akuma's but with additional moves and modifications. Oni can perform a fireball that disappears unless charged. To replace the Shankunetsu Hadouken, Oni has an electrical variant. His standing fierce punch cancels out fireballs. Added to Oni is a dashing spinning punch which can vary depending on what kick button is pressed. While jumping, Oni can do an evasive dash backward or forward or even perform a downward attack.  He also uses an overhead smash attack. Oni's gameplay consists of high-damage combos and reversal potential, combined with his above-average walk speed, that allows players to create massive-pressure situations while remaining mobile and flexible via buffering moves into other attacks, although he has below-average stamina, stun and short-range Focus Attack. Oni appears in the second half of the second DLC Lost Episode '''The Strongest vs. The Angriest''' of the video game ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'', given the epithet of &quot;Destroyer of Heaven&quot;. A Pandora version of Oni appears in Akuma's ending in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. He also appears as a playable character in strategic RPG ''Blood Brothers 2''.

====Character design and gameplay====
Akuma has dark red hair, dark skin tone, glowing red eyes with black [[sclera]], wears [[prayer beads]] around his neck, a dark gray [[karate gi]] and a piece of twine around his waist in lieu of an [[obi (sash)|obi]]. The [[kanji]] &quot;ten&quot; ([[天]]) — meaning &quot;Heaven&quot; — can be seen on his back when it appears during certain win animations. Shin Akuma's appearance is very similar to Akuma's; for example, in the ''Street Fighter Alpha'' series, Shin Akuma had a purple karate gi instead of a dark gray one and marginally darker skin tone. Akuma's introduction in ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' stemmed from the development team's desire to introduce a &quot;mysterious and really powerful&quot; character, with his status as a hidden character within the game resulting from later discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Staff |year=1996 |title=A Fighter Speaks |journal=Game On! |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6 |publisher=Horibuchi, Seiji}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked regarding the presence of Akuma as a secret character in several of Capcom's fighting games, [[Capcom]]'s Noritaka Funamizu stated that, while he did not personally support the concept, he said, &quot;Akuma is a character that can fit in any game design nicely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Game Informer |issue=70 |date=February 1999 |title=An Interview with Noritaka Funamizu |page=11  |author =Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Edwards of Capcom Europe considered Akuma the most powerful ''Street Fighter'' character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/nov/19/most-powerful-street-fighter-can-only-be-matched-ingrid-fighting-evolution-capcom-shares-top-5-strongest-characters-franchise/|title=The most powerful Street Fighter can only be matched by Ingrid from Fighting Evolution—Capcom UK shares top 5 strongest characters in the franchise|first=Steven|last=Chavez|work=EventHubs|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Akuma's play style incorporates the trademark techniques of Ryu and Ken, the series' protagonists, only noticeably stronger in comparison along with additional techniques. Akuma has also been one of the characters with the lowest health and stun meter in most of the games he has appeared in. As the franchise expanded, the three characters have been differentiated somewhat while still retaining their common techniques (e.g. different regular attacks, throws, Super moves). In games where Akuma has appeared as a boss, he has had many upgrades, from extra meter to being able to use EX moves without meter at all.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Rich Knight of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' described Akuma as &quot;a character who must constantly be on the offense, because he takes a shit ton of damage when he's not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/08/best-street-fighter-history/akuma |title=7.

[[Fighting game community|Competitive]] ''[[Street Fighter V]]'' players have highlighted Akuma's poor health by being able to obliterate him with only two [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Ian|title=Street Fighter V Fans Are Highlighting Akuma's Flaws By Obliterating Him In Two Combos|url=http://compete.kotaku.com/street-fighter-v-fans-are-proving-akuma-sucks-by-oblite-1793775494|website=[[Kotaku|Compete]]|accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other video games===
Akuma has appeared in some form or another through many Capcom games outside the ''Street Fighter'' franchise. The first of these appearances was in the fighting game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'', where Akuma (in his ''Super Turbo'' incarnation) appears as a nameless hidden character. He also appears in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' as part of one of Anita's special moves, in which his sprite from ''X-Men: Children of the Atom'' briefly appears. He would appear in the later [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]-licensed fighting games (see ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series), including in ''[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'', where he also appears in mechanized form as &quot;'''Cyber Akuma'''&quot; ({{nihongo|Mech Gouki|メカ豪鬼|Meka Gouki}} in Japanese), a version of Akuma enhanced by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] acting as the horseman of Death and the final boss. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'', he appears as an alternate fighting style of Ryu; Akuma himself would later appear as a playable character in its sequels: ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''. He is also an unlockable character in ''[[Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix]]''. He also appears in [[Namco x Capcom]]. He appears as both a playable character and one of the final boss characters in the crossover fighting game ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]''. Akuma also appears in the fighting video game ''[[Street Fighter X Mega Man]]'', as a hidden boss.

In the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|SNK vs. Capcom]]'' series, Akuma appears in ''Capcom vs. SNK'' and ''SVC Chaos'' as both regular Akuma and as a version of &quot;Shin Akuma&quot;. In ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', a different form of Shin Akuma appears. This form of Akuma achieves a new level of power when a dying [[Rugal Bernstein]] pours his Orochi power into him. His name is spelled in Japanese as {{nihongo2|神・豪鬼}}, with the &quot;Shin&quot; character meaning &quot;God&quot; instead of the usual &quot;True&quot;.

Akuma also appears in ''[[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo]]'' As the final boss, ''[[Pocket Fighter]]'', and in the Japanese console version of ''[[Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness]]'' as a mecha named &quot;Zero Gouki.&quot; Also, various version of Akuma have appeared in the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'' series. He is featured in a DLC episode of the action video game ''[[Asura's Wrath]]'', alongside Ryu as an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/28/asuras-wrath-dlc-details-2|title=Asura's Wrath DLC Details|last=Krupa|first=Daniel|date=March 28, 2012|work=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma will appear as a special guest character in ''[[Tekken 7|Tekken 7: Fated Retribution]]''. In the game's story, he seeks to repay a debt to [[List of Tekken characters#Kazumi Mishima/Devil Kazumi|Kazumi Mishima]], who asks him to kill her husband [[Heihachi Mishima|Heihachi]] and son [[Kazuya Mishima|Kazuya]] for her if she dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/tekken-7-fated-retribution-announced-the-first-new-character-is-street-fighter-s-akuma-326097.phtml|title=Tekken 7: Fated Retribution announced, the first new character is Street Fighter's Akuma|first=Joe|last=Parlock|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=December 12, 2015|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arcade mode, Akuma can be fought in Final Stage, replacing Kazumi by performing Rage moves (either Rage Art or Rage Drive (Super Combo for Akuma)) in all stage's last round without losing any rounds.

==In other media==
Akuma made cameo appearances in ''[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]'' and in the Japanese TV series ''[[Street Fighter II V]]''. Actor and martial artist [[Joey Ansah]] played Akuma in the short film ''[[Street Fighter: Legacy]]''. Akuma also appear in ''[[Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist]]'', an online series by Capcom and the creators of ''Street Fighter: Legacy'' with Ansah reprised his role from Legacy and Gaku Space as Young Gouki. In ''Assassin's Fist'', both of Akuma's names are used; Akuma being the moniker Gouki had assumed after the Satsui no Hado took him over completely. Both Ansah and Space will return for the second season titled ''Street Fighter: World Warrior''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2012/07/13/third-times-the-charm-live-action-street-fighter-assassins-f/|title= Third time's the charm: Live-action Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist series announced|last= Mallory|first= Jordan|work= Joystiq|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]]|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate= January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/comic-con-capcom-greenlights-street-fighter-sequel-series-world-warrior-1201269367/|title=Comic-Con: Capcom Greenlights ‘Street Fighter’ Sequel Series ‘World Warrior’|first=Marc|last=Graser|work=Variety.com|publisher=[[Variety Media]]|date=July 25, 2014|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akuma's first speaking appearance in animation was in an episode of the American [[Street Fighter (TV series)|''Street Fighter'' animated series]] titled &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;. He reappears in another episode, &quot;The World's Greatest Warrior&quot;, in which he defeats Ryu and Ken's master Gouken, and challenges Gouken's two students to a duel.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Akuma also figures in the Japanese [[Original video animation|OVA]] ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'', where Ryu's encounters with Akuma triggers the &quot;Dark Hadou&quot; in Ryu. Akuma is also the central focus in the OVA ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: Generations]]'', which explores his past and ties the character's past with Ryu's.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Akuma appears in the beginning of the movie ''[[Street Fighter IV|Street Fighter 4: The Ties That Bind]]'', where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[UDON Entertainment]]'s line of ''[[Street Fighter (comic book)|Street Fighter]]'' comics sets Akuma in his origin story on how he became a demon and murdering Goutetsu with the power of the Dark Hadou; he fights against Gouken ten years later, as they fight, Gouken eventually wins against Akuma as he falls off a cliff; Gouken tries to save him, but Akuma willingly drops himself into a river, only for him to survive the drop.

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote= Akuma is the boogeyman of the martial arts world. A twisted monster who murdered (sort of) his own brother to prove a point. He wants to drive [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] to darkness for the sake of competition. He literally tears people’s souls apart with his bare hands in a move so out of control that we aren’t allowed to even see it happen. Yet at the end of the day, it’s hard to even label him as simply “evil.” He’s beyond the duality. He foregoes the ideas of being merciless for the sake of being merciless. He’s strangely respectful to children and doesn’t kill unless he has reason—either because someone has agreed to a fight to the death or because someone outright tries to go after him.|source=—Gavin Jasper, ''[[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]'', 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/street-fighter/252283/street-fighter-ranking-all-the-characters/page/0/6|title=Street Fighter: Ranking All the Characters|first=Gavin|last=Jasper|work=Den of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=July 17, 2016|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}

'''Alastair''' is a [[fictional character]] on [[The CW Television Network]]'s drama and horror television series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', appearing in its [[Supernatural (season 4)|fourth season]]. A particularly infamous torturer in Hell, he is portrayed in succession by actors [[Mark Rolston]], Andrew Wheeler, and [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] due to his demonic ability to possess human hosts. The writers created the character to explore series protagonist [[Dean Winchester]]'s experiences while in Hell, particularly Alastair's tutelage of Dean in torturing other souls. The character received generally favorable reviews from critics, with fans at the time considering him one of the series' best villains.

==Plot==
When [[Dean Winchester]] is sent to Hell at the [[No Rest for the Wicked (Supernatural)|end of the third season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=No Rest For The Wicked |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|credits=Writer: Eric Kripke, Director: Kim Manners|network=CW |airdate=May 15, 2008 |season=3 |number=16 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the [[Characters of Supernatural#Demons|demon]] Alastair who tortures him, stopping only when he eventually convinces Dean to torture other souls himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;heavenhell&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title= Heaven and Hell |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: [[Eric Kripke]] &amp; Trevor Sands, Director: [[J.

It's Me, Dean Winchester |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Sera Gamble, Director: Phil Sgriccia|network=CW |airdate=September 25, 2008 |season=4 |number=2 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alastair ([[Mark Rolston]]) makes his debut in the episode &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, in which he seeks to capture and interrogate [[Anna Milton]], a [[fallen angel]] who can still hear the conversations of other angels. Dean and his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] interfere,&lt;ref name=&quot;summer&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title= I Know What You Did Last Summer |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Sera Gamble, Director: Charles Beeson|network=CW |airdate=November 13, 2008 |season=4 |number=9 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sam's demonic powers are too weak at the time to harm Alastair.&lt;ref name=&quot;heavenhell&quot;/&gt; When they try to kill him with Ruby's demon-killing knife,&lt;ref name=&quot;summer&quot;/&gt; they accidentally stab him non-fatally,&lt;ref name=&quot;road&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester |year=2012|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-145-2|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the demon laying claim to the knife as the brothers flee the area with Anna and [[Ruby (Supernatural)|Ruby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;summer&quot;/&gt; Alastair is later tricked by Ruby and the Winchesters into a confrontation with the angels Castiel and [[Uriel (Supernatural)|Uriel]] in the episode &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; after torturing Ruby with her own knife for Anna's location. Alastair proves to be more powerful than the angels and quickly gains the upper-hand on Castiel, but is seemingly vaporized in the blast generated by Anna being restored to her angelic true form, the only thing left behind of Alastair being the demon-killing knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;heavenhell&quot;/&gt;

Alastair (Andrew Wheeler, with [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] soon taking over the role) returns in &quot;[[Supernatural (season 4)#ep75|Death Takes a Holiday]]&quot;, seeking to kill reapers to break another seal to Lucifer's cage. Though Alastair utilizes spell-work to prevent angels from actively interfering with his task, he is stopped by the Winchesters and captured by Castiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Death Takes a Holiday |series=Supernatural|credits=Writer: [[Jeremy Carver]], Director: [[Steve Boyum]]| network=CW |airdate=March 12, 2009 |season=4 |number=15 |episodelink=Supernatural (season 4)#ep75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean tortures him on Castiel and Uriel's orders in the following episode for information about a string of angel murders, but the demon refuses to disclose any information on that and instead reveals that Dean torturing souls in Hell broke the first seal. Alastair is eventually set free of his bonds by an unseen force and seizes the opportunity to attack Dean and Castiel, but is incapacitated and tortured by Sam, who forces him to admit that demons are not involved in the angel murders. When Alastair dares Sam to exorcise him, Sam uses his growing powers to kill the demon instead. It is later revealed that Uriel had freed Alastair; the one who has been killing angels, he had released Alastair in the hopes that the demon would kill Dean, and that demons would remain the suspects for the angel murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;pinhead&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title= On the Head of a Pin |series=Supernatural|episodelink=Supernatural (season 4)#ep76 | credits=Writer: [[Ben Edlund]], Director: [[Mike Rohl]]| network=CW |airdate=March 19, 2009 |season=4 |number=16 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
The original breakdown released to the media described Alastair as a &quot;calm and composed demon with a placid smile that belies his simmering sadism and evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;/&gt; Actor [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] deemed Alastair's lack of any goodness to be &quot;what makes him so much fun&quot;, stating, &quot;He just unabashedly loves creating havoc and pain and thinks it's the greatest thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
The breakdown also called him &quot;one of the top demons in Hell&quot; and &quot;electrifyingly powerful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2008/10/20/mark-rolston-jo/|title='Supernatural' Exclusive: Meet Sam and Dean's Worst Nightmare|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Knight, author of multiple supplementary books for the series, classified Alastair as a demon [[chief of staff]] at the top of the hierarchy of Hell, and suggested that the character might even be the second-oldest demon in existence in the show's mythos.&lt;ref name=&quot;road&quot;/&gt; Writer [[Sera Gamble]] supported this characterization by explaining that Alastair, unlike other demons who have no experience with angels, is &quot;exceptionally old and powerful, so he knows a trick or two&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;burningquestionsalastair&quot;/&gt; Likewise, actor [[Mark Rolston]] called him the &quot;[[John Gotti]] of demons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastairallhell60&quot;/&gt;

Regarding Alastair's relationship with Dean, Rolston found the demon to be a &quot;mentor&quot; who &quot;really took Dean under [his] wing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastairallhell60&quot;/&gt; The actor explained that his character had wanted Dean to be &quot;something great&quot; and that when Dean had been rescued from Hell by angels, Alastair felt &quot;kind of spurned or left out of the loop.&quot; Rolston felt that after Alastair gets retribution against Dean in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; for this &quot;wrong&quot;, the character is &quot;hoping [Dean] might come back into the fold&quot; when they meet again in &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastairallhell63&quot;&gt;Cairns, p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alastair works with Lilith in breaking the 66 seals and trying to capture Anna for information on angels, Gamble felt that he would &quot;rather be back in Hell, sticking bamboo shoots under fingernails&quot;, than starting the apocalypse. &quot;He's not a politician. He's a torture artist,&quot; Gamble explained, &quot;and he'd just as soon stick with what he loves. He's only topside because duty calls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;burningquestionsalastair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Supernatural-Questions-Answered-1001976.aspx|title=Supernatural: TVGuide.com Readers' Questions Answered!|author=TV Guide News|date=22 January 2009|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[Image:Christopher_Heyerdahl_at_The_Sanctuary_Experience_in_2010.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with long hair speaking into a microphone.|200px|right|Christopher Heyerdahl portrayed the third incarnation of Alastair.]]
Rolston had previously auditioned for the series, and joked that &quot;maybe they were just saving me for this particular role because [Alastair] was so wicked!&quot; The idea that a &quot;badass demon&quot; could be possessing an ordinary man helped inspire the voice he developed the character around. Rolston described it as &quot;particular, odd, and [sometimes] wicked, but at the same time, very believable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; The actor also collaborated with the hairdresser to create a &quot;weird style that looked normal and bookish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastairallhell60&quot;&gt;Cairns, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[J. Miller Tobin]] gave Rolston free rein over the character in &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, but did &quot;[reel him] back on occasion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastairallhell60&quot;/&gt; Overall, Rolston thoroughly enjoyed his time on the series, explaining, &quot;Actors that play bad guys get to explore the other side of their personalities, things that you wouldn't normally have the opportunity or inclination to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alastair140&quot;&gt;Knight, p.140&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he loved the character's &quot;big run of juicy dialogue&quot;, which was &quot;quite a bit to sink your teeth into&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastair140&quot;/&gt;

Noting that Alastair's relationship with Dean helps reveal the &quot;pertinent details of Dean's Hell story&quot;, Gamble revealed that the writers planned for Alastair to reappear in the fourth season after his introduction in the episodes &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, stating that there is &quot;more to come in a future episode&quot; about Dean's time in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Supernatural-Questions-Answered-1002240.aspx|title=Supernatural: More TVGuide.com Reader Questions Answered!|author=TV Guide News|date=29 January 2009|work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Heyerdahl viewed Dean's actor [[Jensen Ackles]]' humorous performance of the song &quot;[[Eye of the Tiger]]&quot; that was originally shown in the end-credits of the episode &quot;Yellow Fever&quot;. Heyerdahl felt that he would &quot;really love to work on that show [because] that guy looks like a lot of fun&quot;, and coincidentally was asked to audition for the role of Alastair just days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitboss38&quot;/&gt; Although he auditioned without having seen Rolston's episodes, his eventual viewing of those &quot;fantastic&quot; performances &quot;made [him] even more excited&quot; to portray the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastair140&quot;/&gt; To honor the &quot;music that [Rolston] brought&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pitboss38&quot;&gt;Lloyd, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Heyerdahl developed what he describes as &quot;a lovely three-way between what Mark had done, my own vision of the character, and the way director Steve Boyum played with the nuances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alastair140&quot;/&gt; Unlike Rolston, Heyerdahl insisted that he roll his eyes for Alastair's transition to fully white eyes&amp;mdash;the visual effects department usually adds this in during post-production&amp;mdash;because he &quot;just thought it was kind of fun&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Rolston's performance mostly received praise from critics.

Although she had viewed the decisions made to effect a Brando-esque voice for Alastair as &quot;merely irritating in previous episodes&quot;, she believed that Heyerdahl's performance was &quot;damaging&quot; in the torture scenes of &quot;On the Head of a Pin&quot; as they were &quot;campy to the point of being laughable&quot;, which &quot;seriously undercut their dramatic power&quot;.

Fans have shown Alastair positive reception.

'''Alex''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Anthony Burgess]]' novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', in which he is played by [[Malcolm McDowell]]. In the film, his [[surname]] is '''DeLarge''', a reference to Alex calling himself '''Alexander the Large''' in the novel. In the film, however, two newspaper articles print his name as &quot;Alex Burgess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collativelearning.com/ACO%20chapter%2021%20.html|title=A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in-depth analysis by Rob Ager 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the book and film, Alex was portrayed by [[Vanessa Claire Smith]] in the [[ARK Theatre Company]]'s [[multi-media]] adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'', directed by [[Brad Mays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arktheatre.org/|title=arktheatre.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradmays.com/clockwork.html Production Photos from ''A Clockwork Orange,'' 2003, ARK Theatre Company, directed by Brad Mays]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/20/clockwork-orange-musical_n_904375.html?ir=Arts&amp;ref=fb&amp;src=sp |title='A Clockwork Orange' Songs To Be Performed For First Time In History |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 20 July 2011|accessdate=2011-11-28 |first=Lucas |last=Kavner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Alex is the narrator, [[protagonist]] and [[antihero]] in the novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. He is portrayed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] who robs, [[rape]]s, and assaults innocent people for his own amusement. Intellectually, he knows that such behaviour is morally wrong, saying that &quot;you can't have a society with everybody behaving in my manner of the night&quot;. He nevertheless professes to be puzzled by the motivations of those who wish to reform him and others like him, saying that he would never interfere with their desire to be good; he simply &quot;goes to the other shop&quot;.

He speaks [[Nadsat]], a teenage [[slang]] created by author Anthony Burgess. The language is based on largely English and [[Russian language|Russian]] words, but also borrows from other sources such as [[Cockney rhyming slang]], [[Romani language|Romani]] speech, and schoolboy [[colloquialism]]s. His beverage of choice is milk spiked with various drugs, which he and his fellow gang members (&quot;droogs&quot;) drink to fortify themselves for &quot;ultraviolence&quot;. Alex is very fond of [[European classical music|classical music]], particularly [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], whom he habitually refers to as &quot;Ludwig Van&quot;. While listening to this music, he [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasizes]] about endless rampages of rape, [[torture]] and slaughter. Alex's favorite melee weapon is a &quot;cut-throat britva&quot;, or [[straight razor]].

==Character biography==
Alex lives with his parents in a block of flats in a [[dystopia]]n England in which his brand of &quot;ultraviolence&quot; is common. At the age of 15, he is already a veteran of state reform institutions. (In the film, he is somewhat older.) While the youngest of his gang, he is the most intelligent, and designates himself as the leader. Another member of the gang, Georgie, resents his high-handedness, and begins plotting against him. One night, the gang breaks into a woman's house, and Alex assaults and kills her. As Alex flees from the police, Dim hits him with his chain (a milk bottle in the film) and leaves him to be arrested. Alex is found guilty of murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Over the next two years, Alex is a model prisoner, endearing himself to the prison chaplain by studying the Bible. He is especially fond of the passages in the [[Old Testament]] portraying torture and murder. Eventually, prison officials recommend him for the Ludovico Technique, an experimental treatment designed to eliminate criminal impulses. During the treatment, prison doctors inject him with nausea-inducing drugs and make him watch films portraying murder, torture and rape. The treatment [[classical conditioning|conditions]] him to associate violent thoughts and feelings with sickness. Alex is particularly affected by watching footage of [[Nazi war crimes]] set to [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]], one of his favorite pieces of music, and he can no longer hear it without feeling sick.

His sentence is [[clemency|commuted]] to time served, and he is released. Once he returns to society, however, he finds that the treatment worked too well: any thought of violence brings him to his knees with pain, and he cannot defend himself. He is rejected by his parents, brutalized by his former victims, and beaten by his past rival, Billy Boy, and his former accomplice Dim – who are now police officers.

He collapses in front of an old house, owned by a writer the government considers &quot;subversive&quot;. The writer is one of the gang's victims, but he does not recognize Alex, who had been wearing a mask as he and his friends beat the man and [[gang-rape]]d his wife, who later died of her injuries. When Alex tells him of his plight, the writer promises to help him. However, the writer realizes who Alex is upon hearing him singing &quot;[[Singin' in the Rain]]&quot;, the  very song he had sung while raping his wife. He drugs Alex and forces him to listen to the Ninth Symphony, which causes Alex so much pain that he attempts suicide by jumping out of the window.

He survives, but is badly injured, and wakes up in a state hospital. His parents take him back, while the government, smarting from the bad publicity, gives him a well-paying job. The treatment, meanwhile, has worn off, and Alex is his old ultraviolent self again, saying &quot;I was cured all right&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heller |first=Jason |date=22 March 2010 |title=A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ia-clockwork-orangei-by-anthony-burgess-39379 |publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]'' |access-date=13 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the film ends here, the novel features an additional chapter in which Alex, now a few years older, outgrows his sociopathy and begins to think about starting a family.

'''Supreme Allah''' (real name '''Kevin Ketchum''') is a fictional character of the [[HBO]] drama [[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]. He is portrayed by [[Lord Jamar]] of [[hip hop]] group [[Brand Nubian (music group)|Brand Nubian]].

==Character overview==
''Prisoner #00K251. Convicted March 22, 2000 - Second degree murder. Sentence: 25 years, eligible for parole in 10.''

A [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percenter]], he is serving time for murdering Gray Daniels, a man who laughed at him during a dice game. He often preaches Five Percenter philosophy while simultaneously dealing drugs. It is revealed that Supreme is responsible for the incarceration of [[Augustus Hill]], having revealed Hill's location to the police after they picked him up on an old arrest warrant. As a result, [[Burr Redding]], Hill's adopted stepfather, hates Allah. Despite his numerous enemies, lack of real allies, and his controversial and occasionally contradictory beliefs, Supreme survives numerous murder attempts, though he is killed eventually. It is possible that Ketchum's character and religion are a reference to [[Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff]], a Five Percenter who ran the New York City based [[Supreme Team (gang)|Supreme Team]] drug organization. (Lord Jamar, who portrays the character, is himself a Five Percenter.)

==Season 4, Episode 5 - Grey Matter==
Supreme arrives in prison sponsored by [[Kareem Saïd]]. He is viewed as a threat by the Muslims since he preaches things that are as corrupting as they are enhancing. Rooming with [[Arnold &quot;Poet&quot; Jackson|Poet]], he finds himself an ally to [[Simon Adebisi]] and the Homeboys. Since the Muslims are being led by [[Zahir Arif]], Supreme claims Arif is nothing more than a &quot;Kareem Saïd wannabe,&quot; and he attempts to convert a few members such as [[Nacim Bismilla]]. When Arif asks Adebisi to kill Supreme, Supreme and the other Homeboys tell Arif to watch where he walks. Being on Adebisi's good side while Oz is under the management of [[Martin Querns]], Supreme is having a good time in Em City, not worrying about anything for the most part. Querns even names him and Poet trustees when the Italian and Latino inmates are transferred out of Em City. Supreme informs the black inmates (mainly [[Leroy Tidd]] and [[Mondo Browne]]) that they are being out-sold in drugs by Jamaican inmate [[Johnny Basil|Desmond Mobay]] whom he and Adebisi don't fully trust. This situation builds into tension between Supreme and Browne. Adebisi steps in to stop them from fighting. With only a few white inmates left in Em City, [[Ryan O'Reily]] and [[Christopher Keller]] (both white) conspire to disrupt Querns' system. They first murder [[Nate Shemin]] and then [[Mondo Browne]]. They successfully frame Supreme for the murders by planting Supreme's necklace at the scene and the murder weapon in Supreme's pod. The evidence is enough for Querns, who allows Supreme to be beaten by Adebisi and the all black correctional officers for ending Quern's streak of no violence. Supreme is sent to isolation and will stand trial for two counts of murder.

==Season 4 Part II==
Supreme Allah is released from isolation after it is determined there is not enough evidence to convict him of murder. While in the hole, he figures out that Keller and O'Reily set him up and he warns the two of them that they will pay for framing him. Meanwhile Burr Redding tells Augustus Hill that Supreme told the cops where he was the night he got arrested to avoid going to jail himself. Furious, Hill attacks Supreme Allah in the shower and is thrown out of his wheelchair and beaten by Supreme instead. Furious that Supreme assaulted Augustus, Burr Redding calls in [[Tug Daniels]]. Daniels' older brother was murdered by Supreme and Redding will give him a spot in the gang if he murders him. In the visiting room, Supreme is talking to his girlfriend explaining how he was unjustly sent to isolation when Tug Daniels approaches with a shank supplied by Poet and stabs him. Supreme goes to the hospital and Daniels is charged with attempted murder. In the hospital Supreme is attacked by inmate [[Omar White]] who is stopped by the S.O.R.T. team. Earlier when he was initially dismissed by Redding, [[Chucky Pancamo]], leader of the Italians, and [[Enrique Morales]], leader of the Latinos, approach Supreme. Looking for a way to kill Redding, they offer him a third in the drug trade if he kills Burr Redding. Supreme agrees after he gets support from other black inmates. When released from the hospital, he formulates a plan to eliminate Redding using Augustus Hill. Hill has been ostracized by Burr for alerting the S.O.R.T. team about White's plan to kill Supreme. He befriends Hill, telling him that he is sorry for snitching on him and that he is the best ally to have now that he has survived two murder attempts. Augustus does not fully trust Supreme though and does not initially go along with him. Supreme is also plotting with Tug Daniels, who has decided Supreme is a worthy ally after surviving the stabbing. In this plan, Supreme will pretend to work with Pancamo and Morales while Tug will pretend to work with Redding. A spy of Redding's, marine colonel Edward Galston in Oz, informs Burr of the plot, so Burr has Poet rent the gym from the COs to kill Tug Daniels. After this happens, Pancamo and Morales tell Supreme to hurry up and kill Redding. Growing frustrated, Supreme takes a shank and attempts to stab Redding in the cafeteria but is stopped by Augustus. Augustus, desperate to save Burr, pays Christian inmate [[Harden (Oz)|Harden]] to steal Supreme's medical records. He finds out Supreme is fatally allergic to eggs and tells Poet. The Homeboys and O'Reily fill his food with eggs and Supreme Allah dies from [[Anaphylaxis]] at the lunch table next to Augustus. Burr then forgives Hill and allows him to be an ally of the Homeboys again.

'''Jonathan &quot;Johnny&quot; Allen''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]. Johnny appears on the show from 4 January 2005 until 19 October 2006, when he suffers a fatal heart attack while serving his prison sentence. Johnny is one of the show's biggest villains, terrorising several other characters and going to extreme lengths to gain the upper hand over his rivals. An old East End gangster, Johnny is responsible for the deaths of [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) and is also central to the [[Get Johnny Week]] storyline that concludes in his eventual departure from the show.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Johnny Allen was born to a deprived family in [[Walford]] in the early 1940s. He was educated and grew up where he became familiar with the locals such as the [[Beale family]] and [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]). Johnny went on to become a boxer from an early age, but got involved in the criminal underworld. In the late 1950s, when he started as an up-and-coming gangster and he employed a well-known prostitute [[Pat Butcher|Pat Harris]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) with whom he had several flings before she married [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) in 1961. Johnny also employed a fellow boxer in the late 1960s, named Eric Mitchell. Johnny used to bully Eric because Eric was a better boxer than he was and the two developed a strong feud. Johnny also knew Eric's wife, [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), who used to try and seduce him out of desperation but he turned her down. Allen was a well-known man of the underworld and became notorious in the [[East End of London]] because he killed and tortured people including those who worked for him. Johnny left [[Walford]] when he grew older, presumably in the early 1970s, in order to expand his flourishing business empire named J.A. Enterprises but he still worked as a gangster but lived in his mansion in [[Essex]]. He married a woman named Stephanie, and they had two daughters: Scarlett (born 1986) and [[Ruby Allen|Ruby]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]), born in 1988. In 1994, he began an affair with [[Tina Stewart]] ([[Charlotte Avery]]), a barmaid who worked for him but was many years his junior, who went on to become his partner. His wife, Stephanie, and his eldest daughter, Scarlett, were killed in an arson attack by one of his criminal rivals in March 2004.

===2005–2006===
Johnny makes his first appearance to back-up [[Jake Moon|Jake]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) and [[Danny Moon]] ([[Jake Maskall]]) from the crime boss [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), who they have a feud with. Johnny soon begins appearing more often, to sort out the Moon brothers' problems. After a while, he buys the nightclub &quot;[[Angie's Den]]&quot; (renaming it &quot;Scarlet&quot;, after his deceased daughter) and the [[Ferreira family]]'s flat, and moves in with his remaining daughter, Ruby. The rivalry between Johnny and Andy Hunter escaltes, which leads to Johnny killing Andy by throwing him off a motorway bridge in February 2005, coincidentally on the same night of Den's murder; Andy's death is wrongly believed to have been suicide. After Jake and Danny buy stolen alcohol to use in Scarlet, Johnny fires them. After Johnny steals Danny's idea for a Salsa night at the club, Danny goes to Johnny's house in a drunken state, and sets it on fire. Johnny hunts down Jake and Danny, drives them to the woods and prepares to shoot Danny. Jake pleads for mercy, and Johnny then lets both of them go and orders them to leave Albert Square and never return. Jake, however, does return on his own in September, and tells Johnny he is there for personal reasons, so Johnny lets him stay.

Johnny's former mistress, Tina, follows him to Walford, and the two recommence their relationship. When Ruby finds out she is upset, but eventually accepts Tina and they live as a family for a while. But Johnny soon tires of Tina, and cheats on her with [[List of EastEnders characters (2005)|Amy]] ([[Nina Fry]]), one of the barmaids working at Scarlet. When Ruby discovers this she tells Tina, who leaves Johnny and the Square. After putting in an offer for [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], he sparks a war between him and Peggy, whose offer he outbids. It is soon revealed that there is history between the two; her deceased husband Eric had worked for Johnny, many years earlier, and they had also come across each other when it came to boxing. Generally, Johnny had mistreated Eric, and Peggy blames this for the reason Eric took it out on her. Peggy also has knowledge of Johnny's past crimes, such as cutting the fingers off the hand of a prostitute, and beating up a man for disrespecting him by misspelling something on a birthday cake. Ruby walks into the pub as the story unravels. It is here that Ruby began to learn of her father's true past, as well as the fact that he may be to blame for the death of her mother and sister.

Johnny's feud with the [[Mitchell family]] continues. In November 2005, Johnny notices that the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system at Scarlet has recorded [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) confiding in Jake Moon that she had been the one who had murdered her husband Den, a crime for which [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) is being held by the police. In order to provoke the Mitchells, Johnny deliberately lets them know about the tape, leading to [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) being involved in a stand-off with an armed Johnny. It is only diffused by Ruby, and the Mitchells leave with the tape. After some time Phil then pays [[Juley Smith]] ([[Joseph Kpobie]]) to have a relationship with Ruby, much to Johnny's annoyance. After Johnny argues with Juley at a party, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) throws Johnny out. Johnny threatens Sharon with violence and urges her to leave Walford with Dennis by New Year's Eve midnight, Johnny threatens to have Dennis killed if they refuse to leave, leading to Dennis brutally beating him up. A badly beaten Johnny calls an associate and orders him to kill Dennis. As Dennis walks across Albert Square, he is stabbed in the chest by a hooded passer-by, later revealed to be Danny, and dies. Johnny leaves Walford with Ruby soon after this on 19 January 2006.

On 28 March, as part of a week-long storyline entitled &quot;[[Get Johnny Week]]&quot;, Phil and Grant track down Johnny to his country house in [[Essex]], to get revenge for Dennis' murder. However Johnny catches the Mitchell brothers, and orders Danny to kill them. However, Danny's brother Jake arrives and shoots Danny, killing him instantly. Ruby discovers the true extent of Johnny's crimes, and contacts the police, threatening to disown Johnny if he doesn't confess. Johnny then hands himself in, and confesses everything about his life of crime. He is subsequently convicted of being involved in the murders of both Andy Hunter and Dennis Rickman, along with four others. He later receives life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should serve at least 27 years.

In October, Johnny appears in prison when Jake contacts him telling him he is concerned about Ruby's new relationship with [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]). Johnny arranges for Sean to visit him, where Sean taunts him, and gives out hints that he is only dating Ruby for her money. After the visit, a furious Johnny attempts to phone Jake to order him to kill Sean, but suddenly suffers a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] before he can dial. Believing that Jake is on the phone, Johnny manages to whisper &quot;Jake... kill him for me&quot; before falling unconscious. Johnny's cellmate hears his last words and mistakingly believes that Jake is the one he wants killed, leading to Jake being confronted by a stranger and presumedly killed while leaving Walford. Johnny is rushed to hospital where he dies.

'''Marcus Álvarez''' is a fictional character on the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and it's spinoff [[Mayans MC]], played by [[Emilio Rivera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/ Sons of Anarchy at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=40843 Hunnam, Glenn and Sagal in FX's Anarchy]&lt;/ref&gt; He initially serves as an antagonist on the show but gradually comes to a less hostile relation with the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club|Sons of Anarchy]]. He is the leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Mayans|Mayans]], a Mexican-American biker gang.

==Biography==
Álvarez, who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican descent]], is the President of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Mayans|Mayans Motorcycle Club]]'s [[Oakland, California]] chapter and seems to be their overall leader in [[Northern California]]. His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai Álvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.

On his [[gang colors|colours]], he wears patches reading &quot;Los Asesinos de Dios&quot; ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;God's Assassins&quot;) and &quot;Mayans Oakland&quot;.

===Season One===

At the beginning of the first series, Marcus Álvarez and his gang broke into the Sons of Anarchy's warehouse where they store their weapons. They stole the guns then burned the building down. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans [[heroin]] factory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Pilot/episode/1213971/recap.html Pilot - Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Darby]], the leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]], called a meeting with him to discuss taking out the Sons of Anarchy. He proposed that they team because; the Nords want to sell meth in Charming but are unable to because of the SOA, and the SOA sell weapons to the Mayans' rivals. Álvarez refused the offer, but did give his backing by offering Mayan security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Seeds/episode/1213972/recap.html Seeds - Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Josh Kohn]], a rogue ATF agent, sent Darby information on [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#True IRA|IRA]] and SOA weapon deals, he called another meeting with Álvarez. Darby told him to kill [[Clay Morrow]] and afterwords, the Nords could take Charming and the Mayans could take over the gun business. Marcus then told his son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Rivals|Esai]], to kill both Morrow and Darby. Later, when Clay was making a deal with the IRA at a bar, the Mayans attacked but were killed before they could get to him. They simultaneously assaulted Darby's home, but also failed to kill him. They broke in and shot a Nord footsoldier and two women, but Darby hid and escaped death.

When Clay Morrow was arrested for questioning about the shootings, he asked his associate and corrupt cop [[Wayne Unser]] to bring Álvarez in so that they could hold a meeting a halt any further violence. Clay told him that he would begin selling weapons to the Mayans if all SOA-Mayan disputes ended in the SOA's favour, to which he agreed. Later, one of Clay's men was ordered to kill Esai at a Mayan gathering for retaliation for his failed assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Hell+Followed/episode/1228115/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header Hell Followed - Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. Álvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was in fact a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Two===
At the beginning of Season Two, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans.  Jax dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, &quot;Yes, you do,&quot; and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.

In the episode &quot;Service&quot;, Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.

In the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.

===Season Three===
During the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's kutte. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.

When a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' leader go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged Bastards' leader.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.

When Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.

===Season Four===
He is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just &quot;looking out for my investments.&quot; Unlike previous seasons Álvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.

===Season Five===
Alvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they &quot;keep black (the Niners) in line&quot;. It is later stated the Mayans will take over the muling as well as SAMCRO wants out of the deal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13204">'''Cathy Ames''', later known as '''Kate Trask''' or '''Kate Albey''', is a fictional character and the main antagonist in [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]''. She is the wife of main protagonist Adam Trask, and the mother of his twin sons, Caleb and Aron. Beneath her charming, attractive facade, she is an [[evil]] woman who manipulates and destroys people for her own amusement and profit. Steinbeck characterizes her as a &quot;psychic monster&quot; with a &quot;malformed soul&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;East of Eden&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==

In 1951, Steinbeck wrote a series of letters, known as ''The Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters'', to his editor [[Pascal Covici]] during the process of writing ''East of Eden''.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot;&gt;Steinbeck, John. ''Journal of a Novel: East of Eden Letters''. New York: The Viking Press Inc. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, Steinbeck first mentions Cathy to Covici: “This is a woman and you must know her; know her completely because she is a tremendously powerful force in the book.”&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot; /&gt; The majority of these letters demonstrate that Steinbeck was most fascinated with Cathy’s character, mentioning once that he must get back to writing about his “dear Cathy”.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot; /&gt;

== Physical description ==
Steinbeck depicts Cathy as small-breasted, delicate, blonde and beautiful, with “oil-soaked” skin that gives her a “pearly-light” and a sense of allurement.&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot; /&gt; Her beauty fools most of the people she encounters, but a few characters detect her true nature by looking into her eyes, which Steinbeck describes as cold and emotionless. Samuel Hamilton, a supporting character in the novel, takes note that “the eyes of Cathy had no message, no communication…they were not human eyes”.&lt;ref name=&quot;eden7&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the novel progresses, Cathy becomes increasingly less attractive. She develops crippling [[arthritis]] in her hands, and by the end of the novel she is described as “a sick ghost”.&lt;ref name=&quot;eden6&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in the novel ''East of Eden''==

===Part 1===
Throughout Cathy’s childhood, she pointedly causes harm to anyone who holds a relationship with her. She uses her precocious sexuality to manipulate and destroy men; she frames two young boys for attempting to [[rape]] her, and drives her naïve [[Latin]] professor to commit [[suicide]] by toying with his affections. At a young age, she learns to mimic emotions she is incapable of feeling and con people into giving her what she wants. She attempts to run away once, at 16, to [[Boston]], but her father tracks her down and reluctantly whips her as punishment.  Afterwards she is a model student, and even certifies to become a [[school teacher]]. Consequently, her parents trust her enough to give her the combination to the family safe. Soon afterward, she robs the safe and burns down her family home while her parents are trapped inside, killing them.

She then runs away from her hometown and entrances a [[whoremaster]] named Mr. Edwards. The two become lovers for a time, until Edwards begins to suspect that she is being dishonest with him. He hires a detective who discovers a newspaper story about the death of Cathy's parents and her mysterious disappearance. Finally fed up, Mr. Edwards gives her a savage beating and leaves her to die. That night, Cathy is rescued by Adam Trask and his brother Charles. As Adam nurses Cathy back to health, he succumbs to her beauty and resolves to marry her. Cathy accepts his proposal in order to gain protection from Mr. Edwards. Charles sees through her and tries to warn his lovestruck brother, who refuses to listen. Part one ends with Cathy drugging Adam into a deep sleep and then having sex with Charles.

===Part 2===
After moving to [[California]] with Adam, Cathy becomes pregnant (the novel is ambiguous as to whether by Charles or Adam) and in turn attempts a [[Abortion|primitive abortion]] on herself with a knitting needle. She fails, however, and decides to carry on with the pregnancy. Though she warns Adam that she plans to leave as soon as she is able, he brushes this off as homesickness. She leaves her family a few weeks after giving birth to twin sons, and shoots Adam in the shoulder when he tries to stop her. 
	
Cathy then changes her name to Kate Albey and joins a [[whorehouse]]. She endears herself to the kindhearted madame, Faye, who eventually makes her new charge the main beneficiary in her [[will (law)|will]]. Kate begins secretly poisoning Faye, and finally kills her by overdosing her on [[pain medication]]. She then assumes full ownership of the whorehouse, which she turns into a den of [[sexual sadism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eden8&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 3===
The plot steers away from Kate’s life for some years, until her husband, Adam, visits her at the whorehouse. She reveals her motives for the first time, admitting that, from a young age, she took pleasure in using people: “I could make them do whatever I wanted…when I was half-grown I made a man kill himself.”&lt;ref name=&quot;eden10&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; She then shows Adam pictures of multiple public figures, including a [[Congressman]] and a [[priest]], who visit the whorehouse, and denounces the entire human race as a pack of hypocrites; she tells Adam that she’d “rather be a dog than a human.”&lt;ref name=&quot;eden10&quot; /&gt; Cathy attempts to seduce Adam, but he resists her temptations, which infuriates her.

Later on, Adam returns to give Kate $50,000 left to her by Charles, who has recently died. She is confused as to why Adam would show her any kindness, and refuses to believe in the sincerity of his actions. Adam finally sees Kate for what she is, and pities her, telling her: 
{{quote|And the men who come to you here with their ugliness, the men in the pictures &amp;mdash; you don’t believe those men could have goodness or beauty in them. You see only one side, and you think &amp;mdash; more than that, you’re sure &amp;mdash; that’s all there is.&lt;ref name=&quot;eden11&quot;&gt;Steinbeck,John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Part 4===
Years later, her son Cal visits her. Cal’s goodness makes Kate uncomfortable, especially when he states his love for his father, Adam: “a curious spasm shook [Kate] &amp;mdash; an aching twist tore in her chest.”&lt;ref&gt;&gt;Steinbeck, John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 39.&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief conversation, Cal leaves, telling Kate that she is simply afraid.

Soon, the truth of Faye’s murder starts to surface and Kate fears being found out. She covers up the truth by framing her employees Joe and Ethel, the only people who know what really happened. At this point, she loses the will to live, especially when she is visited by her second son Aron, who is disgusted by her. Literary critic Sarah Aguiar notes that this incident causes Kate to feel remorse for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanctuary&quot;&gt;Aguiar, Sarah Appleton. &quot;No Sanctuary.&quot; ''The Moral Philosophy of John Steinbeck''. Ed. Stephen K. George. USA: The Scarecrow Press, Inc, 2005. 145-253. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She signs over all her possessions to Aron, not Cal.&lt;ref name=&quot;eden12&quot;&gt;Steinbeck, John (1992).''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 51.&lt;/ref&gt; She then commits [[suicide]] by taking a lethal dose of [[morphine]].

==Archetypes==

===The Devil===
One of the main characteristics of ''East of Eden'' is the prevalent [[allegory]] with the [[Bible]] and the battle between good and evil. In a letter to family friend Allen Ludden, Steinbeck states that “Kate is a total representative of [[Satan]]”.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Steinbeck, John. Introduction. ''East of Eden''. By David Wyatt. New York: Penguin Books, 1992. vii-xxviii. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by John Timmerman, Steinbeck demonstrates the devil allegory through repeated [[snake]]-like imagery used to describe Cathy.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiction&quot;&gt;Timmerman, John. ''John Steinbeck's Fiction''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance in the novel, Samuel Hamilton observes that “when [Cathy] swallowed, her tongue flicked around her lips…the eyes were flat and the mouth with its small up-curve at the corners was carven”, giving a serpentine air to Cathy’s demeanor.&lt;ref name=&quot;eden15&quot;&gt;Steinbeck, John.''East of Eden''. 1952. New York. Penguin Books, 1992. Print. Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pandora===
Cathy also takes on the [[Pandora]] [[persona]] from classic [[Greek mythology]]. The story goes that [[Zeus]] gave Pandora a box and commanded her not to open it. She ultimately disobeys and when she opens the box, she sets loose evil into the world. In an academic article from the ''[[The Explicator]]'', Rebecca Barnes analyzes that Cathy is like Pandora in that her “broken box brings disaster” wherever she goes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pandora&quot;&gt;Barnes, Rebecca. &quot;Steinbeck's ''East of Eden''.&quot; ''The Explicator''. Vol 55, No. 3 (1997): 159. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel Cathy destroys every life she touches: she murders her parents, drives her Latin teacher to commit suicide, shoots her husband, poisons her benefactress, and [[Sadomasochism|sadistically]] abuses (and later [[blackmail]]s) countless men as a prostitute.

==Psychoanalysis==
In Stephen George’s article “The Emotional Content of Cruelty”, he writes that Cathy embodies hatred and fear, which he argues are the main motivators behind human cruelty.&lt;ref name=&quot;cruelty&quot;&gt;George, Stephen K. &quot;The Emotional Content of Cruelty: An Analysis of Kate in ''East of Eden''.&quot; ''The Moral Philosophy of John Steinbeck''. Ed. Stephen K. George. USA: The Scarecrow Press, Inc, 2005. 131-144. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that Cathy fears losing control in any way; for example, she refuses to drink because alcohol brings out her true nature. Her method of controlling her environment comes in the form of paranoia, which is manifested by her desire to manipulate men sexually.&lt;ref name=&quot;cruelty&quot; /&gt; The hatred she feels in effect subdues her fear so that she feels superior to those she manipulates.&lt;ref name=&quot;cruelty&quot; /&gt;

In her essay “No Sanctuary”, Sarah Aguiar writes that Cathy's actions are due to a perversion of human virtues such as compassion and love.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanctuary&quot; /&gt; Aguiar explains this deficiency is due to Cathy's “child-like egocentricity…the desperate need…to protect herself at all costs.”&lt;ref name=&quot;sanctuary&quot; /&gt; Steinbeck further comments in his ''East of Eden'' letters that Cathy is in part evil because her “life is one of revenge on other people because of a vague feeling of her own lack.”&lt;ref name=&quot;journal&quot; /&gt;

== Film adaptations ==
Actress [[Jo Van Fleet]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as Cathy Ames in the [[East of Eden (film)|1955 film adaptation of ''East of Eden'']].

In 1982, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] received a [[Golden Globe Award|Best Actress Golden Globe award]] for her portrayal of Cathy Ames in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[East of Eden (miniseries)|mini-series adaptation]] of ''East of Eden''. In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], Seymour commented that “there is nothing greater than playing evil incarnate. It is wonderful! It is an amazing experience, because you climb into a spirit or a soul that you have no idea you know, you can't even imagine it.”&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot;&gt;Seymour, Jane. Interview by Oprah Winfrey. ''Oprah.com''. Harpo Inc, 2006. Web. 26 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Jennifer Lawrence]] will play Cathy Ames in the upcoming adaptation of ''East of Eden'' directed by [[Gary Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-jennifer-lawrence-east-of-eden-20130926,0,2873688.story | title=Jennifer Lawrence to play 'East of Eden's' 'psychotic monster' | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=February 5, 2014 | author=Keegan, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Titus Andronicus''' is the main character and [[tragic hero]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play of the same name, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', a [[Senecan tragedy]].&lt;ref name=TACSN/&gt; Titus is a Roman nobleman and a general in the war who distinguished himself in ten years of service against the Goths.&lt;ref name=TACSN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/titus/characters.html|title=Titus Andronicus: Characters|accessdate=April 25, 2014|work=[[Spark Notes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his exemplary service the war's toll on him is sufficient that he declined the emperorship. Nonetheless, he begins the play as an exemplary citizen. However faith in the traditions of the Roman system of government eventually leads to his death as others seek revenge.&lt;ref name=TACSN/&gt;

==Comparisons==
Some sources claim that the name Andronicus comes from [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronicus Comnenus]], a 12th-century [[Byzantine emperor]], who shared Titus' proclivity for shooting arrows with messages attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGIqAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Titus+Andronicus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7KtYU92GHoXa2QWA4IHYCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Titus%20Andronicus&amp;f=false|title=The Tragedy of Titus Andronicus, Volume 30|accessdate=April 24, 2014|publisher=[[The MacMillan Company]]|date=1922|editor=Stoll, Elmer Edgar|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Anthony Hopkins]] played a stylized version of the character in the 1999 film ''[[Titus (film)|Titus]]'', he described the character as a combination of [[King Lear]] and [[Hannibal Lecter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C00E0D71539F937A15751C1A96F958260|title=Titus (1999): Film Review; It's a Sort of Family Dinner, Your Majesty|accessdate=April 24, 2014|date=December 24, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Holden, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Titus Andronicus is the main character, some productions have adapted the play to be seen through Young Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/shakespeare/index.php/title/21736|title=Titus Andronicus|accessdate=April 25, 2014|publisher=[[British Universities Film &amp; Video Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in play==
{{Further|Titus_Andronicus#Synopsis}}
The play begins with Titus returning home after many years at war with the [[Goths]], bringing with him the remaining 4 of his 25 sons. Titus is selected by the people of Rome to be the new emperor but refuses this offer due to his already advanced age. In his stead he chooses the former emperor’s eldest son Saturninus. By the ceremonial sacrifice of his most noble captive, Alarbus - the eldest son of Tamora, Queen of the Goths - Titus unknowingly sparks off a series of events that are motivated by the desire for revenge. Throughout the play Titus seeks revenge on Tamora for injustices against his family while simultaneously being the target of Tamora’s own quest for revenge. Titus murders five people during the play, including one of his sons and his daughter. Displaying strict adherence to Roman law he murders his son, Mutius, for defying the order he has given for his daughter Lavinia to marry the new emperor Saturninus. The second act of [[filicide]] occurs at the end of the play when Titus murders Lavinia so that she will not have to live with the shame of having been raped and mutilated on Tamora’s orders by her sons Chiron and Demetrius. In Titus’ final act of revenge upon Tamora he kills Chiron and Demetrius and uses their blood and bones as the ingredients of a pie. “Let me go grind their bones to powder small, / And with this hateful liquor temper it, / And in that paste let their vile heads be baked”(5.3.197-199).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/titus/full.html|title=Titus Andronicus (full text)|accessdate=April 24, 2014|publisher=MIT.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titus serves this pie to Tamora before killing her. As is customary in a Shakespearean tragedy and as a Senecan hero,&lt;ref name=TACSN/&gt; Titus Andronicus also dies in the end, killed by Saturninus who is then in turn killed by Titus' last remaining son, Lucius, bringing to an end the cycle of revenge that has prolonged the play.

The '''Angel Gang''' is a fictional group of [[villain]]s appearing within the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' [[comic strip]] in the weekly [[comic book]] ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''. They are &quot;a family of scruffy, [[wikt:backwoods|backwoodsy]], outrageously cruel thugs&quot; from the [[Cursed Earth]] near [[Megacities in Judge Dredd#North America|Texas City]] who vie with the titular [[Judge Dredd#Character and appearance|Dredd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt;

==Publication history==
The Angel Gang were created by the writers [[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and the illustrator [[Mike McMahon (comics)|Mike McMahon]] for the ''Judge Dredd'' comic strip in ''2000 AD''. They first appeared in Prog (issue) 160 of ''2000 AD''  as the [[antagonist]]s of the &quot;[[The Judge Child|Judge Child]]&quot; storyline, during which each of the four members were [[Kill off|killed off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JudgeChild&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|title=[[The Judge Child]]|date=1980|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 160 to Prog 181|publisher=[[Time Inc. UK|IPC Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angel Gang were &quot;hugely popular with readers&quot;, leading Wagner to introduce a fifth Angel, Fink Angel, in Prog 193 (first published in 1981).&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt; In the same storyline, Wagner also introduced the background character of Ma Angel in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFink&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner|T.B. Grover]]|title=The Fink|date=1981|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 193 to Prog 196|publisher=[[Time Inc. UK|IPC Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner reintroduced Mean Angel in the ''Destiny's Angels'' storyline that ran from Prog 281 to Prog 288 (first published in 1982), stating &quot;he was just too good a character to throw away, and somehow he suited miracle rebirth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DestinysAngels&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]|title=Destiny's Angels|date=1982|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 281 to Prog 288|publisher=[[Time Inc. UK|IPC Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mean Angel went on to become a recurring antagonist until Prog 1536 (first published in 2007) in which he was effectively written out of ongoing storylines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FiftyYearMan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]]|title=Fifty-Year Man|date=2007|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 1536|publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seemingly killed off once more in a 2015 story appearing in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RisingAngel&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Carroll (author)|Michael Carroll]]|title=Tales from the Black Museum: Rising Angel|date=2015|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 5, #358|publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Prog 958 (first published in 1995), Wagner reintroduced Elmer and Junior Angel, [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ning their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Awakening&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]]|title=Awakening of Angels|date=1995|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 958|publisher=[[Fleetway Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;resurrection&quot; of Elmer and Junior proved unpopular with readers, with author John Wagner later stating in an online interview: &quot;We got away with resurrecting Mean Machine, I think. He was just too good a character to throw away, and somehow he suited miracle rebirth, but I confess in hindsight Pa and Junior were a step too far. I don't think I'll be using them again&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Duane Swierczynski]]|title=Judge Dredd #9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVn6AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=7 November 2013|publisher=IDW Publishing|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, the appearances of the Angel Gang in ''2000 AD'' have largely been restricted to flashbacks and strips set prior to their deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt; The 2007 strip &quot;Before They Wuz Dead&quot; by [[Simon Spurrier]] [[wikt:flesh out|fleshed out]] the character of Link Angel and explored the relationships between the family members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurrier&quot;/&gt; In 2008, Wagner introduced another member of the Angel Gang, Ratfink.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratfink&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]]|title=Ratfink|date=2008|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 5, #273 to #277|publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratfink made a second appearance in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratfink'sRevenge&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]]|title=Ratfink's Revenge|date=2012|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 5, #328 to #330|publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angel Gang returned in 2015 in &quot;Angelic&quot;, a strip by [[Gordon Rennie]] that further explored their backstory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angelic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Gordon Rennie]]|title=Angelic|date=2015|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 5, #356-359|publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the surviving members of the Angel Gang in the current storyline are Elmer Angel, Junior Angel, Ratfink, and Mean Junior.

===Storylines===
Elmer &quot;Pa&quot; Angel and his wife, &quot;Ma&quot; Angel are [[outlaw]]s, formerly in the employ of the gangster Dil Grimczi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurrier&quot;/&gt; They live in a [[shack]] in the [[Cursed Earth]] to the north of [[Megacities in Judge Dredd#North America|Texas City]]. Elmer and Ma have four children, Fink, Link, Mean and Junior, with Ma  [[maternal death|dying giving birth]] to Junior. Elmer vows to raise the four boys to be &quot;the most vicious, [[wikt:orneriest|orneriest]], baddest family the world's ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFink&quot;/&gt;

As his sons grow up, Elmer becomes concerned that Mean is not vicious enough. He kidnaps a surgeon from Texas City and forces him to implant a dial in Mean's forehead that controls his temperament, along with replacing Mean's right arm with a bionic substitute.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFink&quot;/&gt; Mean is later briefly engaged to the outlaw Sarah &quot;Seven-Pound Sadie&quot; Suggs. Suggs leaves Mean before the wedding, but not before he has fathered a son with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonOfMean&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]]|title=Son of Mean|date=1994|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 2, #63 to #72|publisher=[[Fleetway Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Fink becomes increasingly solitary, ultimately leaving his family to live alone in the Cursed Earth, with Elmer occasionally summoning him to assist the Angel Gang with their schemes, including an attempt to purloin Grimczi's legendary treasure in 2101.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurrier&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFink&quot;/&gt;

Judge Dredd first encounters the Angel Gang in 2102 during his quest to locate [[The Judge Child|Owen Krysler, the &quot;Judge Child&quot;]]. Elmer, Link, Mean and Junior have escaped from detention in [[Megacities in Judge Dredd#North America|Texas City]], and are anxious to escape the planet. Hearing of the Judge Child's precognitive abilities, they obtain him from a carnival worker, intending to sell him, and unleash a monster on the pursuing Dredd before fleeing Earth. Dredd tracks them to the planet of Xanadu, where they commit many murders. Realising that Dredd is in pursuit, Elmer instructs Link and Mean to set an ambush for Dredd in the town of Drybone while he and Junior leave with the Judge Child. Mean and Link ambush Dredd, but are killed when Mean inadvertently headbutts a [[Fuel dispenser|gas pump]], causing an explosion. Dredd pursues Elmer and Junior into the &quot;Robot Free State&quot; ruled by a robot, The Grunwalder.  Dredd wounds Elmer with a 12&amp;nbsp;km shot from a long-range rifle and Junior is left behind to ambush him while Elmer seeks the Grunwalders protection.  He outflanks Junior and sentences him to death by throwing him into the volcano, enraging Elmer who attacks Dredd before also falling into the crater - but survives by grabbing an outcrop of rock. The Judge Child then uses his [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities to deflect Dredd's bullets, and crack the rock, causing Elmer to fall to his death. This act also confirms Dredd's opinion that the Judge Child is evil and unsuitable to rule MegaCity One.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JudgeChild&quot;/&gt;

Later in 2102, Fink Angel and his companion Ratty journey to Dredd's home of [[Mega-City One]] to take vengeance on Dredd and his team from the Judge Child mission, having learned of his family's fate from a discarded newspaper. Fink is ultimately defeated by Dredd and [[Judge Hershey]] and imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheFink&quot;/&gt; In 2104, Mean Angel is magically returned to life by Owen Krysler using a &quot;resurrection [[elixir]]&quot; to take revenge on Dredd for abandoning Krysler on Xanadu. Mean joins forces with the freed Fink and attacks Dredd in his apartment. Fink and Ratty do not survive this second encounter with Dredd, but Mean Angel is captured.&lt;ref name=&quot;DestinysAngels&quot;/&gt;

In 2117, 15 years after their apparent deaths, Elmer and Junior Angel are revealed to still be alive, having been placed in [[suspended animation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Awakening&quot;/&gt; They are subsequently brought to Mega-City One by Dredd and used as a bargaining chip to persuade Mean Angel to assist Dredd.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThreeAmigos&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner]] and [[Trevor Hairsine]]|title=The Three Amigos|date=1995|work=[[Judge Dredd Megazine]] volume 3, #2 to #7|publisher=[[Fleetway Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three family members were later incarcerated together in the [[supermax prison]] &quot;Iso-Block 666&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballad&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Wagner|T.B. Grover]]|title=The Ballad of Devil Angel|date=1995|work=[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]], Prog 965 to Prog 966|publisher=[[Fleetway Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, Mean repeatedly [[Prison escape|escapes from prison]], only to be recaptured each time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt; During one of his escapes, Mean encounters his now 13-year-old son, Mean Junior, who he unsuccessfully attempts to instill criminal tendencies in.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonOfMean&quot;/&gt; Mean's periodic escapes continue until 2129, when he is rendered docile when his dial and claw are removed via [[microsurgery]] and released into the custody of Mean Junior.&lt;ref name=&quot;FiftyYearMan&quot;/&gt; Upon the release of the [[Day of Chaos|Chaos Bug]] in 2134, Mean is infected, temporarily returning him to his murderous personality. Upon recovering, a guilt-ridden Mean parts from his son and exiles himself from Mega-City One, where he dies heroically helping free a group of slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;RisingAngel&quot;/&gt;

The final member of the Angel Gang to encounter Dredd was Ratfink, a poisoner and [[highwayman]], in 2130. Ratfink was ultimately captured by the Judges at considerable loss of life, with Dredd ordering him interrogated and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratfink&quot;/&gt; In 2134, Ratfink escapes from custody and captured Dredd, torturing him until Dredd took him prisoner once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratfink'sRevenge&quot;/&gt;

===Judge Dredd movie===

The Angel Gang appeared in the [[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|movie version]] of ''Judge Dredd'', wherein they were represented as religious fanatics and [[cannibalism|cannibals]]. Pa Angel was played by [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]; Mean Machine by [[Christopher Adamson (actor)|Christopher Adamson]]; Link by [[Phil Smeeton]]; and Junior by [[Ewen Bremner]]. Fink did not appear in the film. Dredd encounters them when his shuttle is downed by them and they capture him, but he quickly frees himself and kills them in combat.

The novelization based on the film took Pa's fanaticism even further—to &quot;keep out evil spirits&quot;, Pa had sewn shut his ears, eyes, and mouth. He thus communicated in a series of muffled words and grunts.

Mean Angel's costume and [[Prosthesis|prosthetics]] in the movie were designed by ''2000 AD'' artist [[Chris Cunningham|Chris Halls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swierczynski2013&quot;/&gt;

==Plot details==

Jackie Aprile Jr. was born into North Jersey mafia family. His father, [[Jackie Aprile Sr]]., was once the acting boss of the [[DiMeo crime family]], and his uncle [[Richie Aprile]] was a capo first under [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Ercole &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo|Ercoli &quot;Eckley&quot; DiMeo]], and then later under [[Tony Soprano]]. However Jackie Jr. himself was kept away from the family business by Jackie Sr. and his father's best friend, [[Tony Soprano]]. He only began getting involved with the criminal aspects of his family in 2000—season 2 of ''The Sopranos''—after the death of his father and the release of his uncle from prison. Despite attempts to succeed at [[Rutgers]], Jackie Jr. drifted towards a life of crime as he began helping his uncle Richie run the Aprile crew.&lt;ref name = &quot;Knight in White Satin Armor&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Knight in White Satin Armor | episodelink = Knight in White Satin Armor | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[Allen Coulter]] (director); [[Robin Green (producer)|Robin Green]] and [[Mitchell Burgess]] (writers) | network = HBO | airdate = 2000-04-02 | season = 2 | number = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;EG25&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/season2/episode25.shtml |title=Episode guide - Episode 25 - &quot;Knight in White Satin Armor&quot; |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother [[Rosalie Aprile]] began a romantic relationship with Soprano capo [[Ralph Cifaretto]]. Ralph was more of a mentor in Jackie's attempt to follow in his father's footsteps and was actively involved with his life or development as a young man. It was Richie's and then Ralph's bad influence, Jackie Jr.'s own faults, and finally Tony's insistence that Jackie Jr. ''not ''become involved in organized crime that were the contributing factors that propelled Jackie Jr. into a brief, and rather humiliating career in organized crime.&lt;ref name = &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Proshai, Livushka | episodelink = Proshai, Livushka | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[Tim Van Patten]] (director); [[David Chase]] (writer) | network = HBO | airdate = 2001-03-04 | season = 3 | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;EG28&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/season3/episode28.shtml |title=Episode guide - Episode 28 - &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot; |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Fortunate Son | episodelink = Fortunate Son (The Sopranos episode) | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[Henry J.

Jackie Jr. began dating [[Meadow Soprano]] and as a result, he copied the Mafia tradition of leading two lives. Jackie tried to maintain the appearance of a respectable college student dating Meadow while drifting further into the Mafia life. Tony's interest was further increased because he had been a close friend of Jackie's father and had promised that he would keep Jackie, Jr. away from organized crime. Tony began to see through Jackie's facade when he caught him at the casino on Bloomfield Ave and then later at a strip club.

Things came to a head after Jackie Jr. flunked out of [[Rutgers University]]. Jackie was subsequently dumped by Meadow after she found him cheating on her. Resentful of two generations of the Sopranos, Jackie began working directly for Ralph, forming his own minor crew in the process.&lt;ref name = &quot;…To Save Us All From Satan's Power&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = …To Save Us All From Satan's Power | episodelink = …To Save Us All From Satan's Power | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[Jack Bender]] (director); [[Robin Green (producer)|Robin Green]] and [[Mitchell Burgess]] (writers) | network = HBO | airdate = 2001-04-29 | season = 3 | number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;EG36&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/season3/episode36.shtml |title=Episode guide - Episode 36 - &quot;…To Save Us All From Satan's Power&quot; |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Pine Barrens&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Pine Barrens | episodelink = Pine Barrens (The Sopranos episode) | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[Steve Buscemi]] (director); [[Tim Van Patten]] and [[Terence Winter]] (story), [[Terence Winter]] (teleplay) | network = HBO | airdate = 2001-05-06 | season = 3 | number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;EG37&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/season3/episode37.shtml |title=Episode guide - Episode 37 - &quot;Pine Barrens&quot; |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing Ralph tell the story of when Jackie Aprile Sr. and Tony robbed a card game held by [[Feech La Manna]], Jackie became inspired to follow in his father's footsteps. Using his dim-witted crew of [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Carlo Renzi|Carlo Renzi]], [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Dino Zerilli|Dino Zerilli]] and [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Matush|Matush]], Jackie attempted to hold up a card game run by Aprile soldier [[Eugene Pontecorvo]]. The young stick-up men got high and Jackie almost decided not to go through with it.

Hiding out in the Boonton Projects, Jackie called Tony and begged for help saying that he was imitating Tony and Jackie when they were younger. Tony rebuffs Jackie, saying they were different scenarios with different results. Largely because of his feelings toward Jackie Sr., Tony suggested to Ralph that Jackie should be given a pass for the failed robbery. At a meeting between Tony and Ralph about what to do about Jackie, Tony stated that the important thing is that action is taken &quot;in a timely fashion.&quot; Ralph of course had to maintain stability and his stature with Tony and the crime family. He gave Aprile crew soldier (and Jackie's cousin) [[Vito Spatafore]] the order to take out Jackie. Outside the Boonton Projects, Vito shot Jackie Jr. in the back of the head, leaving Jackie's body face down in the snow.&lt;ref name = &quot;Army of One&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Army of One | episodelink = Army of One (The Sopranos episode) | series = The Sopranos | serieslink = The Sopranos | credits = [[John Patterson (director)|John Patterson]] (director); [[David Chase]] and [[Lawrence Konner]] (writers) | network = HBO | airdate = 2001-05-20 | season = 3 | number = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;EG39&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/sopranos/episode/season3/episode39.shtml |title=Episode guide - Episode 39 - &quot;Army of One&quot; |publisher=[[HBO]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosalie, Meadow and the rest of the family were told that Jackie was killed by black drug dealers. The death of Jackie Jr. had an enormous effect on [[Meadow Soprano]] and she began having mixed feelings for her father and his &quot;business.&quot; At his funeral Jackie's sister [[List of characters from The Sopranos - friends and family#Kelli Aprile|Kelli Aprile]] said that it was Jackie's life dream to follow in their father's footsteps and first introduces the idea to Meadow that Jackie was killed by the Mafia.

'''Arcade''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in 1978's ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 1) #65, created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. The character is a combination of [[villain#The evil genius villain|evil genius]] and [[hitman]] who carries out his assassinations via various elaborate traps, often referred to as his ''[[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]]''. He was the main villain and driving force behind the 2012-2014 comic book ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.

Arcade's first intended victims were [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]] but since Arcade's ''Murderworld'' games always leaves the outcome up to chance the duo defeated Arcade and escaped with their lives. Over the years Arcade has targeted a multitude of [[X-Men]] and members of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. For a while he used the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]] as his hired henchmen with limited success.  In ''Avenger Arena'' Arcade and his associates manage to kidnap 16 super powered teens and force them to fight each other and his latest ''Murderworld'' for survival. During the storyline several of the teens were killed but in the end Arcade seemingly dies as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Hank Pym]] and Captain Britain free the surviving teens. In the follow up series ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'' it was revealed that Arcade survived and that it was a clone that was killed at the end of the story. 

Arcade has appeared in a number of other Marvel properties outside of comic books, in the  ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' cartoon, voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]] and in an episode of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. He has also appeared as one of the main villains in a number of video games, including ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]'', ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'', ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'' and ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Marvel Team-Up 66.jpg|thumb|Arcade's first full appearance in [[Marvel Team-Up]] #66.]]
Arcade was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Arcade first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', vol. 1, issue #65 (the same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic [[Marvel UK]] title ''[[Super Spider-Man &amp; Captain Britain]]'' #248).&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 bears a cover date of January 1978. During this period, comic books published by Marvel Comics U.S.A. carried a [[cover date]] three months ''in advance'' of the actual date of publication. This means the actual publication date of ''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 was October 1977. The first issue of ''Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain'' to feature the Arcade storyline was published in England on November 8, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
A combination of [[villain#The evil genius villain|evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed &quot;[[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]]&quot;.

Arcade's [[back-story]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]], or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, his [[allowance (money)|allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]]. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million, he would tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch as they are killed by the variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his &quot;gimmicks&quot; is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him &quot;If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!&quot; Arcade laughs and replied, &quot;Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance.&quot; This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.

[[File:Arcade (supervillain).png|250px|thumb|left|Arcade, from ''[[X-Men (comics)|X-Men]]'' #122 (June 1979).&lt;br /&gt;Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]].]]
Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1) #65-66&lt;/ref&gt; Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes.

In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #197&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (Vol. 1) #50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Spider-Man]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1) #89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]''#1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deadpool]] and Hercules, and [[Iron Man]] and [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].

Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Green Goblin]] ([[Phil Urich]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Green Goblin'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doctor Doom]], [[Northstar]],&lt;ref&gt;''Northstar'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Courtney Ross]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], and the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Micronauts'' (Vol. 1) #45&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civilians to escape Arcade's attention alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]]) and discovering a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (which doesn't last long, as she is soon killed by an unrelated villain).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (Vol. 1) 04-05 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tunes parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' (Vol. 1) #31-38&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] and [[Shatterstar]], who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival; his Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, which he discovers is infested with demonic beings, destroying all the obstacles in his sight and killing what he can. He then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Blaze'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to a confrontation with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in a fit of rage. During the struggle, she wounded him with a carving knife and scarred much of his face. Over time, Arcade recovered from the physical trauma (presumably through facial surgery, though that has never been confirmed or even addressed in future stories) and even built a series of Miss Locke androids, virtually identical to her in ever way, to replace his now-dead companion.

He is responsible for the destruction of [[District X|Mutant Town]], as part of a botched plan to kidnap X-Factor's [[Rictor]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (Vol. 2) #29-31&lt;/ref&gt; He later surfaced, confronting [[Deadpool]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]],&lt;ref&gt;Deadpool Team-Up #899&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dazzler]],&lt;ref&gt;X-Necrosha: Dazzler&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Torch]] and the [[Impossible Man]].&lt;ref&gt;Fantastic Four #580&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] and [[Avengers Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Avengers Academy Giant-Size #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In a shift from his usual modus operandi, Arcade is responsible for the &quot;[[Avengers Arena]].&quot; He and a new associate named '''Miss Coriander''' abduct 16 teenage superheroes (several with ties to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], including several members of [[Avengers Academy]]) and strands them on a deserted island, re-modified as an elaborate Murderworld location, forcing them to fight to the death.&lt;ref name=&quot;AvengersArena&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=40986 |title=Hopeless and Walker Populate &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; For Marvel NOW! |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=13 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avengers Arena #1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later, in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', several Murderworld survivors gather in Bagalia and are convinced by fellow hero [[Cullen Bloodstone]] to kill Arcade at the Massacrer Casino in revenge for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; After a chaotic battle, Hazmat finally kills Arcade by blowing him to bits with a concentrated radiation burst (as a way to avenge her boyfriend Mettle and those who died in his &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; Murderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was revealed later that Arcade  was actually alive the entire time, imprisoned in a Masters of Evil cell (with assistance from his now former comrade Ms. Coriander) and that Hazmat had in reality killed a clone made by members of the Masters of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Masters of Evil]] get away on a hijacked Helicarrier, it was shown that they strapped Arcade to the front of it.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Undercover'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

He has most recently been seen running a Murderworld operation on Coney Island, where he encountered [[Patsy Walker]] and her friends.&lt;ref&gt;''Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later revealed to have captured [[Gwenpool]] and her former M.O.D.O.K. teammates and trapped them in Muderworld. Arcade and his forces are then defeated by Gwenpool, Deadpool and the mercenaries, who then escape from Muderworld.&lt;ref&gt;''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' Vol. 1 #12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arcade's other impacts==
One of his old facilities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team [[X-Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #40&lt;/ref&gt; They planned to base crimefighting and even attendance in a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base remotely; X-Force barely escapes with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Prime''&lt;/ref&gt; Another old Murderworld location was converted into a training room by an incarnation of the New Warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Warriors]]'' (Vol. 4) #3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madripoor]] Island-ruler [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities. She uses it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons. Though restricted in the use of their powers, they manage to overcome the challenges and save lives.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #448-449&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three-part miniseries called ''&quot;Claws&quot;,'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the &quot;assistance&quot; of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the [[Savage Land]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine/Black Cat: Claws'' #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but has absolute genius-level knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually when he appears to be captured, it turns out to be a robot.

In ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medical skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; series, Arcade easily held back a cadre of 16 high-powered teenage superheroes seemingly without having to resort to mechanical or technological devices of any sort. He displayed the ability to create force fields, proved to be nearly invulnerable to energy blasts without the force field, controlled the motor functions of his 16 captives all at the same time, employed telekinesis, caused nearby matter to form into a throne for him to sit on, and effortlessly blew apart an almost invulnerable mutant with a simple gesture. These abilities though, are the result of technology provided by his henchwoman, Miss Coriander and can only be manifested within the confines of the Antarctica Murderworld.

==Associates==
* '''Miss Locke''' - Arcade's bodyguard and chief enforcer, is an expert in martial arts and gun combat. According to a flashback sequence in &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; #7 (2013), he murdered her in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade's mind, had tried to get &quot;too close&quot; to him by having an emotional and physical relationship.
* '''Mr. Chambers''' - Arcade's henchman who has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld's system operations and maintenance. In several appearances he is the driver of a vehicle (disguised as a garbage truck) that would often capture Arcade's victims for transport back to Murderworld.
* '''Miss Coriander''' - Arcade's latest henchman, she claims to be responsible for the vast array of powers that Arcade currently employs in his underground base seen in the &quot;Avengers Arena&quot; storyline. She appears to far surpass even Arcade in terms of knowledge about superhuman powers and how to counter them, and has gifted Arcade with a vastly powerful set of abilities that she has purloined from cutting-edge technology, exotic energy sources, and magical power. She later betrays Arcade after his supposed death and is currently in league with [[Baron Zemo|Baron Zemo's]] Masters of Evil.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Arcade is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Marauders]], a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], alongside [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Age of Apocalypse|Red]], [[Kingpin (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Dirigible]], and the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]].

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X (comics)|Age of X]]'' universe, Arcade was the [[Superintendent of Jail|prison governor]] of the mutant prison.

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
It is revealed that Arcade has been captured by Deadpool and forced to build deathtraps used to kill various members of the X-Men. He begs Wolverine to save him, horrified by the things Deadpool wants him to build. Wolverine instead kills Arcade for his involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Adventures===
In this version, Arcade has an actual amusement park in order to entertain the kids; he is skillful in robots and highly arrogant. After [[Mister Fantastic]] ruins his robots, he decides to prove to be superior to Mr. Fantastic and lure him into his Murderworld. There, Mr. Fantastic defeats all the traps and turns all the robots against Arcade. Arcade is taken into custody and Mr. Fantastic learns to be more tactful.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Arcade traps high school student [[Flash Thompson]] in a new arcade machine and uses the young video gamer as a tester to destroy New York City. Eventually, Spider-Man breaks up Arcade's scheme and saves his schoolmate.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret Wars (2015)===
In the Marvel Universe recreated by Doctor Doom, Arcade is the master of ceremonies at the Killiseum, an arena on the outskirts of Doomstadt built to entertain the masses of Battleworld. Here he encountered such heroes as Captain America and the Hulk&lt;ref&gt;Planet Hulk #1&lt;/ref&gt; and Thunderbolt Ross the War Machine.&lt;ref&gt;Battleworld #2&lt;/ref&gt; He also oversees the Ghost Racers event, which pit the various individuals possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance (including Carter Slade, Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, Alejandra Blaze, and Robbie Reyes) against one another in violent races around a booby-trapped track. Thanks to the determined leadership of the unbeaten Reyes, the Ghost Racers would eventually break free of their captivity and kill Arcade.&lt;ref&gt;Ghost Racers #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter [[Video game|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants. He is apparently a skilled hunter and tracker, equipped with various high tech weapons and equipment. When the Ultimate Universe version of [[Longshot]] is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and [[Human hunting|hunted by opponents]]. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] trying to save the prisoner. He subdues them and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious. He is last seen being tied to a tree by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with some scraps of iron.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

===What If?===
In a reality where Wolverine was transformed into the Horseman of War by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and then killed his maker and ran rampant on the Marvel Universe, Arcade was one of many X-foes who were slain by the rampaging mutant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' (Vol. 1) #111&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Arcade appeared in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]]. This television  reimagines Arcade as high school gamer '''Webber Torque''' (who calls himself Arcade) and is tricked by a disguised [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console and [[Danger Room]] is an elaborate video game. He uses it to attack the X-Men which he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil and apologizes for having played the &quot;video game&quot; without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of the X-Men to be his schoolmates.
* Arcade appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. This version is an Asian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Technopathy|who can communicate with any type of technology]], while Murderworld is referred to as &quot;Madland&quot;. In this version, Arcade is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Madland for his own childish amusement, regardless of possible consequences of his actions. In the episode &quot;Game Over&quot;, he plans to crack the codes to nuclear missiles where he plans to cause World War III. He started by sending a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] which is defeated by [[Captain America]] as Arcade speaks through the Life Model Decoy. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] traces Arcade's transmission to [[Madripoor]] as Spider-Man joins up with Captain America to head to Madripoor. Upon the approach to Madripoor, Arcade takes control of Captain America's plane in order to crash it. Spider-Man and Captain America bail out to fight off Arcade's drones. Upon meeting up with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] after some ninja Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade then unleashes Life Model Decoys of Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine. After the three Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade unleashes three Life Model Decoys modeled after the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Captain America and Wolverine defeat the Life Model Decoys of Hulk while Spider-Man destroys an array of lasers. When escaping to the next level upon evading the Life Model Decoys of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], Arcade unleashes a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] and other robots. Spider-Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots. Afterwards, Arcade is angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to cancel the codes. Arcade is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

===Video games===
* Arcade was one of the main villains in the video game ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.
* Arcade appears as the main villain in the [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]''.
* Arcade appears as a boss in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Doctor Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot called the Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm. His fate is unknown after that. Arcade was also the villain on [[Deadpool]]'s simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this ''probably'' is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther's]] disc, threatening T'Challa to give the secret codes to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium (comics)|vibranium]] facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] disc where she fights [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] and the versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]]. Arcade has special dialogue with [[Mister Fantastic]] (at the Pinball Machine), and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] (in via [[Xbox 360]] DLC and Gold Edition), [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] (at the Disco Drop), [[Luke Cage]] (before the fight), [[Captain America]] (after the fight), and [[Deadpool]] (in his simulation disk). He also have a special dialogue with [[Magneto]] at the Disco Drop in Murderworld's Funhouse, which was never being used in the gameplay.
* A [[Marvel 2099]] version of Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16765/spider-man_edge_of_time_available_now |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Available Now |publisher=Marvel.com |date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He control a game cyber-arena in the year 2099 to hunt down and destroy heroes in front of a live-audience. He seeks to challenge Spider-Man (who is stranded in the year 2099), but is defeated.
* Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. He is featured in the 15th Spec-Ops that is loosely based on ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.

'''Anton Arcane''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain who first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' vol. 1 #2, and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Arcane is a scientist whose obsession with gaining immortality has led him to create monstrous creatures known as &quot;[[Un-Men]]&quot; as well as other monstrous biogenetic experimentations involving the dead. He was able to resurrect his deceased brother Gregori as the [[Patchwork Man]]. He is also a skilled magician, which he is able to channel through his horrific experiments.

Living in the mountains of Europe with his niece [[Abigail Arcane|Abigail]], Arcane was introduced in ''Swamp Thing'' volume 1 #2 after luring the plant based hero to his castle home. Arcane sought to use his scientific and magic abilities to transform his body into Swamp Thing's form, while changing Swamp Thing back into Alec Holland. At first very grateful to be human again, Alec soon overheard Arcane discussing his evil intentions now that he can carry them out. Alec then succeeds in breaking the spell Arcane cast, and sacrifices his humanity, so Arcane becomes a frail old man again. Pursued by Swamp Thing, Arcane fell to his death, only to be resurrected by his minions in a new body. He then attacked Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, the first time as a hulking corpse-like beast (only to be destroyed by vengeful ghosts) and later as a spider-like cyborg piloting a massive dragonfly-like vehicle. It is after his third death that his soul was consigned to [[Hell]].

Arcane's soul later escaped from Hell and ultimately helped to summon the [[Monkey King (comics)|Monkey King]] into the world.

After a fight with Abigail that culminated in her leaving on foot to find Swamp Thing, Matt Cable (Abigail's husband) had an attack of conscience and drove after her. He had been drinking heavily and wound up crashing his car, leaving him mortally wounded.  Ultimately Arcane managed to possess Cable's body, and with it gained access to Cable's godlike power.

In his body, he masquerades as Cable, claiming a new job called Blackriver Recorporations and buying a mansion for them to live. Arcane combined his own magic with Cable's inherent [[psychic]] powers to alter reality and the employees of Recorporations were the resurrected souls of deceased serial killers returned from Hell. He finally revealed himself, tormenting his niece and causing havoc and insanity by altering reality on a massive scale. For miles around natural and unnatural disasters occurred, people succumb to homicidal instincts and the resurrected serial killers returned to killing.

He once again battled Swamp Thing, accompanied by monstrous forms resembling Un-Men, after killing Abigail and condemning her soul to Hell, all the while declaring the earth as his now.

It was during this battle that Arcane found that the Swamp Thing was an elemental and thus possessed semi-magical abilities allowing the Swamp Thing to combat him on a more even ground. The battle was enough for Matthew Cable to regain control of his body, and Arcane was [[exorcism|exorcised]] directly back to Hell. Cable uses his awakened power to resurrect Abigail's body, but not having sufficient power to repair himself, becomes [[coma]]tose and finally dies, whereupon he becomes [[Matthew (Sandman)|Matthew]], a [[raven]] living within [[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]].

Arcane next appears as a [[demon]], having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell.  He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents of his evil ways after having briefly found [[God]], who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is [[torture]]d by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant.

After Abigail was able to fight off the mental control of [[Sethe (comics)|Sethe]], Sethe revives Anton Arcane from the dead.&lt;ref name=st9&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #9 (July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Anton Arcane is a regular antagonist in the monthly Swamp Thing comics.&lt;ref name=st9 /&gt; Arcane is now the new avatar of The Black (aka The Rot) trying to take over The Red (colliding with [[Animal Man]] as well) and The Green. Anton also has a son named William Arcane and Abigail is his daughter in this timeline.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #0 (November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 5) #11 (September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

During Animal Man and Swamp Thing's one year in The Rot, Anton Arcane and the forces of The Rot were able to take over parts of Earth. It was mentioned by [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] that Anton Arcane had imprisoned someone beneath Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; When the forces of The Red and the forces of The Green converge outside of Anton Arcane's castle, Anton Arcane unleashes corrupted versions of Maxine Baker and Abigail Arcane.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #17 (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Arcane and The Rot's conquest of Earth is thwarted and undone when Maxine breaks the hold of the remaining Hunter's Three on her.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Man'' (vol. 2) #18 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
After being defeated by Swamp Thing, Arcane is put in a hell specifically made for him by the Parliament of Decay when nothing ever rots and all is forever pure. Abigail as the new avatar of the Rot comes to him demanding information about her mother. Arcane revels that when she was a baby she already had power over the Rot and she accidentally killed her by 'filling' her with the Rot. To make him talk Abigail lets him feel rot but she now says he will never escape his hell and will never touch rot again. Arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him he became stronger than he been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and Alec Holland. As she teleports away Arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal. On earth a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten. He throws it away and Arcane's eye appears in it.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol 5) #23.1 (September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Swamp Thing'' #36, vol 5, when Swamp Thing goes in the Rot to warn Abigail about the new realm of machines she initially assumes he is there because of Arcane who has escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' (vol 5) #36 (November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Anton Arcane possesses genius-level intellect. He possess the knowledge of creation of synthetic organs and skin through which he made his Un-Men. He initially wanted to create a body and transfer his consciousness into it so he could make himself immortal within a tireless form instead of in his normal aged, worn body. He also possessed many arcane artifacts. He possesses necromancy which enables him to control the dead.
 
In the New 52, Arcane was brought in as the avatar of the Rot just as Alec Holland is avatar of the Green. As the avatar he could manipulate rot, death and decay to his will. He main objective was to simply help the spread of rot but he caused a wave of carnage as he thought that killing was the best sacrifice for the Rot. He then found a way of allowing rot in a living being, causing decay before death. When Swamp Thing and Animal Man are trapped within the Rot Arcane uses this 'living' rot on everyone except those who have a strong enough connection to the Red (animals) or the Green (plants), such as Poison Ivy or [[Man-Bat]]. There are ways to prevent the living rot, such as using the Man-Bat serum, but only if used before being completely controlled by it. These rot zombies can be weakened or even killed with Alec Holland's bio-restorative formula. Arcane's Un-Men were normal people who gave themselves to the Rot.

'''Arclight''' ('''Philippa Sontag''') is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]]ess appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Arclight first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210-211 (October–November 1986), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

The character subsequently appears in ''X-Factor'' #10 (November 1986), ''Thor'' #373 (November 1986), ''Power Pack'' #27 (December 1986), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (January 1987), 215 (March 1987), 219 (July 1987), 221-223 (September–October 1987), 240 (January 1989), ''Captain America'' #387-392 (July–September 1991), ''X-Man'' #13 (March 1996), 18-19 (August–September 1996), ''Cable Annual 1999'', ''X-Men: The 198-Files'' (March 2006), ''X-Men'' #183 (April 2006), ''X-Men: The 198'' #2-5 (April–July 2006), ''Civil War: X-Men'' #3 (November 2006), ''X-Men'' #200-203 (August–November 2007), and ''New X-Men'' #46 (March 2008).

[[Walt Simonson]] said that &quot;when [[Jon Bogdanove]] drew Arclight in ''Power Pack'', she had a much different figure than I gave her in ''X-Factor''. But I went back and did a little bit of revision work in my book after I'd seen what John had done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Sanderson | authorlink = Peter Sanderson | date = October 1986 | title = Walt &amp; Louise Simonson | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 39 | page = 44 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arclight received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Arclight served with the American ground forces during the [[Vietnam War]], and she is still haunted by memories of that place.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #10 (November 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; She has redirected her rage into bodybuilding, which she uses to augment her mutant powers.  Her mutant ability enables her to create [[shock wave]]s through physical contact, usually combined with her super strength in form of punches and blows.  During a few of her appearances she has been shown to project a bright light upon impact of her hands.

As a war veteran, she is well versed in battle and is known as one of the most bloodthirsty members of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], the group responsible for the &quot;[[Mutant Massacre]]&quot;. Her relationship with teammate [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] has also made her second-in-command. During their first mission, Arclight kills dozens of underground-dwelling mutants known as [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;/&gt; She also took some time off to answer [[Superia]]'s invitation to join her female group of villains, the [[Femizons]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power Pack'' vol. 1 #27 (December 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the details of her recruitment by [[Mister Sinister]] to the Marauders remain unrevealed, she has participated in all of the group's major operations.  Due to Sinister cloning the Marauders multiple times, it is hard to determine if the 'original' Arclight has been present in all of them.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Arclight became one of the so-called [[X-Men: The 198|198]], one of the few remaining mutants retaining their powers, and a refugee at the [[X-Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The 198'' #2-5 (April–July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; She later returns as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old members like Scalphunter and new ones like [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Lady Mastermind]].&lt;ref&gt;[[X-Men: Legacy|''X-Men'' vol. 2]] #200&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah CompleX]] in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is injured by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] who bites her in the neck.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #200-203 (August–November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; She is seen later being defeated by [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]].&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #46 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Arclight possesses the ability to generate seismic energies with her hands that cause shock waves and geo tremors. She also has superhuman strength, stamina, durability and resiliency.

==Other versions==
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Arclight (alongside [[Mentallo]] and Wild Child) is a member of the Red Guard that was positioned in Australia to work with Exodus.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Arclight appeared in the two-part ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode &quot;Sanctuary.&quot; She is among the mutants that join [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Asteroid M|mutant haven]]. In the episode &quot;Secrets Not Long Buried&quot;, she is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arclight first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode &quot;eXcessive Force&quot;. This Arclight is male, and he is supposedly the field leader of the Marauders taking direct orders from Mister Sinister. He utilizes the same shock wave powers as his mainstream and movie counterparts. When Vertigo arrives to warn him about Cyclops coming, he is attacked while Vertigo flees. Mister Sinister gets contacted by him and is given orders to give Cyclops information that would lead him into a trap.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine &amp; The X-Men'' episode &quot;eXcessive Force&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
* Arclight appeared in the 2006 motion picture ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' played by [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] fashion [[Model (person)|model]] and [[actress]] [[Omahyra Mota]]. Arclight had no lines in the film. In the movie, her shock wave-based superpowers are more refined than in the comic book: her shock waves project in an outward fashion and she can target specific materials. She is a member of the Omegas. During the raid on Alcatraz, Arclight used her shockwaves to disable the cure weapons and later joined [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] and [[Psylocke]] in targeting Warren Worthington II. She, Quill, and Psylocke are later killed by Jean Grey's disintegration wave when her Dark Phoenix side activates.

===Video games===
* Arclight appears in ''[[Deadpool (video game)|Deadpool]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/gamenews.php?id=103948 The Marauders Confirmed for Deadpool Video Game],&quot; ComingSoon.net&lt;/ref&gt; She serves as the game's first boss. The encounter ends with Arclight dying on a piece of rebar.

'''Ares''' is a character on the television shows ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' and ''[[Young Hercules]]''. He was portrayed by New Zealand actor [[Kevin Tod Smith]]. Ares is a significant recurring antagonist during the first three seasons, makes a guest appearance in the &quot;coda&quot; episode of season four and was Xena's main love interest during seasons five and six. He is the primary antagonist of Season 5, wishing to derail the Twilight of the Gods, but changes once he realizes Xena's life is more important to him.

==Ares on ''Xena: Warrior Princess''==
Suave, charming, witty, yet ruthless and amoral, Ares often represents, especially in the early seasons, the seductive power of war and the dark side. He repeatedly attempts to lure [[Xena]] away from her quest for redemption alongside [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]], and to win her over as his Warrior Queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;reckoning&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Reckoning|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1995-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers her huge armies and historic victories, great wealth and great power, and in later seasons his love,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soul&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Soul Possession|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers which she consistently rejects despite being sometimes tempted.

Much of Ares' relationship with Xena remains [[Wikt:ambiguous|ambiguous]], including whether he is at least partly redeemed by his love for Xena, or to what extent Xena reciprocates his feelings. He says several times that he has &quot;a thing&quot; for Xena, and this seems to prevent him from killing her, even when pitted against her in deadly combat.,&lt;ref name=&quot;furies&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Furies|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ties&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Ties That Bind|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet he pursues her sexually and romantically.

Their relationship prior to the show's timeline is also a mystery. The dialogue in an early episode strongly suggests that this is their first face-to-face meeting;&lt;ref name=&quot;reckoning&quot;/&gt; subsequent episodes, however, establish that at some point in the past he trained her and may have been her lover as well. It is also stated that Ares gave Xena her signature weapon, the [[chakram]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chakram&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Chakram|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;They had this idea for the God of War,&quot; Kevin Smith remembered. &quot;They wanted a foil for Xena - someone who could beat her in battle, and a former mentor. The weird thing is there's sympathy for the character, because he's done terrible, terrible things and yet, at the bottom of it all, the only way this works is if you believe he truly loves Xena. Of course Ares did admit his love for her and Xena never said it but she loved Ares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'' (London, 20 February 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The story===
During season 1, Ares frames her for murdering three villagers in the hope that she will call on him for help when threatened with execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;reckoning&quot;/&gt; He also takes the shape of her long-lost father Atrius and nearly tricks her into attacking a village. However, these plans are thwarted by Xena and Gabrielle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ties&quot;/&gt;

In a Season 2 episode, Ares joins forces with Xena's now-dead archenemy, [[Callisto (Xena)|Callisto]] [[Kirra, Phocis|of Cirra]], and engineers a [[Body swap|body switch]] so that Callisto's soul occupies Xena's body while Xena is trapped in [[Tartarus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stranger&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Intimate Stranger|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He seems to be grooming Callisto-in-Xena's body to be his new Warrior Queen, and has sex with her,&lt;ref name=&quot;stranger&quot;/&gt; but later turns away from her, realizing that she is too madly obsessed with revenge against Xena and too uncontrollable. Xena, who persuades [[Hades]] to release her, is able to send Callisto back to Tartarus.

In the next episode, the audience sees a different side to Ares for the first time. After losing his godhood due to the trickery of [[Sisyphus|king Sisyphus]] [[Corinth|of Corinth]], he needs Xena's help to get it back; Xena reluctantly agrees to help him after realizing that the world needs a ''god of war'' and Ares is the best man for the job. As a mortal, Ares shows a new humanity and conscience, but after getting his godhood back he seems to revert to his former cold-hearted self.&lt;ref name=&quot;warlords&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Ten Little Warlords|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1996-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 3, Ares' relationship with Xena grows more complicated; he is still trying to win her back into the fold, using the [[Furies (Xena)|Furies]] to drive her mad for that purpose,&lt;ref name=&quot;furies&quot;/&gt; but also tries to form an alliance with her to fight the evil god [[List of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess characters#Other Gods|Dahak]]. Under threat from Dahak, Ares ends up briefly switching sides until Dahak is defeated by Xena. Ares also makes an unusual appearance in the musical episode where, as the &quot;Emperor&quot; in the fantasy land of Illusia, he personifies the seductive appeal of the dark side. The tango Ares and Xena dance to Ares' song, &quot;Come Melt into Me&quot;, also highlights the erotic chemistry between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;bittersuite&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Bitter Suite|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1998-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares' character on ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' evolves dramatically in Season 5. A major part of the season's storyline involves the Twilight of the Gods and the rise of monotheistic religion. Determined to protect his own power and the rule of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], Ares kills [[Eli (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Eli]], a [[Jesus]]-like [[prophet]] who urges the people to abandon the old gods and the old ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeds&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Seeds of Faith|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, however, Ares becomes less of a villain and more of a romantic interest. The sexual tension between Xena and Ares, and the suggestion that he is secretly in love with her, have been there all along. As early as Season 1, it is clear that he can't kill her; as a mortal, he suggests that she can inspire him to change.&lt;ref name=&quot;warlords&quot;/&gt; His obsession with her is evident as well. It is also suggested that he might be her father,&lt;ref name=&quot;furies&quot;/&gt; but this scenario is later dropped. In Season 5, the theme of Ares' love for Xena is brought out into the open. After the [[Moirai|Fates]] prophesy that Xena's child [[Eve (Xena)|Eve]] will bring about the end of the Olympian gods, Ares tries to declare his love for Xena, offering to protect her and her baby from the other gods and willingly become mortal if they can be together and have a child of their own and/or raise Eve as their own. Xena rejects his offer, refusing to believe that his feelings are sincere.

When Xena and Gabrielle fake their deaths to escape the gods' persecution, Ares inadvertently thwarts their plans by burying them in an ice cave where they sleep for 25 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;death in the eye&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Looking Death in the Eye|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After mourning Xena for years, Ares unknowingly takes Eve, now the Roman warrior Livia, as his protégée and lover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livia&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Livia|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Xena returns, he resumes his pursuit of her. Enraged by her continuing rejection, he first encourages Livia to kill her, and then joins the other Olympians in their effort to kill Eve. However, when Gabrielle and Eve die and Xena temporarily loses her power to kill gods, Ares love for Xena prevails, and he gives up his godhood to resurrect Gabrielle and Eve, enabling Xena to kill [[Athena (Hercules and Xena)|Athena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Motherhood&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Motherhood|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Season 6 premiere, Xena risks her life to save the now-mortal Ares from the Furies.&lt;ref name=&quot;coming home&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Coming Home|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2000-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the episode, the two share a tender kiss, and Xena tells Ares, &quot;''You always got to me. But you were bad for me, Ares; you still are.''&quot; She also says that the chance of them ever going beyond friendship is &quot;''one in a billion''&quot;.

Later in the season, Xena helps Ares again, hiding him from vengeful warlords on her family's farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;old ares&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Old Ares Had a Farm|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She restores his godhood with a [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apple]] wrested from [[Odin]], but refuses his offer to become a goddess and rule by his side.&lt;ref name=&quot;you are there&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=You Are There|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next episode,&lt;ref name=&quot;path of vengeance&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Path of Vengeance|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=2001-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ares and Xena are once again adversaries as she foils his plot to get the [[Amazons]] into a war with the Romans in order to gain more worshipers. However, they also seem to share a new mutual understanding and acceptance.

The &quot;uber&quot; episodes of ''Xena'', set in the future, suggest that at some point Ares is imprisoned in a tomb from which only a descendant of Xena's can free him,&lt;ref name=&quot;scolls&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Xena Scrolls|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1997-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that after getting out of the tomb, he continues to pursue a reincarnated Xena in the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soul&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deja vu&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Deja Vu All Over Again|series=Xena: Warrior Princess|serieslink=Xena: Warrior Princess|airdate=1999-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ares on ''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys==
[[Image:Ares Demon.jpg|alt=A dark menacing horned monster with glowing white eyes.|200px|thumb|left|Ares in non-human form]]

The character of Ares on ''Hercules'' is quite different from his character on ''Xena''. In the show's first season, prior to Ares' appearance on ''Xena'', Ares appears in non-human form as a skull in the moon or a fountain of blood, and in one episode, he takes the form of a slain warrior. He first appears in the familiar form of Kevin Smith in the Season 3 &quot;Hind trilogy&quot;, in which Hercules falls in love with Serena, a mysterious woman who sometimes becomes a golden hind and who is a protegée of Ares. Ares tells Hercules that he will release Serena from her vow of service to him, and allow her and Hercules to marry, if Hercules gives up his superhuman strength. Later, Ares' underling, the god Strife, kills Serena and he and Ares attempt to frame Hercules for her murder. He is saved by the intervention of Xena and [[Zeus]].

Ares' main goal on ''Hercules'' is to kill his demi-god half-brother, both because Hercules constantly stands in his way by preventing wars and because he resents his father Zeus' preference for Hercules. Ares' schemes are invariably thwarted. In later episodes of ''Hercules'', he changes from a dark villain to a more comical one. This is especially true following the rise of evil entities such as Dahak, or the rise of a more powerful God in ''Xena: Warrior Princess'' which sought to destroy all Pantheons of gods and become the sole ruler. While most of the Olympians are destroyed during this time, Ares remains a mortal and appears in many comedic episodes such as &quot;Old Ares Had a Farm&quot;.

In a Season 4 episode, it is revealed that Ares had sired a child with the now-mortal Goddess of Revenge, [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;two men&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Two Men and a Baby|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1997-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child, Evander, is born with supernatural abilities, particularly [[telekinesis]]. Ares wants to take the boy from Nemesis and raise him to be loyal to him, hoping to use him as a weapon against Hercules. However, Hercules and [[Iolaus]] manage to foil his plan and return the child to his mother. Later in that season, Ares teams up with Callisto, now a goddess, to trap Hercules in a passageway between parallel worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;armageddon&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Armageddon Now, Part 1|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1998-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto, working with Dahak's daughter [[Hope (Xena)|Hope]], then turns on Ares, gets thoroughly beaten up by him in a hand-to-hand fight (during this, Ares admonishes her, &quot;Pain?  I invented it!&quot;).  However, she is then &quot;recharged&quot; with supernatural energy by Hope, turns the tables and roundly defeats Ares, and finally uses a dagger dipped in the blood of a golden hind, lethal to gods, to kill Strife. In the Season 4 finale, Ares plots with his mother [[Hera]] to kill Zeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;reunion&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Reunions|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1998-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 5, Ares and Hercules briefly team up to stop the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] from destroying the world by unleashing the [[Apocalypse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;revelation&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Revelations|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1999-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the show's finale, Ares is back to plotting against Zeus, this time by releasing two of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] once imprisoned by the gods, but Hercules and Iolaus stop him again.&lt;ref name=&quot;full circle&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Full Circle|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1999-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two episodes the series introduced a parallel world in which Ares is a ''god of love'' wearing white and without facial hair, while [[Eros (mythology)|Cupid]] is a ''god of war''.&lt;ref name=&quot;strange world&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Stranger in a Strange World|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1997-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strangerandstranger&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Stranger and Stranger|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1999-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares also appears in two Hercules &quot;uber&quot; episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginia&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Yes, Virginia, There is a Hercules|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1998-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joining us&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=For Those of You Just Joining Us|series=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|serieslink=Hercules: The Legendary Journeys|airdate=1998-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these episodes, which are set in the present day and based on the premise that [[Kevin Sorbo]] is actually the immortal Hercules himself, Ares is still at war with his half-brother and is plotting to get ''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'' off the air.

==Ares on ''Young Hercules''==
Ares' role on ''Young Hercules'', is similar to his role in ''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys''. Apparently he has been trying to destroy his younger brother, the &quot;apple of his father's eye&quot;, since he was a teenager starting out training at Cheiron's Academy, still with the help of his sister Discord and his underling Strife, though he's going to have to try to rid the world of the world's future greatest hero by getting around the protection order Zeus has placed upon his demigod son.

==Powers and abilities==
Ares possesses most of the abilities of a god. He has shown superstrength at times and cannot feel pain or be killed unless affected by Hind's blood or more powerful gods such as Dahak. Ares can teleport around Earth and to Mt. Olympus at will. He can also turn invisible to everyone or just certain people, though it has been shown that Xena can sense his presence even when invisible. His offensive powers are fire balls and lightning bolts. He also has telekinetic abilities, can heal people or bring them back to life, and time travel as seen in ''Hercules: The Legendary Journeys'' episodes ''Armageddon Now'' part 1 and 2. Ares possesses combat prowess similar to Hercules and Xena. He is also a great swordsman. Ares has had several sidekicks, including Strife, Discord and Deimos. His favorite warrior is Xena and he tries to use Serena but ends up killing her. Ares also has a demon-dog creature named Greigus in the first season of ''Hercules'' that he tries to use to kill Hercules but fails.

Ares is shown to be a skillful manipulator and a master strategist.

'''Amadeus Arkham''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]]. He was the founder of [[Arkham Asylum]] and is the uncle of [[Jeremiah Arkham]].

==Publication history==
He was created in 1984 for the entry for Arkham Asylum in ''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #1. The story was retold and expanded in 1989 in ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]''. The graphic novel is interspersed with flashbacks to Arkham founder Amadeus Arkham's life and childhood. The character currently appears in DC's [[The New 52]] as a [[protagonist]] of [[All Star Western]] alongside [[Jonah Hex]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Who's Who entry establishes that the Asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder Amadeus Arkham. The original name of the asylum was Arkham Hospital. Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]] (It was later revealed that her son actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her, and repressed the memory). Amadeus Arkham decided, then, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer as his mother had. Prior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he and his wife, Constance, and daughter, Harriet, had been living for quite some time.

Upon telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[serial killer]] [[Mad Dog (DC Comics)|Martin &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Hawkins]] &amp;mdash; referred to Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital &amp;mdash; had escaped from prison, and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the [[rape]]d and mutilated bodies of his daughter and wife in an upstairs room, with Hawkins' nickname carved on Harriet's body.

The shock of the murders brings back the memory of killing his mother. For many years Elizabeth suffered delusions that she was being tormented by a supernatural creature, and would call to her son to protect her. One day, however, he finally sees what his mother saw - a great bat, a spectre of death. Taking a pearl-handled straight razor from his pocket, he cuts his mother's throat to end her suffering. He then blocks out the memory, and attributes her death to suicide.

Traumatized, Amadeus puts on his mother's wedding dress and takes out the pearl-handled razor. It is vaguely implied that Arkham cannibalises his family's remains in a shamanic ritual.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkam Asylum:A Serious House on Serious Earth 15th Anniversary Edition'' ″This was originally a shamanic cannibal sequence, of which only vague hints, suggestions and shadowy threats remain″.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling in the blood of his family, he vows to bind the evil spirit of &quot;The Bat&quot;, which he believes inhabits the house, through ritual and sorcery. He treats Hawkins for months until finally electrocuting him in a [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] session. This incident is treated as an accident by the authorities. Soon after, Arkham freefalls into madness.  He continues his mission even after he is incarcerated in the Asylum himself; he scratches the words of the binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails until the day he dies.
 
Dr. Cavendish, another doctor in the asylum, believes he is a reincarnation of Amadeus and frees the inmates. Towards the end of the story he takes another doctor, Dr. Adams, hostage, dresses himself in the dress of Amadeus's mother, and relates Arkham's history to Batman before attempting to strangle Batman. Dr. Adams saves Batman by killing Cavendish with the same razor Amadeus used to kill his mother.

Amadeus's role in creating the asylum, Mad Dog's history with Amadeus, and Amadeus's murder of Mad Dog and descent into madness, have become canon, and are the origin of Arkham Asylum in all incarnations of the asylum since.

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Amadeus Arkham was shown to have been the partner of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jonah Hex]]. Amadeus was a psychologist who specializes in criminal behavior and lived in a mansion with his mother. Amadeus often partners up with Jonah Hex in an effort to solve a series of murders that were committed by the Gotham Ripper and even uncovered a child slavery operation run by Thurston Moody of the [[Court of Owls]].&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Western'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
The spirit of Dr. Amadeus Arkham was featured in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. The spirit of Arkham is unlocked by scanning several tablets scattered around Arkham, supposedly by Amadeus himself. They retell the story of Amadeus euthanizing his mother, the death of wife and daughter by Mad Dog, Mad Dog's death at the hands of Arkham's guards, and finally Amadeus' descent into madness. It is hinted (and later confirmed) that Warden [[Quincy Sharp]], who believes that he is Amadeus reincarnated, is responsible for the messages as evidenced by his attempts to kill [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and [[Harley Quinn]] being recorded onto the tablets. While there is no knowledge as to how he attempted to kill them, Sharp mentions his plans to [[Lobotomized|lobotomize]] Harley and attempt to kill Joker in his sleep, which is thwarted by the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]. If Batman scans all the tablets and comes back to the security office where he left Quincy Sharp, he will find in his place a final message telling Batman to continue his work. Amadeus' cell can also be found in the game, the entirety of its walls and floor covered with binding circles as in ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]''.

In the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', it is revealed that Sharp's delusions of being Arkham's reincarnation were the result of drugs and hypnotherapy delivered by [[Hugo Strange|Dr. Hugo Strange]] with the help of [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]. Scanning items related to certain inmates reveal that Sharp had treated the inmates abusively, notably by locking Mad Hatter in the physically lowest cell in the Asylum with the clear intent of him never getting out (whether he meant to kill him is unclear), and again trying to murder Poison Ivy by locking her in a cell and letting her die of her Titan overdose caused by the Joker only for a priest covered in pollen to give Ivy the needed ingredients from the pollen to heal herself. Listening to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate]] inmates shows that some of them are aware of Sharp's inhumane treatments towards his patients (having occasionally been victims themselves) as well as Sharp often murdering his patients.

'''Jeremiah Arkham''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character commonly appears in comic book titles associated with the superhero [[Batman (comics)|Batman]]. He is the director of [[Arkham Asylum]], and he is the nephew of [[Amadeus Arkham]], the Asylum's founder.

==Publication history==
He debuted in 1992 in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #1 during the four-part story arc &quot;[[Batman: The Last Arkham]]&quot; that kicked off the new series where he was created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Fictional character biography==

===Batman: The Last Arkham===
{{Main|Batman: The Last Arkham}}
In ''Batman: The Last Arkham,'' Jeremiah is portrayed as the somewhat sadistic administrator of Arkham Asylum who has delusions that the criminals he houses could one day be housed in society. The Asylum had come into Jeremiah's possession after his uncle [[Amadeus Arkham]] died after going mad. Jeremiah proceeded to demolish the asylum before rebuilding it with state-of-the-art systems to keep Arkham's criminals, such as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]] and [[Cornelius Stirk]], contained.

Jeremiah's background was touched upon briefly. Although not much is known about his prior history, the issue states that when he was a teenager he walked into a corner store being held up at gun point by an escaped inmate of the nearby Arkham Asylum, which was coincidentally run by his uncle. The gunman had already killed the storeowners, but when he went to shoot him, Jeremiah seemed to know all about the gunman's past and talked the gunman out of shooting him. The gunman then proceeded to commit suicide and Jeremiah knew he would be destined to succeed his uncle as the head of Arkham Asylum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadow of the Bat1&quot;&gt;[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat|Shadow of the Bat]] #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the new Arkham is built, [[Batman]] stumbles across a series of murders resembling [[Victor Zsasz|Zsasz]]'s [[Modus operandi|MO]]. Zsasz (who also debuted in Shadow of the Bat #1) had been an inmate at Arkham Asylum for a long period, but the similarity was too much to ignore, so Batman fakes insanity to get into the asylum to investigate. However, Jeremiah is unaware of this plot and takes Batman's insanity as genuine. Zsasz had actually been the murderer and had been getting out of Arkham by a series of underground tunnels put in place by the contractor on the asylum's revamp. Zsasz, upon hearing of Batman's arrival, predicts it's a set-up and begins to plant seeds of doubt and hatred towards Batman in Jeremiah Arkham's mind. In addition to this, Jeremiah blames Batman for stopping his inmate's rehabilitation. The situation erupts when Jeremiah locks Batman in a room and sets the inmates of Arkham on him, including [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], [[The Riddler]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadow of the Bat3&quot;&gt;[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat|Shadow of the Bat]] #3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the main storyline is wrapped up, and Zsasz uncovered, Batman questions whether Jeremiah is himself mad. Jeremiah denies it, but in the closing scene of the comic, he asks himself whether he will end up like his insane uncle and whether he is indeed mad as Batman suggested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadow of the Bat4&quot;&gt;[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat|Shadow of the Bat]] #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knightfall saga===
{{Main|Batman: Knightfall}}

Jeremiah Arkham returned once again during ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]].'' His role began when he was held at gunpoint by The Joker after Arkham Asylum is attacked by [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in order to free the asylum's inmates. The Joker attempts to scare Jeremiah into madness and Jeremiah is only saved when Batman frees him from the Joker's trap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman491&quot;&gt;''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #491&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Mask ===
After this story arc, Jeremiah Arkham has appeared occasionally throughout Batman storylines. During ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|Batman: No Man's Land]]'', he opened the Asylum gates, believing it was better for his patients to be at large in a mostly abandoned city than trapped in the Asylum with limited supplies. Most recently during the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', he envisions a plan to rebuild Arkham Asylum, after it was destroyed by himself (as the new [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]) following his capture and defeat by the new [[Dick Grayson|Batman]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #697 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Mask (Jeremiah Arkham).jpg|120px|thumb|right|Arkham as Black Mask, destroying his own asylum in ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1. Art by [[Tony Daniel]].]]

He also starred in the 3-issue follow up, ''Arkham Reborn,'' written by [[David Hine]] and drawn by [[Jeremy Haun]]. The story starts with Jeremiah returning to Arkham Asylum after it has been destroyed by the [[Black Glove]]. On his return he finds that some of the patients are still there, including his three 'special' subjects that no one knows about: No-Face, Mirror-Man and the Hamburger Lady. Once back in his office, Jeremiah finds his office a mess, spooky graffiti on the mirror and the journal of Amadeus Arkham (his Uncle) on his desk, though he thought he had burnt it. He finds his uncle's original plans for the asylum and decides it is an omen and thus starts to rebuild according to the plans.

The Asylum re-opens with the disgruntled blessing of the Gotham Shield Committee, consisting of Bruce Wayne (who was [[Hush (comics)|Thomas Elliot]] in disguise), D.A. Kate Spencer and [[Commissioner Gordon]]. He is also joined by Aaron Cash (head of Arkham security) and the new assistant director, Alyce Sinner.

As the Asylum gets more complete more accidents happen. The Raggedy Man is set loose, [[Clayface]] gets sick, [[Mr. Freeze|Mr. Freeze's]] room heats up and [[Killer Croc|Killer Croc's]] tank filtration breaks. As these events pass, Jeremiah becomes more stressed and unhinged, spending more time with his special patients.

Meanwhile, it is revealed that Alyce is having sexual relations with Black Mask. Once back at the asylum, she uses the computers to project the voice of Amadeus to the inmates and make them riot. Batman then intervenes and gets all the inmates back to their cells. Raggedy Man is found dead and Jeremiah is starting to fall apart. This is all part of the plan of Black Mask. Alyce reports back to him, apparently doing this for the money, and claims she also wants the asylum.
Jeremiah works out with Batman's help that Alyce is behind it all and she is committed. When he goes to talk to his special patients for some mental release he is confronted by a scary Jester figure (reminiscent of Joker). It is at this point he loses it. He is found by Batman and locked up with the other inmates in Arkham and Alyce is freed and made Director of the asylum.

In the end it turns out that his special patients were all a delusion and he also suffers with no recollection of when he is the Black Mask. He discovers this when Batman takes him to see the special three and after some intense moments Jeremiah attacks and &quot;kills&quot; them. Filled with remorse, Jeremiah is confronted with videotape of what had just occurred, courtesy of cameras hidden by a suspicious Cash.  The video shows only himself, talking and attacking hallucinations. He then completely breaks down and breaks the Jester staff which lets out a gas. Upon awakening, Jeremiah remembers everything - during his sessions with inmates [[Hugo Strange]] (a master of chemicals and psychology) and Joker, he had been given the Jester's staff, revealed to be coated in a chemical making the user very vulnerable to hypnotic suggestions. Strange and the Joker both manipulated Jeremiah, assaulting his weakened psyche: Strange encouraging an appetite for power and respect (resulting in the Black Mask personality), Joker encouraging his own style of insanity (manifesting as the Jester). Claiming to be back in control, Jeremiah is then put in intensive care.  Zsasz, who had threatened him earlier, comes to kill him and mark the scar inside his eyelid to remember him by. But by the time help arrives, Jeremiah has tied up Zsasz and delicately carved his initials there himself, proving the Black Mask is far from gone.

Jeremiah Arkham is locked up and left in the care of Alyce. He confesses to her that he is Black Mask and Zsasz is proof. She then kisses him and they embrace, Jeremiah pictured as the Black Mask.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Arkham Reborn'' graphic novel or Batman: Battle for the cowl: Arkham Asylum 1, Arkham Reborn 1-3, Detective comics 864-865  (2010) &lt;!-- ISBN? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It remains to be seen if Jeremiah's heavy exposure to the chemical in the staff merely made the Black Mask personality dominant, or if it has absorbed the others completely.

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a character resembling Jeremiah Arkham's incarnation of the Black Mask was seen early on during an Arkham Asylum Breakout in the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' storyline. However, Jeremiah Arkham was later seen in charge of Arkham Asylum instead of Alyce Sinner and not incarcerated within the building's cells. Despite this, his history as the Black Mask was still intact. He is seen congratulating Batman's decision on bringing the Joker to the asylum where he can receive &quot;treatment&quot; instead of dropping him off at a prison. Later during the Night of Owls event, Arkham is seen targeted by Talons as well as treating Roman Sionis, the first Black Mask. Sionis confirms Arkham's having been the Black Mask during Richard Grayson's time as Batman before Arkham is attacked by Talons. Arkham uses a Taser to fight off the Talons before being rescued by Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' Vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lord Asriel''' is a major character in [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy. Asriel is a member of the [[aristocracy]] in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] dominated by the Church. He is described as being &quot;a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seem to flash and glitter with savage laughter.&quot; Possessed of enormous determination and willpower, he is fierce in nature and commands great respect in both the political and academic spheres, being a military leader and a fellow of [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Jordan College|Jordan College]] in his world's version of the [[University of Oxford]].

==Naming==
''Asriel'' is one variant spelling of the [[Hebrew language|Hebraic]] name [[Azrael]], who, in the [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] tradition is mentioned in the counting of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0426.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Azrael]]&quot; is also traditionally believed to be the name of the Angel of Death in some sects of [[Islam]] and [[Sikhism]], as well as some [[Hebrew]] lore.&lt;ref name = &quot;DoA&quot;&gt;Davidson, Gustav (1967), ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_dictionary_of_angels.html?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels]'', Entry: '''Azrael''', pp. 64, 65, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, ISBN 9780029070505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/skh/granth/gr07.htm Shri Guru Granth Sahib, Section 07 - Raag Gauree - Part 165, &quot;''Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall crush them like sesame seeds in the oil-press.''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Daemon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]] is '''Stelmaria''', a [[snow leopard]]; her name is possibly a variant of ''Stella Maria'', a pseudo-[[Latin]] phrase that approximates &quot;star of the sea&quot; (see also [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Stella Maris]]). It could also derive from [[Italian language|Italian]], in which case it would mean &quot;Star Mary&quot;, which would raise associations with the [[Star of Bethlehem]] and the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. Whether these parallels have any significance is unknown.

==History within the novel==

Prior to the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel had been a highly respected member of the 'Brytish' aristocracy. He had been an explorer and did work in 'experimental theology', through which he acquired much power, land, and money. After having an affair with another politician's wife, [[Marisa Coulter]], that resulted in the birth of [[Lyra Belacqua|Lyra]], his life changed. Mrs Coulter's husband, Edward Coulter, attacked Lyra and her foster mother intending to harm and possibly murder Lyra. Lord Asriel intervened and killed Coulter. When the church found out, Asriel was tried and lost all property. Lyra was sent to a convent. Lord Asriel, who hated the church, arrived one day and took Lyra to his [[alma mater]], [[Locations in His Dark Materials|Jordan College]], where she was placed in the care of the [[His Dark Materials#Characters|Master]].

At the beginning of the trilogy, Lord Asriel visits Jordan College where he is almost poisoned by the Master. Asriel is saved by Lyra, who has secretly been watching the Master pour the poison into Lord Asriel's wine glass. Asriel is giving a Lecture to the Fellows of Jordan College hoping to raise money for an expedition. In the lecture he uses photograms of Dust and a city in the sky, as well as a severed head that he says is [[Stanislaus Grumman]]'s. He travels to [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Svalbard|Svalbard]] but is imprisoned and guarded by the bear warriors known as the [[panserbjørne]], led by [[Iofur Raknison]]. This action has been ordered by the General Oblation Board, which is headed by his ex-lover, Marisa Coulter. He receives hospitable treatment, and waits for a child on whom to perform intercision (a process to detach a child's dæmon that often results in the child's death). He is hoping to open a window in the aurora, in order to travel into a different universe. Eventually a child arrives, [[Roger Parslow]], unwittingly brought by Lyra.

Asriel enters [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Cittàgazze|Cittàgazze]] and, after a battle, allies himself with the rebel angels under [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Xaphania|Xaphania]]. He travels to an empty world and builds an enormous basalt fortress, gathering armies from many different worlds to start his rebellion against the Kingdom of Heaven. [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Ruta Skadi|Ruta Skadi]] finds him, and he tells her his plan, and gets her clan's support in the war.

Later, he has his allies, King Ogunwe and Lord Roke, find and rescue Lyra from Mrs Coulter. They capture Mrs Coulter, but Lyra and Will escape with two of Lord Roke's agents. Lord Asriel then attends to Mrs Coulter and tries to influence Lyra and Will, as they hold the key to renewing the Dust flow. Lord Asriel lets Mrs Coulter escape in an 'Intention Craft' and has Lord Roke follow her to gain information from the Consistorial Court of Discipline. They learn that the Church has made a bomb to kill Lyra, and Lord Asriel rescues Mrs Coulter just in time. He destroys Saint-Jean Les Eaux (the location of the bomb) with his Intention Craft.

Lyra survives, and Lord Asriel has his army search for her and Will's dæmons so the Authority's armies will be unable to control them. When Lord Asriel finds that the bomb has blown a hole under all the worlds into the [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], he devises a plan to defeat the Authority's powerful Regent, [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Metatron|Metatron]]. As his forces fight the armies of the Authority and the Church, Mrs Coulter tricks Metatron into trying to kill Lord Asriel and to take Lyra's dæmon. As they are standing on the edge of the abyss, Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter sacrifice themselves, falling into the abyss and taking Metatron with them. All three are condemned to fall through the abyss for eternity.

==Lyra and Marisa Coulter==

Marisa Coulter was Edward Coulter's young wife. Lyra, the product of an affair with Lord Asriel, was born when Marisa was just 21. Lyra resembled Asriel rather than Edward Coulter, so Mrs. Coulter gave her to Asriel, who placed their daughter with a gyptian woman, later revealed to be Ma Costa. When Mrs. Coulter's husband found out about the affair, he went in a rage to kill the baby Lyra. Lord Asriel fought and killed him. Asriel had his wealth and status taken away, and Lyra was placed at a convent. Asriel, outraged, took Lyra from the convent, and placed her at Jordan College, and ordered the Master to never allow Mrs Coulter to see or speak to Lyra in any way.  However, Marisa eventually turns up, intending to take Lyra north. Lyra agrees, but escapes when she discovers Mrs Coulter's intentions for the stolen children, as the head of the Oblation Board. When Lyra is kidnapped and taken to Bolvangar, Marisa races in to rescue her just as Lyra and Pantalaimon are about to be severed. In the film adaptation, she comforts Lyra and tells her she is her mother. Horrified, Lyra escapes once again, and this time she seeks out Lord Asriel to deliver the [[alethiometer]]. Unknowingly, Lyra leads her friend, Roger, to his death at the hands of Asriel. At this time Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel briefly meet.

Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter meet once again in Amber Spyglass, when Mrs Coulter is captured by Asriel's men. She and Asriel join forces to defeat Metatron, the powerful regent of the Authority, simply to give Lyra, their child, a chance to live. They die together in a chasm between worlds.

==Personality and appearance==

Lord Asriel is perhaps one of the best examples of a man who believes that the ends justify the means. Though he willingly sacrifices people, even children, to achieve his goal, he does not hesitate to give his own life in the course of achieving it. He acts not for selfish gain but to achieve a world which, in his eyes, is the best possible world for humanity.

He appears at first as a cold-hearted and seemingly unapproachable person, domineering to his servants and stern to his peers and niece. He shows little emotion, though several times throughout the story he displays sadness and regret for what is necessary, and in the end he shows his love for his child and his former lover, [[Marisa Coulter]], appearing particularly angry when he thinks that fate has brought him Lyra to use as his 'sacrifice' to bridge worlds (Although he calms down when Roger is revealed to also be available).

Asriel is an intimidating presence, both physically and intellectually; he appears equally adept at outmanoeuvring his adversaries using his considerable wits and academic knowledge as he is at achieving his objectives through brute strength. He is a tall, broad and powerful man, with Lyra noting that in rooms he has the air of a &quot;wild animal held in a cage too small for it&quot;. In the film adaption he has a beard, though no mention is made of it in the books. He is also mentioned to have lively, &quot;black&quot; eyes, glittering with &quot;savage laughter&quot;, indicating that beneath his cold and harsh appearance he is really a man with powerful emotions. As one of the characters remarks, he accomplishes things in his relatively short lifetime that some would not be able to do in hundreds of years.

==Stage and film adaptations==
[[Image:Lord Asriel.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Daniel Craig]] as Lord Asriel in the film ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]''.]]
From December 2003 to March 2004, London's [[Royal National Theatre]] staged an adaptation of ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' in which Lord Asriel was played by [[Timothy Dalton]].

[[Daniel Craig]] plays the role of Lord Asriel in the 2007 film adaptation ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' with [[Nicole Kidman]] joining him as Coulter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385752/ His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass (2007)] ''[[IMDb]]'' (Accessed 18 July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katherine Anne''' &quot;'''Kate'''&quot; '''Austen''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', played by [[Canada|Canadian]] actress [[Evangeline Lilly]]. Before the pilot was shot during the writing phase, [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) died when the group finds the cockpit and Kate was to emerge as the leader for the survivors, motivating them to build shelter and begin considering life as permanent residents of the island, however when it was decided he should survive, she was a second-in-command. In this original description for Kate, she was a slightly older woman separated from her husband, who went to the bathroom in the tail-section of the plane. However, that idea ended up being used for  [[Rose Henderson]] ([[L. Scott Caldwell]]) and her husband [[Bernard Nadler]] ([[Sam Anderson]]). Kate is involved in a [[love triangle]] with [[Jack Shephard|Jack]] and [[James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford|Sawyer]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) and is seen as very protective of [[Claire Littleton|Claire]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and her baby Aaron.

==Character biography==

===Prior to the crash===
Born in 1977 and raised in [[Iowa]], Kate is the daughter of diner worker Diane ([[Beth Broderick]]), and Sam ([[Lindsey Ginter]]), a [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|U.S. Army Ranger]] and [[Gulf War]] Veteran. At an early age Kate's parents divorced, and Diane married an abusive alcoholic named Wayne Janssen ([[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]]). As an adult, Kate killed Wayne, which she confessed to her mother before disappearing. Wayne had always been abusive to her mother, but Kate decided to kill him upon learning that he was her biological father. Diane called the authorities; thereafter Kate is pursued and ultimately arrested by [[Characters of Lost#Edward Mars|Edward Mars]] ([[Fredric Lehne]]).

Kate fled to [[Miami]] under the alias &quot;Monica&quot;, where she dated and soon married a police officer named Kevin Callis ([[Nathan Fillion]]). After a pregnancy scare and Kevin's purchase of two Oceanic tickets to [[Costa Rica]] for their honeymoon, Kate confessed her fugitive past and laced his drink with a sedative before disappearing.&lt;ref name = &quot;I Do&quot;/&gt; After months of traveling around the country under numerous aliases, Kate learned that Diane was dying of cancer, and decided to visit her. She reunited with her high-school sweetheart, Dr. Tom Brennan ([[Mackenzie Astin]]), who arranged a meeting between Kate and Diane. As Kate tried to apologize to her, Diane started screaming for help, prompting Kate to flee the hospital with Tom. A policeman opened fire on their getaway car, killing Tom and forcing Kate to flee the scene of the accident.&lt;ref name = &quot;Born To Run&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Born To Run | episodelink = Born To Run (Lost) | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Tucker Gates]] (director); [[Javier Grillo-Marxuach]] (story), [[Edward Kitsis]] &amp; [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]] (teleplay) | network = ABC | airdate = 2005-05-11 | season = 1 | number = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Months later Kate staged a robbery in [[New Mexico]] with several criminals to infiltrate a bank's [[safe deposit box]].Tom's toy airplane was being stored in box 815, the same number as the crashed flight number. She fled to [[Australia]] where, while sleeping in a barn, she was discovered by a farmer, Ray Mullens ([[Nick Tate]]). Posing as a Canadian hiker, Kate worked on the farm for three months. When the farmer caught her attempting to sneak away, he offered her a ride into town the next morning. During the journey however, Kate discovered that the farmer had found out her true identity and notified Edward Mars of her whereabouts. Kate grabbed the wheel and crashed the truck into a field but instead of running, she helped the unconscious farmer from his vehicle, giving Mars time to pursue and arrest her. Escorting her to the airport in handcuffs, Mars briefed local security officers on Kate's fugitive past and revealed his locked carry-on case containing four firearms (and a fifth in an ankle holster). As the plane was bombarded with escalating turbulence, Mars was knocked unconscious by luggage from the overhead compartment. Kate stole the keys to the handcuffs and attached an oxygen mask to Mars and for herself, as the plane splintered and crashed onto the island.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Tabula Rasa | episodelink = Tabula Rasa (Lost) | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Jack Bender]] (director); [[Damon Lindelof]] (writer) | network = ABC | airdate = 2004-10-06 | season = 1 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the crash===

====Season 1====
Having survived the crash, [[Jack Shephard]] noticed Kate walking out of the jungle and asked her to stitch his wound, to which she agreed reluctantly. During their second day on the Island - Jack, Kate and [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) went to retrieve the cockpit's transceiver from the plane debris. They tried to rescue the injured Pilot, but the Smoke Monster attacked them. When they returned; Kate, [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]) and several other survivors hiked to higher ground of the Island to transmit a distress signal on the transceiver.

Back at the camp, Kate visited the injured Marshal where he attempted to strangle her. Kate told Jack that he should euthanize the dying man, but Jack questioned her true motives when he learned about her criminal record. She went on a mission to triangulate the distress signal, and helped an injured Michael Dawson back to the camp. Jack suggested that the survivors move to the caves that he had discovered, but Kate refused because she was afraid of &quot;digging in&quot; and settling down.  

When Kate discovered the Marshal's case; she and Sawyer had several fights to gain it in their possession. Eventually - Kate asked Jack for his help; he retrieved the case and decided that he should open it with Kate. Inside the case was Tom's toy plane. Jack questioned her about the toy, and she admitted the plane belonged to the man that she loved and killed.

Maintaining a helpful attitude; Kate - along with Jack - attempted to track down [[Claire Littleton|Claire]] and Charlie when they were kidnapped by Ethan. They were able to find and revive a hanging Charlie; and later, she helped to capture Ethan. Kate was forced to deliver Claire's baby by herself when Jack was trying to save [[Boone Carlyle|Boone's]] life.

Kate tried to gain a place on Michael's raft by attempting to steal Sawyer and Jin's places. She convinced Jin's wife, Sun to poison his water to ensure that he would not be able to travel on the raft. In preparation for the trip, Kate stole a dead woman's passport to assume her identity. However - Michael accused Sawyer of Michael's poisoning, which led to Sawyer revealing her fugitive status to the other survivors.

After [[Danielle Rousseau|Rousseau]] arrived on the beach to warn the camp of the Others' imminent arrival; she directed Kate, Jack, Locke, and [[Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes|Hurley]] to the Black Rock - where they attempted to carry dynamite to the hatch that was  discovered in the jungle.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EggtownScreen.png|thumb|right|250px|Kate goes on trial for murder.]] --&gt;In &quot;[[Eggtown]]&quot;, Kate goes on trial for her father's murder.   Jack testifies on her behalf as a character witness.  He lies under oath and tells the court that it was Kate that saved him and the other survivors.  Under cross-examination, he is asked whether he loves the defendant and he replies &quot;Not anymore.&quot;  Kate looks crestfallen and demands that Jack's testimony cease.  Kate's mother, the prosecution's star witness, tries to reconcile with Kate, and then decides not to testify.  She is consequently released on ten years probation, provided that she does not leave California. &lt;ref name=&quot;Eggtown&quot;/&gt; Kate meets ups with Jack after she is released and he confesses to her that he lied on the stand (about no longer loving her) and Kate is delighted.  She invites him to come home with her, but he hesitates because he is not ready to see Aaron (his nephew) again.  In &quot;[[Something Nice Back Home]]&quot;, Kate is seen living in an established relationship with Jack, who is also acting as a surrogate father for his nephew [[Aaron Littleton|Aaron]]. Later, Jack asks Kate to marry him, which she happily accepts. Jack later confronts Kate about her &quot;errands&quot;, which involved her meeting with Sawyer's daughter; Clementine and his ex-girlfriend Cassidy. Kate refuses to tell Jack any details about this, as she knows Sawyer would not want anybody else to know. Jack is angered by her secrecy and raises his voice, waking Aaron up. Kate rushes to comfort him then Jack leaves, paranoid, ending their relationship.&lt;ref name = &quot;Something Nice Back Home&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Something Nice Back Home | episodelink = Something Nice Back Home | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Stephen Williams (director)|Stephen Williams]] (director); [[Edward Kitsis]] &amp; [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]] (writers) | network = ABC | airdate = 2008-05-01 | season = 4 | number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 5====
Kate is surprisingly confronted by Dan Norton, a lawyer who is asking for a blood sample from both her and Aaron to determine their biological relationship. Norton refuses to tell Kate who his client is, and Kate denies giving him a blood sample. Kate visits Sun, who convinces her to go see Norton and try to get him to reveal who his client is. Kate leaves Aaron in Sun's care while visiting Norton's firm, but cannot get a name out of him. Kate and Jack follow Norton to his clients house, who turns out to be Claire's mother. Jack goes in to talk to her and then realizes that she isn't the client they were looking for. When approached by Ben later, Kate discovers that he was the one who was trying to get a blood sample from her.

Kate realizes that she is not supposed to raise Aaron and leaves him in the care of Claire's mother.  She goes to Jack's apartment and they spend the night together.  She returns to the island with the other survivors on flight 316.  Sawyer explains that the year is 1977 and secretly gets her, Jack and Hurley to join the Dharma Initiative. Sayid shoots a young Ben Linus and Kate and Sawyer save his life by bringing him to Richard Alpert. After refusing to aid Jack in his plans to detonate the hydrogen bomb, Kate returns to the Dharma Initiative, to then be put on the Dharma sub with Sawyer and Juliet. However, she insists that the three leave the submarine to prevent Jack from detonating the bomb. When the three return to the island, they eventually reunite with Jack, Jin, Sayid and Hurley. Although Sawyer tries to persuade Jack not to use the bomb, his efforts are in vain and they fight. Kate tells Jack that if he really believes that detonating the bomb is the best thing, then she will help him, while Sawyer reluctantly agrees to go along with the plan after Juliet also takes Jack's side. Kate assists Jack in getting the bomb to the required location, but when he drops it down a tunnel, it does not go off, despite the fact that it is supposed to explode on impact. Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Juliet are shocked, but immediately, the Dharma drill that had been drilling deep into the pocket of magnetic energy that Jack was trying to contain went too far, and Juliet is ultimately dragged down the tunnel, into the source of the energy. Kate and Sawyer try to get her out but the strength of the magnetism is too much and she is pulled into the tunnel. Kate attempts to remove a distressed Sawyer from the scene along with Jack, but little do they know that Juliet remains conscious for now and desperately attempts to detonate the bomb, eventually succeeding.

====Season 6====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:What Kate Does.png|thumb|left|250px|Kate is confronted by Sawyer.]] --&gt;
Kate continues her mission to reunite Claire with Aaron. When she eventually finds her, she discovers that a dark side has grown in Claire, who has become unstable due to many years of living alone, in the belief that the others are holding her son hostage in a Temple. Sawyer escapes from the Temple and Kate follows him to apologize for the loss of Juliet and to ask him to help her find Claire. Sawyer assures Kate she is not to blame, and reveals his intention to propose to Juliet. Kate breaks down, and ultimately returns to the Temple to get Claire. When Kate joins the Man in Black's camp, after Claire learns that it was Kate who took Aaron and attempts to murder Kate by throwing her to the ground and pulling a knife on her. Kate is saved by 'Locke' and seeing that Kate is upset by the loss of Claire's friendship, warns her that Claire should not be reunited with Aaron as she is now 'crazy'. Claire later tearfully apologises for her actions and thanks Kate for keeping her son safe.

When Kate, (who has since grouped up with 'Locke') they all plan a breakout from the Man in Black's party, Kate wants to bring Claire but Sawyer refuses, saying she is no longer the friend they once knew following her attack on Kate. When Claire sees them leaving her behind again she gives chase and holds them at gunpoint just as they attempt to board a boat to escape. Kate talks Claire around, convincing her to come with them so she can finally go home to her son.

The group try to leave on Widmore's sub, and Kate is shot through the right collarbone. Once on board, while Jack is tending to Kate's wound, they discover that the Man in Black has placed a C4 explosive on board. Sawyer inadvertently causes the timer to count down faster and Sayid, Jin and Sun are killed in the resulting explosion. Jack asks Hurley to take care of Kate and make sure that he takes her to safety off the sinking vessel.  On the shore, Kate races over to Jack and is relieved to find him safe.  Kate, Jack and Hurley mourn the loss of their friends while Sawyer remains unconscious. 

As the Man in Black starts to destroy the Island, Kate helps Jack kill him by shooting him. Jack is wounded in the fight with 'Locke' and he and Kate part for the final time due to their different destinies. Jack and Kate share a passionate kiss and declare their love for each other one last time before Jack leaves with Hurley to save the Island, and Kate goes to fulfill her promise to find Claire before departing  on the Ajira plane, piloted by Frank. Along the way, they find Claire, who is scared to leave the island as she feels she is no longer a fit mother. Kate convinces her that her worries are normal and promises to help her. Kate escapes the island on the plane with Claire, Sawyer, Miles, Frank and Richard - Kate hand in hand with Claire.

In the Sideways, Kate remembers her life when she helps deliver Aaron at the concert.  Kate waits at the concert so she can reunite with Jack.  She finds him and tells him &quot;I've missed you so much&quot;, a reference that she probably lived a long life after leaving the Island and missed Jack profoundly.  Jack eventually awakens and remembers Kate and his friends.  Together with Jack at her side, they move on together.

==Development==
Around 75 women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate, including [[Yunjin Kim]], who later played the role of [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]]. In the initial plans, Jack was going to die midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge as the leader. She was not going to be a fugitive, instead her husband was going to go to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose’s character. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to work in the United States. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;&gt;&quot;Before They Were Lost&quot;.

'''''Azazeal''''' (pronounced &quot;ahz-azeel&quot;) is a [[fictional character]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television series]] ''[[Hex (TV series)|Hex]]'', played by [[Michael Fassbender]].

The character is seemingly based on the similarly spelled [[Azazel]] from [[The Book of Enoch]]. However, past the name, the similarities end. In biblical [[Apocrypha]], the [[fallen angel]]s referred to in ''Hex'' as the [[Nephilim]] were in fact called the [[Grigori]], or &quot;Watchers.&quot; In the Apocrypha, the Nephilim were offspring of the Grigori by mortal women. It is most likely the difference in spelling of Azazeal/Azazel and the change to Nephilim from Grigori were done for aesthetic reasons, though this has not been officially confirmed.

Azazeal seduced a series of women throughout the ages, dating from ancient [[Egypt]] to the present, but these women were usually killed by [[Ella Dee]] in order to stop the freedom of the Nephilim that his son's birth would signal.

In the second episode of ''Hex'', Azazeal sacrifices Cassie Hughes' friend and roommate [[Thelma Bates]], turning her into a [[ghost]] and releasing his power. Later in the series, he enters into a sexual relationship with Cassie and Cassie's teacher Jo, eventually turning her to his side. Through a series of demonic possessions, he conceives an heir, Malachi, with Cassie, and convinces the abortionist to put the child in his care at [[Christmas]] time.

In series two, after Cassie's death, Azazeal uses the mystical Stone of [[Belial]] to make Ella Dee relive her torture and execution, eventually causing her to lose her immortality and rapidly age to 500 or so years old, nearing death. He, an adult Malachi and Perie the &quot;fairy&quot; form a small alliance, before Azazeal is suddenly notified by higher powers that he is no longer to be Malachi's caregiver, replaced with [[Mephistopheles]]. He and Ella share a goodbye without trying to kill each other.

'''Azazel''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], in particular those featuring the [[X-Men]]. A [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the power of [[teleportation]], he is the father of the X-Men's [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #428, during &quot;The Draco&quot; storyline, written by [[Chuck Austen]]. The character's name comes from [[Azazel]], an angel from the Book of Enoch mentioned first at chapter 8 verse 1.

==Fictional character biography==
Azazel claims that many years ago an ancient horde of demonic humanoid [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s from biblical times called the Neyaphem were in an epic battle with a group of [[angel]]ic xenophobic mutants, named the Cheyarafim. The Cheyarafim were victorious in the battle and banished the &quot;demons&quot; to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his [[teleportation]] powers. His only hope to return to Earth was by impregnating women because his children are linked to his dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #433&lt;/ref&gt;

Azazel began mating with women who had unusual characteristics, at least with looks and abilities other women did not have, as successfully birthing a Neyaphem takes a great physical strain. He met [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] in [[Germany]], at the time she was married to a rich baron named Christian Wagner, who was unable to give her children. When Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner, she had an instant attraction to him. Although she was hesitant to betray Christian, she gave in to Azazel and became pregnant with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. While Mystique had actually fallen in love with Azazel, he seemed only to be interested in impregnating her, though in truth, he found himself in love with her as well, making her the only woman he ever truly loved. Shortly after his &quot;mission&quot; was complete, Azazel left Mystique because the Cheyarafim had learned of his location in Germany, thus would attempt to kill Azazel, Mystique, and their unborn child. Knowing that Mystique would be safe - having her resources and being the woman she was - Azazel left her to protect her and their child.

Soon afterward, Mystique killed Christian and buried him because he suspected her betrayal. A few months later, Mystique gave birth to Nightcrawler. Due to the shock and the strain of the boy’s difficult delivery, Mystique lost concentration and accidentally revealed her true form. Considered a demon, Mystique was chased away by an angry mob. Barely escaping, she took the form of a townsperson and, acquiescing to the mob, tossed the baby down a ravine.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Unlimited'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; The child was teleported away, apparently by Azazel, and given into Margali Szardos’ care.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #428&lt;/ref&gt;

Azazel eventually returns to Earth thanks to [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]]'s former ally Carcabria (a witch of The Winding Way that is affiliated with Margali Szardos).&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #23&lt;/ref&gt; Azazel and his Azazel-like Bamfs side with Kade Killgore and the Hellfire Club where he works at the Hellfire Academy. Azazel also claimed that he took over Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #30&lt;/ref&gt; In the depths of Hell, he encounters thousands of worm-like parasites whom he feeds with his blood and thus reforms them as [[Bamf]]s in his own image.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using his Bamf army and his link with Nightcrawler, who died in the meantime, Azazel begins invading the domains of afterlife - [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], and [[Purgatory]] - to gather souls and thus boost his power to divine proportions. However, Nightcrawler strikes a deal with some of the Bamfs and, with the additional aid of his fellow X-Men, draws Azazel from the afterlife and binds him to Earth, sacrificing his soul in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; But as Azazel is sent to Rykers Island in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody, Mystique frees him, despite Nightcrawler's attempts to stop her.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Azazel possesses all of his son Nightcrawler's powers, but to a much greater degree; has unparalleled teleportation powers and does not suffer from the limits of needing to see or know where he is going.

Azazel also seems to have studied swordsmanship to such a degree that he has become extremely skilled with bladed weapons. He has also studied many academic fields.

Azazel displays a number of super-human abilities during his appearances; these include:

* Immortality: He does not age at all, and can apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries.
* Teleportation: able to transport himself, his clothing, and additional mass across inter-dimensional distances.
* Paralyzation: ability to generate bolts of paralyzing energy.
* Metamorph: can disguise his appearance through unknown means.
* Will Bending: ability to manipulate minds, giving him influence over others.

===Weaknesses===
Azazel could only spend limited time on Earth without the assistance of his children, but currently due to Nightcrawler's interference he is bound to Earth. He and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to break down. He has knowledge of a way to reverse the curse.

==Other versions==
In the &quot;[[Age of Apocalypse]]&quot; reality, Azazel first appears as a member of the Clan Akkaba.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Apocalypse'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Weapon Omega appointed Azazel his Minister of Death and made him his right-hand man.

In the patchwork planet known as [[Battleworld]] that debuted in ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', a zombified version of Azazel is shown to exist in the Deadlands, a Battleworld domain outside God Emperor Doom's jurisdiction that represents the remnants of [[Marvel Zombies|Earth-2149]] and goes by the name of Red Terror.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies'' Vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, he displays incredible teleporting abilities, similar to that displayed by Nightcrawler in the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' but ranging over a much greater distance, and hand-to-hand combat skills, assisted by a short sword and a sharp tail on which he impales his victims. He also is of Russian origin, speaking in a Russian accent and at times using Russian phrases, such as &quot;nyet&quot; and &quot;comrade&quot;.

'''Robert''' &quot;'''Bobby Bacala'''&quot; '''Baccalieri, Jr.''', played by [[Steve Schirripa]], is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. A mobster, he is first shown as one of the soldiers and then later top aides to [[Junior Soprano|Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano]]. Throughout the series, he rises through the ranks of the organized crime organization, becoming a [[caporegime|capo]], as well as  [[Tony Soprano]]'s brother-in-law. Toward the end of the series, Bobby becomes an [[underboss]] to Tony.

==Biography==

Bobby, unlike many of his fellow wiseguys, was big-hearted and quite shy. He ran Junior Soprano's old loan shark business.  Although not officially a captain until much later, Bobby was a high-ranking soldier who ran Junior Soprano's old crew and reported directly to Junior, and later to Tony.  Before his death, he was thought to be being groomed for the job of boss, if Tony were to be killed or arrested. Bobby was the son of [[Bobby Baccalieri, Sr.]], a highly respected mobster (whom Tony referred to as &quot;a real terminator&quot;), who fronted as a barber. Bobby's father returned from retirement for one last job before his death from lung cancer (he actually died in a car accident right after the successful hit, losing control of his vehicle during a cancer-induced coughing fit), which Bobby found quite distressing. Before joining [[Junior Soprano]]'s crew Bobby was a head waiter until at least 1986 and was groomed by his father, Bobby Sr. At some point, Bobby became a made man, although without making his bones (committing murder). Bobby was married to [[List of characters from The Sopranos - friends and family#Karen Baccalieri|Karen Baccalieri]] until her death in a car crash and they had two children, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - friends and family#Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Baccalieri III|Bobby III]] and [[List of characters from The Sopranos - friends and family#Sophia Baccalieri|Sophia]].

Bobby was quite different from the other men in the Soprano crime family. He was quiet, almost shy, kind-hearted and even-tempered; these traits made him well liked, if not necessarily respected.  He was obese, which brought him much ridicule, but he was very loyal and even Tony apologized to him after making cracks about his weight. In turn, Bobby was always respectful, and sometimes affectionate, towards Tony, telling him, &quot;I always liked you&quot;, in the aftermath of a feud that saw Tony order the deaths of several members of Junior Soprano's crew that Bobby was in. He bore no lasting grudges against [[Paulie Gualtieri]] or [[Christopher Moltisanti]], who carried out these hits, and appeared briefly looking delighted on the day Christopher became a made man.

Bobby operated Junior Soprano's [[loan shark]] business in his stead and acted as Junior's assistant while Junior was under house arrest on federal [[racketeering]] charges. Junior eventually rewarded him by putting Bobby in charge of his loan shark operation during the later part of his prosecution. Bobby was made acting capo when Junior had [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Murf Lupo|Murf Lupo]] step down in &quot;[[For All Debts Public and Private]]&quot;.

Bobby was very loyal to his wife, Karen, and (as revealed in &quot;[[Christopher (The Sopranos)|Christopher]]&quot;) was the only made man in the Soprano crew without a [[mistress (lover)|comare]]. The only time he was ever seen with another woman other than his wife was in the episode &quot;[[University (The Sopranos)|University]].&quot; When Ralphie walks back into the [[Bada Bing]] after beating Tracee to death, Bobby could be seen talking to another stripper. However, Bobby lost his wife in a car accident and took it especially hard. Following Karen's death, [[Janice Soprano]], along with many other women, actively pursued Bobby, trying to help him out as much as possible (with cooking and watching over Bobby's two children) but also trying to initiate a relationship with him.

When his grief continued, Janice went so far as to use the [[internet]] to expose his children to a [[Ouija]] board within their house. This frightened them and cleared a path for Janice to demonstrate that Bobby's grief was affecting his children. Despite Bobby's initial reluctance, the two were soon married and he soon fathered a daughter, [[List of characters from The Sopranos – friends and family#Domenica &quot;Nica&quot; Baccalieri|Domenica]]. Bobby remained unaware of his wife's machinations at the start of their relationship. Bobby also enjoyed playing with [[Rail transport modeling|model trains]].

Since 2001, when he assisted Tony in rescuing [[Christopher Moltisanti]] and [[Paulie Gualtieri]] from the Pine Barrens (in the [[Pine Barrens (The Sopranos)|eponymous episode]]), Bobby had grown closer to Tony. Additionally, as [[Ralph Cifaretto]] put it, &quot;Dating the boss's sister will help a made man's career&quot;; nevertheless, Tony had recently stepped up his expectations of Bobby, who he felt was taking their newfound family relationship as an excuse not to earn at a competitive level, compared to other members of the family. Bobby rose to the occasion by supplementing his income with $7,000 he received for using his skills as a [[marksman]] to shoot a rapper he met at the hospital, while Tony was in the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]], in order to raise the rapper's profile.

In the Season Six episode, &quot;[[The Ride (The Sopranos episode)|The Ride]]&quot; Bobby's wife, son and youngest daughter were involved in a ride accident at the feast of St. Elzear, while he took his other daughter to the bathroom. Bobby's initial reaction was relief that his family was unhurt. However, at a Sunday dinner at the Soprano residence, Janice berated Bobby for not standing up for them. She later accompanied him when he paid a visit to the ride's owner. Bobby stormed into his motel room, beat him up and tried to extort money from him but learned that Paulie Gualtieri had been responsible for withholding the funds needed to repair the ride. Bobby tracked Paulie down at the festival and angrily confronted him; the two were separated by other associates in the crime family. At Christopher's belated [[bachelor party]], Bobby left soon after Paulie arrived. Tony ordered Paulie to make things right with Bobby. The episode demonstrated Bobby's devotion to his family, but also confirmed his credentials as a man not to be crossed lightly, further cementing his position in the higher echelons of Tony's crew.

In the Season Six episode, &quot;[[Moe N' Joe (The Sopranos episode)|Moe N' Joe]]&quot;, Bobby was beaten and robbed by a street gang as he was making his collections.  One of the gang members fired a shot at the sidewalk near Bacala's face and a concrete fragment injured his right eye.  The injury left his sight in the eye uncertain. Despite the injury, Bobby made certain his payments reached Tony, by way of a concerned [[Carlo Gervasi]], who visited Bobby at the hospital.

Bobby's injury prompted Tony to reassess his relationship with his sister and brother-in-law. Tony's feelings of guilt prompted him to broker an agreement with [[Johnny Sack]] that allowed Bobby and his family to buy Sack's house at half price.

In the Season Six Episode, &quot;[[Soprano Home Movies]]&quot;, during a ''[[Monopoly]]'' game with Bobby, Carmela, and Janice, Tony began to make rude remarks towards Janice in reference to her promiscuous behavior as a younger woman, which Bobby took as a disrespectful affront. Unexpectedly, a usually meek and passive Bobby launched his fist into Tony's face, knocking him to the floor. Bobby won the fight, battering the inebriated Tony quite severely but also injuring his boss's pride. Tony, although reasonably gracious in defeat, was embarrassed at having been defeated in a brawl (especially by Bobby of all people) and frequently asserted to Bobby, Janice, and Carmela that he would have won the fight had he not slipped on the rug nor undergone such physical impotence after being shot by [[Uncle Junior]]. As a partial result of this awkward incident, Bobby was tasked with murdering the brother-in-law of one of Tony's [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] associates, an important hit that formed part of a deal to save money on a pharmaceuticals racket. It was Bobby's first murder; Tony mentioned earlier that Bobby had never &quot;popped his cherry&quot; with [[wetwork]] though Bobby was quite remorseful after committing the hit.

Bobby's attitude was also affected by Tony's plan to promote him to Acting Boss. Tony wanted to bring Bobby up into the administration of the organization, because his earlier plan of positioning [[Christopher Moltisanti]] as his emissary and eventual heir had failed, following their personal falling out. While Paulie Walnuts nominally held the title of Underboss, Bacala attended high-level meetings and sit-downs alongside Tony and Silvio, identifying him as a high-ranking capo.  Even though Bobby was just a capo at the time, he was still consulted in strategy sessions, such as when Tony consulted Bobby about what to do about [[Phil Leotardo]]'s attempts to displace him as boss of the family. A few years earlier, Tony would have never brought Bobby into such a high-level discussion. And unlike Moltisanti, Bobby neither took Tony's trust for granted nor his new position lightly.  Conscious of his abrupt rise from low level soldier to top Capo, and 'de facto' underboss, Bobby actually worked hard to keep Tony's trust and respect, rather than simply coasting on his goodwill as Moltisanti had, and his loyalty and work ethic did not go unnoticed or unappreciated by Tony.

Bobby's rise and work ethic did not go unnoticed by the other families, either. When his name was brought up at meeting of top New York associates and one of them mocked his rise by noting he'd originally been Junior Soprano's driver, [[Butch DeConcini]] defended Bobby, noting that almost all ''mafiosi'' started doing work considered low-level or menial.

When war erupted between the New Jersey and New York families in the episode &quot;[[The Blue Comet]]&quot;, New York boss [[Phil Leotardo]] ordered the deaths of the DiMeo family's top three &quot;guys&quot;: Bacala, [[Silvio Dante]], and [[Tony Soprano]].  FBI agent [[Dwight Harris]] informed Tony at [[Satriale's Pork Store|Satriale]]'s that a snitch in Brooklyn had implied that Phil had ordered a major hit on the New Jersey crew. Tony then gave orders to inform everyone of the upcoming assassination plot. Bobby left his cell phone behind as he entered a hobby shop, preventing him from receiving the warning call. While Bobby was looking at a vintage [[Blue Comet]] train set, two men entered the store and opened fire. Multiple gunshots sent Bobby's riddled body crashing on top of a model train display. Later in the episode, when a saddened Tony reflects on Bobby's death, while holding the assault rifle that Bobby gave him on his birthday, Tony flashes back to the moment when he and Bobby were fishing, contemplating their own fates. Bobby observes that when getting killed, you &quot;probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?&quot; With Janice now a widow, she asks Uncle Junior for money, now living in state care but the attempt fails as Junior's advancing dementia has made him forget where his secret funds are hidden. Tony, although estranged from Junior, later visits his uncle and firmly tells him that if he does recall where his money is, that the money go straight to Bobby's children, with Tony overseeing it.

'''Petyr Baelish''', nicknamed '''Littlefinger''', is a [[fictional character]] created by American author [[George R. R. Martin]]. He is a prominent non-[[Narrative mode#Third-person view|point of view]] character in Martin's award-winning ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, and a main character in [[HBO]]'s adaptation of the series, ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', where he is portrayed by [[Aidan Gillen]]. In ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', it is revealed that several major plot points have hinged on Baelish's intrigues, including the framing of [[Tyrion Lannister]] for the attempt on [[Bran Stark]]'s life, the downfall of Lord [[Ned Stark|Eddard Stark]], the deaths of Lord [[Jon Arryn]] and King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], and the [[War of the Five Kings]].

==Character==

=== Background ===
Petyr descends from a Braavosi sellsword who served House Corbray. His father befriended Lord Hoster Tully during the War of the Ninepenny Kings, and Tully took the young Petyr as a [[ward (law)|ward]]. Petyr grew up at House Tully's castle [[Riverrun (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Riverrun]] with Hoster's daughters [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] and his son Edmure, the latter of whom gave Petyr the nickname &quot;Littlefinger&quot; as a reference to his short stature and his family's lands on the smallest of the Fingers. He was a sly, mischievous child with the ability to always look contrite after his mischief.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_18 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18, Catelyn IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became infatuated with Catelyn and claims to have lost his virginity to her while drunk; in reality, he lost it to Lysa, who was herself obsessed with him. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark ([[Ned Stark|Eddard Stark]]'s elder brother), Petyr brazenly challenged him to a [[duel]] for her hand in marriage but lost easily to Brandon. His life was spared at the behest of Catelyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 40&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_40 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 40, Catelyn VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his convalescence, he impregnated Lysa but the [[pregnancy]] ended in a forced [[abortion]] and Petyr was banished from Riverrun.

Even after her marriage to Jon Arryn, Lysa remained in love with Petyr. Her patronage saw Baelish appointed as customs officer at Gulltown, a position he excelled at. Arryn, who was Hand to King Robert Baratheon, eventually brought Baelish to King's Landing as Master of Coin. When Arryn tries to have his and Lysa's son Robert sent to Dragonstone to be fostered by Stannis Baratheon, Baelish gives Lysa poison to kill Jon and convinces her to tell Catelyn that House Lannister was responsible. This subterfuge sets in motion the main events of the series.

=== Appearance and personality ===
Petyr Baelish is a small man, shorter than Catelyn Stark.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;/&gt; He is slender and quick with sharp features and laughing gray-green eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;/&gt; He has a pointed chin beard and threads of silver in his hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;/&gt;  He often wears a silver mockingbird to fasten his cloak.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;/&gt; He clearly enjoys the intrigues of court life at King's Landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 20&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_20 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 20, Eddard IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is dangerously intelligent&lt;ref name=&quot;A Clash of Kings: Chapter 15&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_15 | title=A Clash of Kings: Chapter 15, Tyrion III}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cunning enough to hide his machinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 32&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_32 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 32, Arya III}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Petyr is not a POV character his motivations are somewhat of a mystery. However, his methods have been totally ruthless, including lies, treachery, and murder to achieve his goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 61&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_61 | title=A Storm of Swords: Chapter 80, Sansa V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 80&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_80 | title=A Storm of Swords: Chapter 80, Sansa VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==

===Book series===

====A Game of Thrones====
Baelish hides Catelyn at one of his [[brothel]]s when she brings the news of the attempt on [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s life, and tells her the [[dagger]] used was won from him by Tyrion Lannister.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 18&quot;/&gt; This leads to Catelyn's capture of Tyrion; but this information is later identified as a lie.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 31&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_31 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 31, Tyrion IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petyr helps Eddard expose the secret parentage of the royal children,&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 25&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_25 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 25, Eddard V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 33&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_33 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 33, Eddard VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 35&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_35 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 35, Eddard IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; but advises him to abet Joffrey's rise to power in order to consolidate their own. Ned insists that Stannis must be king and asks Baelish to secure the help of the City Watch when he moves against the Lannisters, but Petyr betrays Lord Stark&lt;ref name=&quot;A Game of Thrones: Chapter 49&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_49 | title=A Game of Thrones: Chapter 49, Eddard XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aids his arrest.

====A Clash of Kings====
After the death of [[Renly Baratheon]], Petyr arranges an alliance between the Lannisters and the powerful [[House Tyrell]], which leads to [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s defeat. When Joffrey is convinced to marry Renly's widow, [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], in ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', Petyr is named Lord of [[Harrenhal]] and [[Lord Paramount]] of the Trident in place of [[Edmure Tully]].

====A Storm of Swords====
Baelish is given charge to marry Lysa Arryn and bring the Vale under the control of the Lannisters;&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 19&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_19 | title=A Storm of Swords: Chapter 19, Tyrion III}}&lt;/ref&gt; before departing he reveals [[Olenna Tyrell]]'s plan to marry Sansa to [[Willas Tyrell]],&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 19&quot;/&gt; leading to Sansa's forced marriage to Tyrion. When Joffrey is poisoned at his wedding feast, Petyr has Sansa taken from King's Landing in the confusion and takes her to his holdings on The Fingers disguised as his illegitimate daughter.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 61&quot;/&gt; During the voyage, Petyr reveals that he had conspired with Olenna Tyrell to poison Joffrey and blame Tyrion for the murder. Lysa arrives at Petyr's keep and the two are promptly married at Lysa's insistence, though Petyr would prefer a court wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 68&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_68 | title=A Storm of Swords: Chapter 68, Sansa VI}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the wedding Baelish and Sansa travel to [[the Eyrie]], where he spends much of the time asserting his new authority over the lords of the Vale. While alone with Sansa, he notes her physical similarity to Catelyn and kisses Sansa. Witnessing the encounter, Lysa tries to kill Sansa a short time later. Petyr rushes to comfort Lysa, but reveals that he had only ever loved Catelyn and pushes Lysa to her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 80&quot;/&gt; He immediately implicates the only other witness, the [[minstrel]] Marillion.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Storm of Swords: Chapter 80&quot;/&gt;

====A Feast for Crows====
Petyr names himself Lord Protector and claims Lysa's son [[Robert Arryn|Robert]] as his ward. The Lords of the Vale try to claim Robert, but Petyr bribes Lyn Corbray to help Petyr obtain leverage to keep Robert. Petyr later reveals to Sansa that he plans to either eliminate the lords or win them to his side, and to help Sansa regain [[The North (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the North]]. He also tells her that he has arranged for her to marry Robert Arryn's cousin and heir, Harrold Hardyng, and that on Robert's death she will reveal herself and use the Knights of the Vale to recover the North.

===Television series===
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Arryn blue scroll.png|right|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a white falcon flying out of a white moon on a sky blue field|Coat of arms of House Arryn]]
Baelish's storyline remains much the same as in the books for the first few seasons of the television series, with only minor details changed.

====Season 3====
Having become Lord of Harrenhal, Petyr plans to sail to the Eyrie to offer Lysa Arryn a marriage proposal, taking Sansa with him. One of his prostitutes, Ros, learns of his plan and warns Varys, who arranges with Olenna Tyrell to have Sansa wed to Loras Tyrell. Baelish's spy Olyvar, who is posing as Loras' squire and lover, tips Baelish off to the plot; Baelish in turn gives this information to Tywin Lannister, who has Sansa wed to Tyrion instead. Realising that Ros has betrayed him, Baelish hands her over to Joffrey to kill for his entertainment.

====Season 4====
In the aftermath of Lysa Arryn's death, Baelish is questioned by several lords of the Vale. Baelish maintains that Lysa committed suicide, and Sansa corroborates this assertion. Baelish decides to take Robin Arryn on a tour of his domain, with Sansa accompanying them.

====Season 5====
Baelish brokers a marriage alliance between Sansa and Ramsay Bolton, the sadistic son of the new Warden of the North Roose Bolton. Although Baelish assures Roose that the marriage alliance will strengthen their respective positions, Baelish privately tells Sansa that Stannis Baratheon is marching on Winterfell and will likely defeat the Boltons in battle. However, before Sansa and Ramsay's wedding, Cersei summons Baelish to King's Landing to ascertain his loyalties. Baelish reassures Cersei of the Vale's allegiance to the Lannisters and tells her of Sansa's marriage to Ramsay, neglecting to reveal his role in arranging the marriage. Cersei is outraged, and Baelish offers to use the Vale's forces to defeat whoever is left of the Bolton and Baratheon armies following the battle, revealing that his true plan all along was to be named Warden of the North, a request Cersei grants. Before his departure Baelish meets with Olenna Tyrell, who is furious that testimony from Olyvar has led to the arrest of Margaery and Loras Tyrell. When Olenna threatens to reveal Baelish's role in Joffrey's murder, Baelish arranges for Lancel Lannister to tell religious leader the High Sparrow of Cersei's crimes, leading to her arrest.

====Season 6====
Baelish reunites with Robin Arryn at Runestone and claims that Sansa was abducted by the Boltons, before manipulating him into sending the Vale's forces to defend her. Baelish later meets Sansa in Mole's Town, insisting that he was unaware of Ramsay's cruelty. He offers the support of the knights of the Vale in retaking Winterfell and mentions that Sansa's great-uncle Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully has seized Riverrun from the Freys; Sansa refuses his offer and declares that she never wants to see him again. However, after Sansa and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] are unable to gather enough men to match the Boltons, Sansa sends a raven to Baelish asking for his aid. Baelish leads the men on Winterfell, and they arrive in time to destroy the unsuspecting Bolton army before they can slaughter the Starks. After the battle, Baelish reveals to Sansa that his ambition is to take the Iron Thrones with her at his side, but she rebuffs his advances. Baelish is present when the Northmen and Valemen declare Jon King in the North, but instead of cheering for Jon, he glares at Sansa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/27/game-of-thrones-the-winds-of-winter-review |title=Game of Thrones: &quot;The Winds of Winter&quot; Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 16, 2016 |date=June 27, 2016 |author=Fowler, Matt|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Baldwin'''  is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'' and its now-defunct spinoff ''[[Port Charles]]''. The character debuted played by child actors in the 1960s until [[Kin Shriner]] assumed the role in 1977. Scotty is often remembered as part of the love triangle with [[Luke and Laura Spencer]]. When his wife [[Laura Webber]] left him for [[Luke Spencer]], his devastation led to a drastic personality change. The character became one of ''General Hospital's'' long-running villains. However, on ''Port Charles'', the character was portrayed in a more heroic sense.

==Casting==
The character was originated as a child in the 1960s, played by the child actor [[Johnny Whitaker]] in 1965. He was succeeded by [[Ted Quinn|Teddy Quinn]] in 1966, Tony Camp from 1969 to 1972, Don Clarke from 1973 to 1974, and Johnny Jensen from 1974 to 1975.

The character of Scott is most commonly associated with [[Kin Shriner]], who assumed the role beginning  August 2, 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;November 2008 SOD&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.geniefrancis.com/trifecta.html|title=Trifecta|first=Tom|last=Stacy|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=November 18, 2008|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shriner left the series briefly to play Jeb Hampton on ''[[Texas (TV series)|Texas]]'', returning in 1982 for a one-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;82 Return&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Shriner returns|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tYQsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wc0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=scotty-baldwin%20general-hospital&amp;pg=2382%2C997348|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=February 5, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned again on November 27, 1987,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriner Return 87&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Reichardt|first=Nancy M.|title=Actor returns to 'General Hospital'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pz0sAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Lc4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=scotty-baldwin%20general-hospital&amp;pg=5329%2C589383|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=November 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving on December 24, 1993.

On January 14, 2013, it was announced that Shriner would return to ''General Hospital'' on February 19, making him the latest in a slew of returning fan favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/kin-shriner-back-gh|title=Kin Shriner Back To GH|date=January 14, 2013|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==
When Kin Shriner assumed the role in 1977, Scotty is a respectable young adult. He enters law school and has a promising future with his career and young love Laura. The two marry in 1979. However, when Laura is raped by Luke Spencer and subsequently falls in love with him, Scotty's devastation hardens his character. Laura leaves him and marries Luke in 1981. Scotty leaves town as Shriner left the series to pursue other opportunities. [[Executive Producer]] at the time [[Gloria Monty]] asked him to return a year later, ready to turn his character into a &quot;rat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1982 Change&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Goudas|first=John|title=Kin's become an intriguing heel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vaFlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VowNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=scotty-baldwin%20general-hospital&amp;pg=1844%2C4847974|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=August 20, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott becomes known for lying and scheming.&lt;ref name=Liars&gt;{{cite news|last=Goudas|first=John N.|title=Bringing back old lies and liars|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hf1NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=scotty-baldwin%20general-hospital&amp;pg=5666%2C1338310|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=The Free Lance-Star|date=January 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans accepted the change, both because he was more interesting to watch, and because they understood the character's past and felt that the betrayal of both the love of his life (Laura) and one of his good friends (Luke) left him a broken man and in turn caused him to become bitter and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|jaded]] about the world. Shiner explained in 1982:
{{cquote|I haven't gotten any flak for being a bad guy. People feel Scotty's behavior is justified because of his past. How would a guy feel when his woman (Laura) is raped, and then becomes involved with the rapist? No man is going to be the same after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;1982 Change&quot; /&gt;}}

==Storylines==

===1965–75===
The young Scotty Bentley first came to Port Charles with his mother Meg Bentley and stepsister Brooke, after the death of his father Lloyd. There was a lot of family strife in the first couple of years as Meg became engaged to the dashing Dr. Noel Clinton, sending Brooke into a tail-spin. Brooke never liked her stepmother Meg and felt that the engagement to Noel was a slap in the face to her dead father. In retaliation, Brooke seduced Noel and the two left town and wed. Meg was devastated. A short time later, she met and married Lee Baldwin. Lee adopted Scotty and the three became a family. Unfortunately, Meg developed breast cancer and had to have a radical mastectomy. The illness caused Meg to have a mental breakdown and Lee had no choice but to put her in a sanitarium where she soon after died. Lee now had to raise Scotty on his own. Scotty eventually left the show (went away to law school) for a time.

===1977–83===
When he returned, he obtained a job at the hospital, where he met the young [[Laura Webber]]. They fell in love and, after many obstacles (including the manipulations of Scotty's on-again/off-again lover and Laura's nemesis [[Bobbie Spencer]]), they finally married,&lt;ref name=&quot;Laura Wedding&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Scotty &amp; Laura Make It To The Alter...|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j_swAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xeAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=scotty-baldwin%20general-hospital&amp;pg=1276%2C1229590|accessdate=December 31, 2012|newspaper=Kentucky New Era|date=July 5, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their happiness was short-lived. Laura went to work at the Campus Disco for Bobbie's shady brother Luke, who became obsessed with her and eventually raped her. In spite of this, Laura fell in love with Luke and ran off with him, later divorcing Scotty after less than two years of marriage.

In 1981 at [[Luke and Laura Spencer#Luke &amp; Laura's 1981 wedding|Luke and Laura's wedding]], Scotty showed a darker side, as he caught the bridal bouquet and announced he was contesting his divorce from Laura. Since then, while Scott's more scrupulous side has re-emerged more than once, he always returned to engaging in underhanded and often illegal activities, even as district attorney of [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]]. He has had several brief relationships, and in 1982 married [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]], supposedly for financial reasons while he began an affair with [[Heather Webber (General Hospital)|Heather Webber]]. Susan was the mistress of the wealthy [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] and they had had a son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]], with a considerable trust fund. Susan was murdered, and Jason was then raised by Alan and his wife Monica. Scott left Port Charles soon afterward.

===1987–2004===
Scott returned in 1987 and helped to destroy Bobbie's marriage to Jake Meyer, before becoming involved in an off-on relationship with [[Lucy Coe]]. The two remained good friends, even after Scott married Dominique Stanton and Lucy offered to be a surrogate mother for Dominique when Dominique learned that she was dying. Sometime after Dominique died, Lucy gave birth to their child, whom Scott named Serena, after Dominique's beloved childhood home ''Serenity''. After an ill-advised engagement to Katherine Bell, Scotty left town once again, returning to Port Charles in 1997.

Scotty has a seat on the board of General Hospital, which he received after negotiating a solution to a nurses strike. He was also Luke's attorney during the murder trial of [[Stefan Cassadine]], though they fought constantly about how to handle the case, and as a result of Felicia's testimony, the case caused great strain in Luke and Laura's relationship. Scotty used this as an opportunity to continue manipulation of all things Laura, and they eventually started dating again. Luke was still in the picture though, which caused extreme jealousy on Scott's part. He pushed Laura to finalize her divorce with Luke, and then Scotty and Laura traveled to Hollywood together. Much of the storyline revolved around Scotty's struggle to suppress his jealousy of Luke, out of his genuine desire that Laura return to him willingly. Scotty did eventually blurt out a marriage proposal to Laura, but she ended up choosing Luke instead of him. Scotty couldn't talk her out of it, and eventually turned to his ex-girlfriend, [[Bobbie Spencer]].

When Luke and Laura were planning their new wedding, Laura's adoptive father, Dr. [[Rick Webber]], returned to town. Scott and Rick had some kind of shared secret, and Rick pulled strings to help Scott get elected to a position as District Attorney. It seemed that Laura was starting to remember something, and Scott and Rick went to the Scorpio's yard, where they dug up the human skeleton of Rick's old mistress, who had been killed (accidentally) by Laura. When Laura remembered and tried to confront Rick, he died from a blow to the head. Scott tried to pin the blame on Luke (supposedly because he feared that Laura had done it), and played on Luke's guilt that he may have caused Laura's mental breakdown by pushing her to remember. Luke was sentenced to life in prison, but escaped and left town.

Bobbie eventually broke up with Scott, because of his dirty tactics against Alexis in the run for D.A. Later, Luke returned to town and was arrested again. But [[Nikolas Cassadine]] had obtained tapes of Laura confessing to Rick Webber's murder, and Alexis used the tapes to force Scott to drop the charges against Luke, in return for Alexis dropping out of the election. Scotty then had Luke committed to an asylum, for what he had done to Laura. Scott was an extremely corrupt DA, frequently using his position to take action against his enemies, at one point even ordering Luke arrested by his own son, [[Lucky Spencer|Lucky]].

During the storyline with the Port Charles Hotel fire, Scotty faked his own death in order to steal a treasure from Skye. He was faced with an investigation by Internal Affairs and fled the city with the money, presumably leaving with his daughter Serena. From an offshore tropical beach paradise he sent Luke a farewell videotape, taunting him.

===2007–08===
In 2007, Scott returns, and it is revealed that he had frequently been visiting the comatose Laura. In March, Luke's daughter [[Lulu Spencer]] and stepson [[Dillon Quartermaine]] intercept a letter from [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] to Luke. In the event of his death, he had the letter sent identifying Scott as Rick Webber's killer. Soon after, Scott visits Laura and confesses to her. He explains that he had gone to see Laura that night and heard screaming coming from the attic. When he got inside he saw Rick trying to inject Laura, so he had grabbed a candlestick and hit him over the head, unintentionally killing him. He left and by the time Luke got there, Laura had been so far gone that she didn't remember Scott being there. Lulu had already told her mother the truth, unsuccessfully hoping it would bring Laura out of her catatonic state. Meanwhile, an ex Iraqi soldier, [[Logan Hayes]], comes to Port Charles and it is eventually revealed that Scott had fathered a son in Texas around the same time that Logan was born. Logan admits he had found letters Scott had written to his mother, and a DNA test proves they are father and son.

In the beginning of 2008, Scott and Logan have a rift when Scott accuses Logan of taking police files to blackmail [[Johnny Zacchara]], in order to keep him away from Lulu, who Logan is trying to win back. Scott puts pressure on [[Alexis Davis]] to hand over her job as District Attorney to him. In July, Lulu kills Logan in self-defense, devastating Scott. Johnny takes the blame for Lulu, and Scott is the prosecutor in his trial. He uses dirty tricks to get Johnny the death penalty, including forging papers stating his son was working undercover for the police. He calls Lulu to the stand, who has become mentally unstable from the ordeal. When Johnny is acquitted and Scott is enraged.

When Scott finds out Lulu was the killer, he threatens her in front of Laura, who awakens and defends her daughter. Scott then kidnaps Laura and takes her to Los Angeles, to relive their honeymoon. Luke, Tracy, Nikolas, Lucky and Lulu pursue them and bring her home. As Laura boards a plane to France to seek further treatment, Scott is seen behind her on the plane. It is presumed he has gone to live in Paris near Laura and his daughter, Serena.

===2013—===
In February 2013, Scott resurfaces in Port Charles, revealing to a bewildered Luke that he and Laura are engaged. Scott's return to town also coincides with the appearance of a replica of the infamous Ice Princess Diamond, which had been addressed to Lulu on Valentine's Day. Scott than tries to marry Laura before Luke tries to get Laura back. He does succeed but Laura spends a great time away with Luke, after Lulu is kidnapped. When Laura finally does return, Scott asks her for a divorce, saying it is the best for both of them. He then focuses his energies on winning his old position as district attorney of Port Charles. Scott is given incriminating evidence of his running mate, Lazaro with resident mob boss, Sonny Corinthos, he approaches Lazaro who bows out of the race. After notifying the mayor Scott is named district attorney. As his first act as D.A. he attempts to send Heather Webber back into custody along with serial-killer, [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] for fraud and aiding and abetting Webber during [[Robin Scorpio|Robin's]] kidnapping. Heather contests and confesses that Franco is his son. Back when Laura had requested a divorce from Scott, he was consumed with anger and grief and had gotten intoxicated at Kelly's one night. Heather, who was also drunk had found him there and that is when Franco was conceived. Scott doesn't believe it but Heather has a birth certificate and D.N.A. tests to back up her claim. Scott realizes that Heather is telling the truth, while also lamenting his career is over because of what will come out about his familial connections. On January 8, 2014 it was mentioned that Scott had finalized his divorce from Laura. Scott also told Lucy that after their one night stand his feelings for her has returned again because he was never tricked by [[Jerry Jacks]].

'''Cad Bane''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' franchise]], created by [[George Lucas]], [[Dave Filoni]] and [[Henry Gilroy]] as a recurring [[antagonist]] voiced by [[Corey Burton]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. The character is a cold and manipulative [[bounty hunter]] from the planet [[Duro (Star Wars)|Duro]].

==Concept and creation==
The character was created for the 2008 ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' television series set during the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]]. The season one finale &quot;Hostage Crisis&quot; director [[Giancarlo Volpe]] compared Cad Bane to another ''[[Star Wars]]'' bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] stating,

{{quote|The crew loves Cad Bane, and I really think the fans will, too. He brings a serious bad-ass sensibility to ''Star Wars''. He's a lethal and ruthless bounty hunter, and you see that right away in the episode. Unlike Boba Fett, Cad doesn't take prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/theclonewars/news20090317.html |title=The Chilling Season Finale Introduces a Deadly New Enemy |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=Lucas Online |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Originally, supervising director Dave Filoni and series writer Henry Gilroy planned to create the Durge character that was already introduced in the [[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|2003 micro-series]]. Durge would instead be redesigned as a human character but this exploration was short lived after the suggestion of series producer and ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas to go [[Western (genre)|Western]]. Lucas took inspiration from western film actors such as [[Lee Van Cleef]]'s portrayal of Angel Eyes in ''[[The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly]]'' and of Colonel Mortimer in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' while Corey Burton uses [[Peter Lorre]]'s voice as inspiration.&lt;ref name=Databank/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cad Bane concept|url=http://starwarsblog.starwars.com/index.php/2009/02/28/report-from-wondercon-2009-lucasfilm-presentation-part-ii-meet-cad-bane/|accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characters' [[American Old West|Western]] influences help to bring Bane to life while still containing the features of the Duros species in the ''Star Wars'' universe with his own original characterization. Burton's voice would then be modified on the computer by the series' sound production team. While Filoni researched the character, he happened to come across an unlabeled concept art of a gun-toting bounty hunter with a wide-brimmed hat from the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]] and that concept helped bring the character to life.&lt;ref name=Databank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/cadbane/index.html |title=Databank: Cad Bane |publisher=Lucas Online |year=2010 |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Something you notice about George Lucas after a while is that he'll mention a name like '[[Mace Windu]]' in a [1973] version of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and then it pops up in 1999. So, this, I guess might have been an idea George had for the character Cad Bane way back when, and now finally he's getting around to bringing him to the screen in ''The Clone Wars''.&lt;ref name=Databank/&gt;|David Filoni}}

==Appearances==
Cad Bane first appears in the season one finale &quot;[[Hostage Crisis (Clone Wars episode)|Hostage Crisis]]&quot;, where he infiltrates the Senate building on [[Coruscant]] to hold senators hostage in exchange for the release of Ziro the Hutt. It is revealed in season three that he was hired by [[Jabba the Hutt]] to extract Ziro due to an incriminating datapad the latter possessed, and he is hired in the episode &quot;Hunt for Ziro&quot; to track and capture the rogue [[Hutt (Star Wars)|Hutt]], but the latter is instead assassinated by Sy Snootles.

In the second season, Cad Bane is contacted by [[Darth Sidious]] for a special assignment: the capture of a Holocron from inside the Jedi Temple. Bane finds himself in a massive struggle for the stolen Holocron as Skywalker and [[Ahsoka Tano]] attempt to take it back. He is briefly captured before leading [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Mace Windu]] into a trap in his headquarters, allowing him to escape.

During the fourth season, Cad Bane is revealed to be in a Republic prison. He is then hired by fellow convict Moralo Eval for a job by [[Count Dooku]] to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine on Naboo. However, Kenobi poses as bounty hunter Rako Hardeen and manages to foil the plot even though Dooku escapes while Bane was arrested. Bane does not appear in the fifth season.

==Promotion and reception==
Cad Bane has been featured in two [[Hasbro]] toys concerning himself, his blaster and his ship respectively,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbro1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/shop/details.cfm?guid=5FB376E8-19B9-F369-107E-F9DCA6D8CD94&amp;product_id=27048 |title=Star Wars The Clone Wars Cad Bane |work=[[Hasbro]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbro2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/shop/details.cfm?guid=7E120EC7-5056-9000-6DBF-87B6A423AC11&amp;product_id=27731 |title=Star Wars The Clone Wars Cad Bane Blaster |work=Hasbro |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbro3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/shop/details.cfm?guid=E9D198FD-5056-900B-103A-D72D4BE11E7E&amp;product_id=27665 |title=Star Wars The Clone Wars Cad Bane’s Xanadu Blood |work=Hasbro |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one involving him merged with his ship in a crossover for ''[[Transformers]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbro4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/shop/details.cfm?guid=8AFFBC6A-19B9-F369-1093-1B07DEDB3B09&amp;product_id=27466 |title=Star Wars TRANSFORMERS CROSSOVERS Cad Bane to Cad Bane's Xanadu Blood |work=Hasbro |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cad Bane and his speeder were included as part of the [[Lego Star Wars|Lego ''Star Wars'']] toy line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lego1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=853127&amp;LangId=2057 |title=LEGO® Star Wars™ Cad Bane™ Key Chain |work=[[Lego|Lego Shop]] |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lego2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=8128&amp;LangId=2057 |title=Cad Bane’s Speeder™ |work=Lego Shop |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eli Bard''' (born '''Eliphas''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a member of the [[Purifiers]] and an enemy of the [[X-Men]].

==Fictional character biography==
Eli Bard's back story was told, through a flashback, by [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] to the rest of [[X-Force]] in X-Force #11 (2009). Warpath obtained this knowledge through a vision with the help of [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].{{issue|date=June 2016}}

Eli Bard was born &quot;Eliphas&quot; at the height of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was recognized as an outstanding soldier until a spear injury ended his military career. For a while he worked unsuccessfully as a poet until he met Aurelia, one of the most powerful women in Rome. He soon married her and achieved a position in the Senate. As a well-respected senator, he was known as a great orator and a friend to the army. His wife left him for a general named Mascius and conspired to give Mascius his seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Force #11 March 2009&quot;&gt;''X-Force'' #11 (March, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Left with nothing, Eliphas was approached by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], who offered him immortality in exchange for helping her kill and absorb every soul in Rome. Eliphas drew [[pentagram]]s and performed rituals at several locations in the city, but warned a small girl to get her family out. The girl's father alerted the authorities and Eliphas and Selene were captured before the spell could be carried out. Just before they were [[burned at the stake]], Selene killed the guards. She cursed Eliphas for his perceived betrayal with an eternal life of torture, turning him into a vampire-like creature. Eliphas was buried alive for 700 years until a farmer discovered him in his field. Eliphas killed the farmer with a swift bite to the jugular. He spent the next several hundred years searching for Selene. He ran into the ancestral [[Apache]] tribe of [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]. They recognized him as a vampire but could not stop him from wiping out almost the entire tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Force #11 March 2009&quot;/&gt;

Eliphas, having at some point in time changed his name to &quot;Eli Bard,&quot; finally located Selene in [[Nova Roma (disambiguation)|Nova Roma]], where she was worshiped as a god. Still in love with her despite her curse, Bard realized that he must make an offering to her before approaching her.{{issue|date=June 2016}}

Bard later joined the Purifiers, an anti-mutant terrorist group. During this time, he worked diligently to further the Purifiers' goals. Secretly, however, he had hoped to sacrifice thousands of Purifiers' souls using the same ritual from Rome in order to gain Selene's attention. He assisted in the resurrection of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] but the android was suspicious of him, as he had no record on him. After seeing Bastion reprogram an offspring of Magus, he changed his plan and instead re-animated the corpses in the burial grounds of the Apache tribe that he had decimated decades earlier using the [[Techno-organic virus|Technarch transmode virus]] he had absorbed from an offspring of [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]]. Among the bodies reanimated were those of the mutants [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. He presented Caliban to Selene and stated that he intended to use Caliban's mutant tracking abilities to track down deceased mutants and reanimate them to form an army for Selene, an offer which she accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;X-Force #11 March 2009&quot;/&gt;

Eli Bard is shown with [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] and [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] by the grave of [[Doug Ramsey]] in ''[[X-Force]]'' #18 (2009).

He uses the virus to resurrect a variety of mutants, including Cypher,{{issue|date=June 2016}} [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]],{{issue|date=June 2016}} the original [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]],{{issue|date=June 2016}} [[Risque (comics)|Risque]],{{issue|date=June 2016}} [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]],{{issue|date=June 2016}} and [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]].{{issue|date=June 2016}}

In ''X-Force'' #21, Selene's plans culminates when Bard uses the virus to resurrect the entire deceased mutant populace of Genosha.

When Bard returned to Proudstar's tribe's burial grounds to resurrect Caliban and Thunderbird, the spirits of the tribe rose to protect those buried there. Bard attacked them with Selene's mystical knife, transforming them into a Demon Bear.{{issue|date=June 2016}} After fleeing the battle, Bard leaves the blade behind, unaware it was pivotal in Selene's plans. He is then dispatched to Utopia to retrieve it, taking Warpath hostage in the process.{{issue|date=June 2016}} When he returns to Selene with the blade and the hostage, Selene kills him by stabbing him in the heart with the blade, reducing him to bones.{{issue|date=June 2016}}

==Powers and abilities==
Through Selene's magical curse, Eli Bard became an immortal vampire-like being. Unlike Selene's [[Psychic vampire|psychic vampirism]], Bard seems to be of the more traditional blood sucking variety. As such, he has increased speed and strength, and is difficult (if not impossible) to kill. Bard also has limited knowledge of magic. He also demonstrated deadly skills in hand-to-hand combat, managing to overpower and nearly kill X-23.

Bard has also been altered at a molecular level by a techno-organic transmode virus taken from the Technarch spawn under the Purifiers' control.  The virus gives him the ability to control those he reanimates.  The virus has the potential to provide shapeshifting and other superhuman abilities.

'''Avon Randolph Barksdale''' is a [[fictional character]] in ''[[The Wire]]'', played by [[Wood Harris]]. Avon is one of the more powerful [[drug dealer]]s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], running the [[Barksdale Organization]]. His Organization territory is based in the heart of west Baltimore's ghetto, solidifying his power in the drug trade.

Avon's best friend [[Stringer Bell]] is second in command and runs most of the operation, insulating Avon from law enforcement and potential enemies. Below Avon and Bell is a large organization of drug dealers and enforcers, including Avon's nephew [[D'Angelo Barksdale]], son of Brianna Barksdale, Avon's sister. Accepting nothing less than absolute power, Avon is interested only in controlling the drug trade in west Baltimore, believing that the control of territory is key to such objective.

He is hot-tempered, very concerned with his image on the street, and quick to send violent warnings to other crews. He is also shrewd and intuitive, though not as cerebral as Stringer. Avon was partly based on real-life gang leader [[Nathan Barksdale]] who ran a drug selling operation in West Baltimore.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Avon Barksdale was born on August 15, 1970 at [[Provident Hospital (Baltimore)|Provident Hospital]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;The Wire - Season one, episode three&lt;/ref&gt; Barksdale grew up in the Franklin Terrace [[public housing in the United States|public housing project]]. As of season one, Barksdale had no criminal record as his juvenile record was [[expunged]] and he has not been arrested as an adult. Up until the Barksdale Investigation, Barksdale remained a furtive but increasingly powerful force on the west side of Baltimore's drug trade. Avon is the son of Butch Stamford, though no father is listed on his birth certificate. Stamford was an infamous Baltimore criminal, whose name is known by both the police and other drug traffickers. Avon, a former amateur boxer who once fought in a [[Golden Gloves]] Tournament, was taught by his father how to survive in &quot;[[Illegal drug trade|the game]]&quot; at an early age.

===Criminal organization===
{{main|Barksdale Organization}}
At the beginning of the series, Avon is the top player in the West Baltimore drug trade. His territory included the prized Franklin Terrace Towers, a public housing project consisting of six high rise apartment buildings. Avon also controls other smaller territory like a nearby low-rise housing project referred to as &quot;the Pit&quot; (or the courtyard). Avon ran the organization as a hierarchy with himself at the top and Stringer directly below him. They were both isolated from the drugs, handling only money. Avon himself kept an extremely low profile, eschewing overt displays of wealth so as not to attract attention and owning nothing in his own name. He retained attorney Maurice Levy, who advised him on how to counter police investigations and represented members of the Barksdale organization at hearings and trials.

Avon has a number of enforcers for protection, [[contract killing]]s, and intimidation work, including his old friend [[Wee-Bey Brice]]. He has several [[lieutenant]]s reporting to him, each responsible for a drug crew in a different area. Beneath the lieutenants there were hoppers who would collect customers money, serve drugs and lookout for police.

Every member of the organization are subject to strict rules designed to thwart police investigations. The dealers are not allowed to carry cell phones or take drugs. They are all aware of how to deal with police interrogation and know that the organization can only protect them up until a certain point, but if they turn on Avon they could be killed. Lieutenants and enforcers carry [[pager]]s so that they can be contacted. They know not to talk business in cars, public places or with anyone outside of the organization. Such discussions are limited to property and territory owned by the Barksdale organization.

A strict telephone usage policy is applied rigidly throughout the organization. The pager messages are encoded to prevent easy tracing of the [[payphone]]s being used. Each pager-carrying member of the organization is identified by a number. When pages were returned with a phone call no names were supposed to be used, and if a name was used, the speaker was rebuked.

Avon received his narcotics supply through a connection to a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] organization in New York. The main supply of narcotics was separated from the rest of the organization and held in a house in [[Pimlico, Baltimore|Pimlico]] where it could be [[Cutting agent|cut]] and divided into smaller &quot;stashes&quot; for distribution among the Barksdale towers.

Avon's main office was one of his [[front organization]]s, a strip club named Orlando's. It was here, behind a locked and heavily guarded door, that the drug money was counted and secured before being sent on to its ultimate destination. Avon usually conducted his business in this office, rarely venturing onto the street. The organization laundered its profits through various companies, including a funeral parlor, Orlando's, and a property developing company named B&amp;B. It also invested in property,and made bribes and campaign contributions for assistance with development contracts.

===Season One===
[[Image:Barksdale1.jpg|thumb|right|The Barksdale Organization (season one)]]
Avon's errant nephew and lieutenant [[D'Angelo Barksdale|D'Angelo]] has murdered a dealer named Pooh Blanchard, so Avon had Stringer pay a witness, Nakeesha Lyles, to change her story in court. D'Angelo gets acquitted, but Avon chastises him for costing the organization time and money, and demotes him from the 221 Tower into &quot;The Pit&quot; to replace [[Barksdale Organization#Ronnie Mo|Ronnie Mo]], who had recently been promoted to his own tower. Avon also orders [[Barksdale Organization#Bird|&quot;Bird&quot; Hilton]] to murder a second witness, William Gant, whom he had been unable to intimidate or bribe. The body is left on display outside the 221 Tower, to send a message to people who might consider testifying. D'Angelo is shaken by the murder and begins to have second thoughts about his life, but Avon persuades him to remain loyal to the family.

Avon is angered when The Pit's stash is robbed by [[Omar Little]], and he places a heavy bounty on Omar and his crew (nearly doubling it upon realizing Omar was homosexual). Wee-Bey kills [[Omar Little and Associates#John Bailey|John Bailey]], a member of Omar's crew. Omar's lover [[Omar Little and Associates#Brandon|Brandon Wright]] is captured and tortured by Stringer, Wee-Bey, Bird and Stinkum. In response, Omar kills Stinkum and wounds Wee-Bey, culminating with a failed assassination attempt on Avon outside of Orlando's. Wee-Bey manages to save Avon at the last minute.

The Pit is also subject to police raids which seize a second resupply of narcotics and arrest a carrier named Kevin Johnston and a dealer named Robert Browning. The police also seize an entire day's profits from Wee-Bey, totalling $22,000. They also briefly seize a payment on its way to [[Clay Davis]] but are forced to return it because of his political influence. The robbery and police activity combined raise suspicion that there is a leak in the pit, and an increasingly paranoid Avon orders D'Angelo to remove the pay phones (which had indeed been wiretapped).

Barksdale's front man [[Barksdale Organization#Wendell &quot;Orlando&quot; Blocker|Orlando Blocker]] has been trying to take part in the drug trade, and Avon feels obliged to beat him, warning him that the only reason he is a front man was because he was clean. Orlando persists in trying to go into the business for himself, and ultimately gets arrested by an undercover state police officer. Avon promptly has his name removed from the club's license. Orlando agrees to aid the police in their investigation, and Avon orders Wee-Bey, [[Barksdale Organization#Little Man|Little Man]] and [[Barksdale Organization#Savino Bratton|Savino]] to kill him. The job is complicated when they accidentally shoot the undercover [[Kima Greggs]], accompanying Orlando at the time. This leads to a massive crackdown from the police. Savino is forced to turn himself in, but faces a sentence of just three years for drug charges because he was not directly implicated in the shooting. Avon and Stringer hold a crisis meeting with attorney [[Maurice Levy (The Wire)|Maurice Levy]], who advises them to remove any possible loose ends. Avon orders several murders, including unreliable enforcer Little Man, bribed witness Nakeesha Lyles and a young dealer from The Pit named [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]].

Avon finally incriminates himself on a hidden camera in his office when sending D'Angelo to pick up a package of drugs. He is arrested by [[Jimmy McNulty]] and [[Cedric Daniels]] on charges of possession with intent to distribute, but as this was the only arrest he had ever incurred he was sentenced to a total of seven years with possibility of parole.

===Season Two===
[[Image:Barksdale2.jpg|thumb|right|The Barksdale Organization (season two)]]
Avon continues to run his organization from within the prison through Stringer. D'Angelo and Wee-Bey are imprisoned alongside Avon, both due to serve much longer terms. A prison guard named [[Law enforcement characters of The Wire#Dwight Tilghman|Dwight Tilghman]] is harassing Wee-Bey as Wee-Bey killed one of his relatives. Avon tries to reason with Tilghman, but the guard refuses to talk to him. Avon and Stringer know that Tilghman has a sideline and smuggles narcotics into the prison. Stringer approaches Tilghman's supplier [[Butchie]] and pays him to supply Tilghman with tainted heroin on his next visit. The tainted heroin kills five inmates and hospitalizes eight others. The warden opens an investigation, to which Avon comes forward as an &quot;informant&quot;, accusing Tilghman of the crime. The [[Maryland State Police]] subsequently search Tilghman's car, finding drugs in a sweets packet, and arrest Tilghman despite his protest that the drugs were planted. For his &quot;testimony&quot;, Avon's first parole hearing is advanced up a year. Despite being the one ultimately responsible for the crime, he is due to be out of jail within a year. D'Angelo grows more distant from Avon, refusing to take part in the scheme, and seeming depressed, even turning to drug use. Without Avon's knowledge, Stringer has D'Angelo killed and his death staged to look like a suicide.

Because Avon's arrest was closely followed by the arrest of one of their suppliers, the New York-based Dominicans are suspicious that Avon might have named them to receive a lighter sentence, and the business relationship is brought to an end. Avon recommends secondary sources to Stringer but is unable to secure anything much better. Stringer tells Avon that Proposition Joe has offered to provide his high-quality heroin in exchange for letting Joe's men work on some of Avon's prime territory. Avon quickly dismisses the idea, reminding Stringer how hard they worked to seize the territory in the first place. However, Stringer eventually decides to allow Proposition Joe to move in despite Avon's order. Not knowing that Stringer had agreed to the arrangement behind his back, Avon contracts the feared [[Brother Mouzone]] to defend his turf. Stringer responds by tricking Omar into believing that Mouzone tortured and killed Brandon. Omar shoots Mouzone, but lets him live after realizing things didn't add up. Mouzone returns to New York to recover from his wounds and Avon reluctantly agrees to Proposition Joe's proposal.

===Season Three===
[[Image:Barksdale3.jpg|thumb|right|The Barksdale Organization (season three)]]
Upon his release from prison, Avon is showered with gifts by Stringer: a nightclub, a [[penthouse apartment]], expensive clothes, and a new SUV. Avon, while appreciative of Stringer's largesse, is outraged that Stringer has let their control over their territory slip as much as it has, and gets involved in a gang war with [[Marlo Stanfield]]. In one such attempt, Avon employs a woman named Devonne through [[Barksdale Organization#Slim Charles|Slim Charles]] to find Marlo. She encounters Marlo in a bar, seduces him, and gives him her phone number so they can meet up again. When they later plan to meet up, [[Chris Partlow]] spots an SUV responding to Devonne's presence and correctly deduces that the meeting is an ambush. Chris has his driver pull up to the Barksdale car, and then fires a shotgun blast through his side window, wounding Avon and killing a Barksdale soldier named Tater. Later, Marlo and Chris track down Devonne, and Marlo shoots her to death in front of her house.

When two &quot;hitters&quot; in his organization, under the direction of Stringer, attempt a hit on Omar as he accompanies his grandmother to church, Avon is angered by the breach of a long-standing tradition of an unspoken truce on Sunday mornings. Omar's elderly grandmother loses her hat during the failed hit. Avon is also worried by rumors of &quot;Omar's granny getting shot in the ass&quot; and the shooters &quot;pissing on her hat&quot; circulating amongst rival gangs. After letting the soldiers responsible wait for hours at headquarters, he tells Stringer that the only repercussions he would impose on them would be to require them to buy Omar's grandmother a new hat.

Avon also makes an effort to recruit [[Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise]] into the organization, due to Cutty's legendary past as a soldier and his and Avon's near-coincident release dates (Cutty's imprisonment having lasted 14 years). Cutty joins the group for a time but soon admits that the game is not in him anymore. Avon, disappointed but understanding, allows the old soldier to retire on respectful terms. Later, when Cutty asks for $10,000 to help start a boxing gym for neighborhood boys, Avon happily offers him $15,000 cash.

Avon and Stringer continue to clash over their conflicting methods of leadership; Proposition Joe tells Stringer that he will withhold his supply of high-quality drugs from the Barksdale organization if Avon's war with Stanfield continues, but Avon believes that giving in to Stanfield will make the organization look weak and diminish its standing. During an argument with Avon, Stringer reveals that he had D'Angelo killed for the good of the organization. The revelation damages their relationship irreparably. 

In an effort to return Avon to prison and thereby remove him as an obstacle to Stringer's business aims, Stringer contacts [[Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin|Major Colvin]] and reveals the location of Avon's weapons safehouse. Meanwhile, Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and confronts Avon about Stringer's attempt to engineer a conflict between Mouzone and Omar. Mouzone threatens to use his connections to cut off the Barksdale organization's supply of drugs from New York and destroy Avon's credibility. In an effort to avoid a war with Mouzone, Avon reluctantly provides Mouzone with information about Stringer's whereabouts as a result of their seemingly irreconcilable philosophical differences in how to run the organization, and Mouzone and Omar kill Stringer. Avon privately admits to Slim Charles that, contrary to rumors that Stringer fell at the hands of Stanfield's crew, Stringer actually died because of &quot;some other shit.&quot; Depressed, Avon concedes that he has come around to Stringer's point of view and is tired of &quot;beefing over a couple fuckin' corners.&quot; Slim retorts that they are already in a war, and even if the premise for it is false, they must still fight on it.

Avon is ultimately arrested again; based on evidence that Stringer provided to Colvin, the Major Crimes Unit raids Avon's wartime safehouse and are able to put weapons and conspiracy charges on all those present. Avon's presence at the time of the arrest constitutes a parole violation which mandates serving the remaining five years of his seven-year sentence. Avon's lieutenants claim ownership of all the weapons, suggesting that the state's attorney will have a difficult time pinning any further charges on him. At the montage at the end of season three, Avon sits at the defense table at a court room with all those apprehended during the bust sitting behind him. The shot has no dialog, so it is unclear just how long Avon's new sentence will be. However, it is later confirmed via the site run by HBO dedicated to ''The Wire'' that Avon did in fact receive an additional twenty five years of jail time for conspiracy to commit murder, on top of the remaining five years left over from his initial sentence of seven years due to his parole violation.&lt;ref name = &quot;AB&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Five===
Early in season 5, [[Marlo Stanfield]] arranges a meeting with former Greek soldier [[Sergei Malatov]] at MCI Jessup in the hopes of contacting [[The Greeks of The Wire|The Greeks]] and [[Spiros Vondas]]. However, when he visits the prison, he instead encounters Avon, who reveals that he still has a formidable reputation in the prison, and that Sergei had approached him once he began receiving direct payments from Marlo in order to get on Sergei's visiting list. Avon explains that he has intuited Marlo's plan of using Sergei to contact Vondas. Avon agrees, philosophically, with Marlo's plan to get around [[Proposition Joe]] and the other Eastsiders and cut them out of the supply connection (this could also be due to Joe's past dealings with Stringer behind Avon's back). Avon playfully espouses love for Westsiders and states that he is prepared to let bygones be bygones in regards to their past war. However, he informs Marlo that in order to gain access to Sergei, Marlo has to pay Brianna $100,000. Marlo agrees, makes the payment, and at his next visit to Jessup, Avon grants him access to Sergei. Marlo and Sergei meet, with Avon overseeing. Sergei is initially uninterested in cooperating with Marlo's plan and refers to him dismissively, but is swayed when Marlo points out that if any arrangement he can make with Vondas are beneficial to the Greeks, it will be Sergei who &quot;made it happen&quot;. By the end of the series, Marlo's second-in-command [[Chris Partlow]] has made peace with Avon's organization as well, as he is seen fraternizing with [[Wee-Bey Brice]] in prison courtyard.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Wire E52&quot;&gt;{{cite episode

'''D'Angelo''' &quot;'''D'''&quot; '''Barksdale''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', played by [[Larry Gilliard Jr.]] D'Angelo is the nephew of [[Avon Barksdale]] and a lieutenant in his drug dealing organization which controls most of the trade in West Baltimore. The immorality and ruthlessness of the drug trade gradually wears on his conscience, bringing him into conflict with the Barksdale leadership, most notably [[Stringer Bell]].

==Biography==
===Season one===
D'Angelo Barksdale is a high-ranking lieutenant in the criminal organization of his uncle [[Avon Barksdale]]; his mother [[Barksdale Organization#Brianna Barksdale|Brianna]] is also a high-ranking advisor. Prior to the series, D'Angelo controlled the high-rise tower of 221 West Fremont, a major drug market. He was confronted by dealer &quot;Pooh&quot; Blanchard in the lobby and, in a panic, shot him in front of civilian witnesses. He was quickly arrested and served 8 months in county jail before, in the series premiere, standing trial for this murder, represented by the organization's lawyer [[Maurice Levy (The Wire)|Maurice Levy]]. Though one witness, William Gant, willingly testifies, the organization has scared and/or bribed the other witness,  Nakeesha Lyles, to recant her testimony. D'Angelo is thus acquitted. As punishment for his carelessness, Avon demotes D'Angelo to the low rise projects known as &quot;The Pit&quot;, where his crew consists of [[Bodie Broadus]], [[Poot (The Wire)|Poot]], [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]], Cass and [[Barksdale Organization#Sterling|Sterling]]. 

Over the course of the season, D'Angelo grows more and more ambivalent about the drug trade. When William Gant turns up dead, D'Angelo is shaken, assuming Avon had it done as revenge for testifying. He is brought in for questioning by detectives [[Jimmy McNulty]] and [[Bunk Moreland]], who trick him into writing a letter of apology to Gant's fictitious family (in actuality a photo of Bunk's family). Levy arrives and stops him before he can write anything incriminating, and he is released. He questions his uncle, who evades his accusations and persuades him to remain loyal to the family.

D'Angelo is very hesitant about discipline (such as the brutal beating of [[List of characters from The Wire#Johnny Weeks|Johnny Weeks]], or punishing dealers Cass and Sterling for stealing small amounts).

D'Angelo is also unwittingly involved in a second murder, Avon's girlfriend Deirdre Kresson. When cooperating with the police  after his arrest they question him about this murder. D'Angelo claims he had delivered drugs to Kresson, serving as a distraction when [[Wee-Bey Brice]] killed her. Wee-Bey gladly takes the blame for this and other murders that were unsolved at the time of his arrest since he was facing life without parole either way. Earlier in the season, D'Angelo had falsely claimed responsibility for killing Kresson himself, apparently in an attempt to impress his subordinates Bodie, Poot and Wallace.

D'Angelo has a son, Tyrell, by girlfriend [[Barksdale Organization#Donette|Donette]]. She wants him to move in with her, but her nagging often drives him away. D'Angelo begins dating a dancer from his uncle's strip club, [[Barksdale Organization#Shardene Innes|Shardene Innes]], and lives with her for a short time, until Shardene finds out from the police that her colleague Keesha had overdosed, died, and was left in a dumpster after attending a Barksdale crew party. She accuses D'Angelo of seeing her as trash that could easily be discarded, and moves out. She goes on to cooperate with the police unit investigating the Barksdale clan and later begins a relationship with [[Lester Freamon]].

Under D'Angelo's firm leadership, The Pit begins to turn a good profit. It nevertheless becomes a cause for concern when its stash is stolen by [[Omar Little]], and, the next day, the police raid. (Their information is slightly outdated, and they raid a now abandoned stash house, but Lester finds D'Angelo's encrypted pager number on a wall.)
Stringer chastises D'Angelo for his sloppiness, and Avon places a bounty on Omar's crew. Wallace and Poot identify Omar's boyfriend, Brandon, in an arcade; D'Angelo relays the message to Stringer, who has Brandon captured, tortured and killed. Wallace becomes haunted by his role in the death of Brandon. 
 
Relating to Wallace's aversion to the violence of their trade, D'Angelo develops a friendship with Wallace. When Wallace wants to leave the business after seeing Brandon's mutilated remains, D'Angelo is supportive and gives him money. Stringer begins asking after Wallace; D'Angelo senses that Wallace is in trouble and asks Avon to leave him alone, reassuring him that Wallace is no danger to the organization. When Wallace returns and asks for his old job back, D'Angelo tries to get him to leave, but is unable to save him. Wallace is killed on Stringer's orders, though D'Angelo remains unaware that Bodie and Poot killed him.

Based indirectly on information Shardene provided to the police (the microphone inside the club which listens to Avon), D'Angelo is arrested while running drugs from New York, and again interrogated. McNulty tells him Wallace is dead. D'Angelo remembers the trick from before that got him writing a letter to Gant's fictitious family and doesn't believe him at first. Stringer comes to talk to him and refuses to answer when D'Angelo demands to know where Wallace is. Stringer warns D'Angelo to shut his mouth which confirms in D'Angelo's mind what had happened. He grows angry and tells Stringer he doesn't want to use Levy, permanently driving a wedge in their already fractured relationship. D'Angelo is furious at Wallace's death, and briefly turns state's witness against the Organization. He tells them where Wee-Bey has fled to after shooting [[Kima Greggs]], and offers numerous details of his uncle's organization. However, a visit from [[List of characters from The Wire#Brianna Barksdale|his mother]] convinces him of his duty to his family, and he reneges on the deal. Due to his refusal to cooperate, he is sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison.  While serving his sentence, he says the best he can hope for is 10 years before a possibility for parole.

===Season two===
While in prison with Avon and Wee-Bey, D'Angelo turns to snorting heroin. Though he is distant from his uncle, Avon still protects him, and gets him a cushy job in the prison library. Wee-Bey is being harassed by a guard named Dwight Tilghman, who is involved in the prison drug trade. Avon arranges to have his heroin supply laced with rat poison, and advises D'Angelo to stay off the drug for a few days to prove he's not an addict, but does not tell D'Angelo of the plan. Had D'Angelo not taken his uncle's advice he could easily have died himself. At least one of the inmates D'Angelo was friendly with accepted doses of the tainted drugs. After five prisoners die and eight more are in the infirmary, Avon informs on Tilghman in exchange for an earlier parole board hearing and a recommendation for release by the investigators. D'Angelo refuses to take part in the plan and, disgusted by his uncle's immorality, declares that he wants nothing more to do with his family. 

Stringer Bell grows afraid that D'Angelo may inform on the organization, knowing how close he had previously been. He hires a contract killer from [[Washington D.C.]], who in turn arranges for a prisoner to strangle D'Angelo with a belt in the back room of the library, staging his body to look like a suicide. No investigation is launched, although McNulty becomes convinced that it was a murder when he is belatedly informed and investigates it, on his own. The family members continue to believe it was a suicide until McNulty confronts Donette and Brianna with his suspicions, and Stringer finally tells Avon in season three.

==Critical response==
A ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' review picked the scene of D'Angelo instructing Bodie and Wallace on the rules of chess as one of the first season's finest moments.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Francisco Chronicle 2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/06/05/DD113931.DTL|title=Fighting crime, and bureaucrats.

'''Kurt Barlow''' is a [[fictional character]] and main [[antagonist]] of [[Stephen King]]'s 1975 [[horror fiction|horror]] [[novel]], ''[['Salem's Lot]]''. The character is a [[Vampire_(Stephen_King)#Type_Ones|master vampire]], who terrorizes the small [[Maine]] town of Jerusalem's Lot. Although his true age is unknown, he claims to be ancient, so old that he predates the founding of [[Christianity]] by centuries.

==History==
==='' 'Salem's Lot''===
Before the events of the novel, it is suggested that Barlow's original name or [[Pseudonym|alias]] was '''Breichen''' and that he was an [[Austria]]n nobleman. As Breichen, Barlow corresponded for twelve years with Hubert &quot;Hubie&quot; Marsten, a former [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[hitman]] living in the town of [[Jerusalem's Lot (Stephen King)|Jerusalem's Lot]], [[Maine]]. Marsten murdered his wife and committed suicide, but not before burning his letters with Barlow. The novel strongly implies that Marsten entered into an agreement with Barlow that allowed him to eventually come to Jerusalem's Lot.

In 1975, Barlow arrives in Jerusalem's Lot in a box shipped overseas by his human assistant, Richard Straker. The two take residence in Marsten's abandoned mansion, considered haunted by the townsfolk. Barlow and Straker pose as antiques dealers and open a shop in the town; Straker tends to the shop and handles business arrangements while Barlow is never seen in public; Straker tells inquiring visitors to the shop that Barlow is frequently on trips to buy antiques for the shop. Straker kidnaps a local boy, Ralphie Glick, and makes a [[human sacrifice]] of the child in an appeasement ritual. Ralphie's brother, Danny, becomes a vampire and begins to infect other locals.

Barlow makes his first appearance in the book when he encounters Dud Rogers, a hunchbacked dump custodian. Barlow also comes upon Corey Bryant, a young telephone worker who has been tortured and ordered to leave town by Reggie Sawyer, the man Bryant was cuckolding. Knowing their desires, Barlow claims Rogers and Bryant as his first victims.

Danny Glick later pays a night-time visit to one of his schoolmates, Mark Petrie. However, Mark, an intelligent and resourceful child, identifies Glick as a vampire and drives him off with a plastic cross. Mark sneaks into the Marsten House the next day with Susan Norton, intending to kill Barlow. However, they are both captured by Straker; Susan is bitten by Barlow and becomes a vampire, but Mark manages to escape, mortally wounding Straker in the process. Straker is later found hanging upside down, having been drained of his blood by Barlow. Petrie informs Susan's boyfriend, writer Ben Mears, of Susan's fate, and becomes part of the effort to kill the town's vampires, together with Ben, the Catholic priest [[Father Callahan]], doctor Jimmy Cody and the Lot's high school English teacher, Matt Burke. 

When Father Callahan and Mark head over to Mark's parents to explain the danger the family is in, the power is suddenly cut and Barlow appears. He kills Mark's parents by smashing their heads together, but does not infect them. Barlow then takes Mark hostage briefly. Callahan pulls out his cross in an attempt to drive him off, and for a time it works, until Barlow challenges him to throw away the cross. Callahan, not having faith enough to do so, is soon overwhelmed by Barlow, who takes the now-useless cross and snaps it in two. Barlow then forces Callahan to drink his vampire blood, making him &quot;unclean&quot;.

By now Mark has escaped, part of Barlow's deal with Callahan, and has fled to warn the others. At the end of the book, Barlow is killed by Ben Mears and Mark Petrie in the basement of Eva Miller's boarding house.

===''Dark Tower''===
In the [[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]] series, it is revealed that Barlow is a type one vampire, capable of hibernating for centuries and is highly intelligent and cunning. However, he seems to appear more human than the other type one vampires.

==Novel adaptations==
===1979 Miniseries===
[[Image:RutgerBarlow1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Rutger Hauer]] as Barlow, climbing the celling in ''[['Salem's Lot (2004 TV mini-series)|'Salem's Lot]]'' (2004)]]
In ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'' (1979), Barlow was significantly different from his novel counterpart; while Kurt Barlow in the novel resembles an ordinary human being, in the 1979 mini-series, he is depicted with a grotesque [[Nosferatu]]-like appearance. Interestingly enough, in ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', it is mentioned in the beginning that &quot;Type One&quot; vampires (such as Barlow) are horribly disfigured, [[mutant]]-like creatures whose teeth grow out so wildly that they cannot close their mouths.

This version of Barlow has a variety of [[supernatural]] powers, such as [[telekinesis]]; he opens a locked cell door with a wave of his hand, moves his own coffin along with the crate (which is unnaturally freezing cold to the touch) that it is inside, and causes the Petries' entire house to shake before entering.

===1995 radio drama===
In the 1995 [[Salem's Lot (radio drama)|BBC radio dramatization]] of '' 'Salem's Lot'', Barlow was voiced by [[Doug Bradley]].

===2004 Miniseries===
In [['Salem's Lot (2004 TV mini-series)|the 2004 miniseries adapted from the novel]], Barlow is portrayed by [[Rutger Hauer]]. He is a sophisticated, well-dressed older gentleman and, at first glance, his only difference from the rest of the community is his mildly anachronistic appearance (his dress and behavior seem to come from an earlier time). As opposed to the Nosferatu-type creature that Barlow was portrayed as in the 1979 mini-series, this portrayal is more in keeping with King's original source novel.

==Straker==
'''Richard Throckett Straker''' was Barlow's 'familiar' or human [[thrall]]. All of Barlow's business concerns are enacted by him. He bought the Marsten house and prepared the way for his master. After Mark Petrie wounded Straker during his escape from the Marsten house, Straker was drained of his blood by Barlow who was unable to resist feeding on his servant's freshly spilled blood. Barlow was furious at this turn of events, as he considered Straker the best servant he had ever possessed.
[[Image:MasonStrakerSalem79.png|185px|thumb|left|[[James Mason]] as Straker, in ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'' (''1979'').]]
In ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'' (1979), Straker was the main antagonist and a more prominent villain than Barlow, unlike the novel, and was alive until the climax of the mini-series. Though seemingly human, this version of Straker turns out to be something more with incredible strength, and it is implied he possesses some kind of supernatural power; he manages to summon a fast wind as he abducts Ralphie Glick in the woods and easily manages to lift Dr. Bill Norton off the ground by himself with little effort, as he impales him on a wall filled with animal horns. He was, however, still mortal and was shot and killed by Ben Mears on the stairs of the Marsten house, though he took several bullets to the abdomen and continued to move until finally succumbing to his wounds. Straker was English in this version (as played by [[James Mason]]) and came from London. His name, according to Constable Gillespie, was actually Richard ''K.'' Straker, though it remains unknown what the middle initial stood for.

In the BBC radio adaptation, Straker was played by [[John Moffatt (actor)|John Moffatt]].

[[Image:Sutherlandsalemslot 4.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Donald Sutherland]] as Straker, in ''[['Salem's Lot (2004 TV mini-series)|'Salem's Lot]]'' (''2004'').]]
In ''[['Salem's Lot (2004 TV mini-series)|'Salem's Lot]]'' (2004), Straker's name is once again changed, this time into Richard ''Thomas'' Straker. He was portrayed by [[Donald Sutherland]]. Although he again has more screen time than Barlow in this version, his role is somewhat reduced from that of the original mini-series. He is also never actually seen in any of the same scenes with Barlow. In this version, he is killed as in the novel and left hanging upside down from the rafters of the Marsten house, drained of his blood. However, it is unclear if he was killed by Barlow, since it is established in the 2004 mini-series that the house itself has some kind of evil entity dwelling inside it that had previously killed Hubie Marsten in a similar way.

Tracy is the daughter of [[Ray Langton]] ([[Neville Buswell]]) and [[Deirdre Barlow]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). Tracy never had much to do with her father and was later adopted by Deirdre's new husband [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]). Early storylines featuring Tracy concentrated on her childhood. She went on to feature in storylines about drugs, various family crises, relationships with [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]) and [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]), a feud with [[Karen McDonald]] ([[Suranne Jones]]), and a short-lived marriage to [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Julian Kay]]). Her exit storyline in 2007 was the culmination of a storyline that saw the character imprisoned for [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]]'s ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]) murder. In the on-screen events, Tracy was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Her brief return in May 2010 saw the character lie about [[Gail Platt|Gail McIntyre]] ([[Helen Worth]]) confessing to murdering husband [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe McIntyre]] ([[Reece Dinsdale]]). Her return in December 2010 saw her released from prison after forensic evidence used at her trial was discredited, and getting her daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney) back and attempting to steal Steve from his wife [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]) and failing; resulting in them both having a feud. Tracy also sparked a feud with [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]), which worsened after it transpired that Tina had kissed [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]). Rob would later murder Tina and after discovering this, Tracy and Rob's sister, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), turned him in and he was arrested, sparking a new feud between them both. Tracy's ex-husband, [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), also returned with Tracy going on to briefly reunite with him.

==Storylines==

===1977–1999===
Tracy is the daughter of [[Ray Langton|Ray]] ([[Neville Buswell]]) and [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]), born in 1977. Ray leaves when Tracy is a baby and she is raised by her mother and stepfather, [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]), who adopts her.

Ken and Deirdre separate in December 1989 when Ken has an affair with [[Wendy Crozier]] (Roberta Kerr), his secretary at the Weatherfield Recorder. Initially Tracy supports Deirdre, but above all else Tracy wants a return to family life. Once Ken sees the error of his ways and begins seeking a reconciliation, in opposition to Deirdre who wants a divorce, Tracy's allegiance shifts to Ken. Deirdre is subjected to further resentment when she takes up with joiner Dave Barton (David Beckett), who rescues Tracy when she accidentally sets the kitchen on fire. The divorce even affects Tracy's school life as Ken gets a teaching job there in 1990, as he can stay updated on Deirdre's exploits through Tracy. Caught between two warring parents, Tracy starts to rebel by playing truant from school, going instead to the amusement arcade with [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) and [[List of Coronation Street characters|Andy McDonald]] ([[Nicholas Cochrane]]). The year also sees Tracy get her first boyfriend, Graham Egerton (Paul Aspden), but it does not last long and they end their relationship.

Tracy meets carpet fitter, [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Julian Kay]]), and they decide to marry. They intend to tie the knot in London, where they are living but on telling Ken and Deirdre the news, Tracy decides to marry in Weatherfield instead, on the cheap; she books the Registry Office immediately and buys a £14 wedding dress from a charity shop. The wedding is a success and the Prestons return to London. Tracy visits Weatherfield three times over the next few years: she comes to Deirdre and Jon Lindsay's ([[Owen Aaronovitch]]) engagement party in 1997 and approves of airline pilot Jon (who is really a [[Confidence trick|confidence]] man), and then two years later, seeks refuge in Weatherfield after falling out with Robert, who accused Tracy of having an affair with her friend Dan after he saw them kissing. Robert follows Tracy to Weatherfield and they reconcile when he accepts her story that she and Dan are just friends. Tracy is delighted when her parents finally reconcile.

===2002–2007===
Tracy returns on Christmas Day 2002, claiming that Robert has cheated on her but it emerges that she was sleeping with Robert's best friend; so she and Robert divorce. Tracy has a brief fling with [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) but when she realises Dev thinks she is not &quot;marriage material&quot;, she dumps him before cutting up his suits and stealing his credit card.

Tracy places a bet with [[Bev Unwin]] ([[Susie Blake]]) that she can sleep with married [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]). She spikes his drink and then claims they slept together when he wakes up in her bed the next morning. Roy is racked with guilt and his partner [[Hayley Cropper|Hayley]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) is heartbroken and when Tracy discovers she is pregnant, she threatens to have an abortion unless the Croppers buy the baby for £15,000. With Hayley being a [[transsexual]], they agree, much to the disgust of Tracy's family. The Croppers worry Tracy will flee with their money and the child so Roy marries Tracy to gain legal rights to the baby. After delivering her daughter, whom the Croppers name Patience, Tracy wants her baby back and admits at Steve and [[Karen McDonald|Karen Phillips]]'s ([[Suranne Jones]]) wedding that Steve is the biological father, not Roy and she lied about them having sex. Not surprisingly, this causes a feud between her and Karen but Roy is persuaded by Ken to return Tracy's baby, whom she renames Amy. 
 
Tracy taunts Karen when she does not get pregnant as quickly as Tracy did, calling her &quot;Barren&quot; Karen. Karen does get pregnant but miscarries soon after in December 2004. Karen struggles to cope and finds Tracy's sympathy harder to cope with than her taunting, leading her to steal and torch Tracy's car. Tracy is devastated, thinking Amy is dead because she was in the car, and angrily goes after Karen, threatening to kill her. Only Steve's insistence that Amy is safe with Roy and Hayley, makes Tracy stop and he ends his marriage to Karen, reminding her that he is grieving too and could have lost two children. Tracy watches triumphantly as Karen leaves on Boxing Day 2004 and Steve tries to reconcile with Tracy but realises he wants Amy, not her. This leads to a bitter custody battle, with Tracy making it look as if Steve tried to kidnap Amy and even accusing him of abusing her. While Tracy wins primary custody, the judge does not believe her accusations and allows Steve visits with his daughter.

Short-lived flings with [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) and [[Nathan Harding]] ([[Ray Fearon]]) follow, until Tracy starts to date builder [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] in late 2005. However, Charlie has a one-night stand with his former girlfriend, [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]), ultimately resulting in her pregnancy. Though Tracy forgives Charlie, he betrays her again with [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]). Tracy concocts a plan for revenge, spreading lies that Charlie is abusing her while suggesting to Charlie that she is cheating. When Charlie decides to throw Tracy out, she announces her intention to kill him, which he does not believe. On 12 January 2007 she seduces him, then hits him twice on the head with a metal ornament, taunting him as she does; she tries to convince the police that it was self-defence but fails and is charged with murder after Charlie dies. Tracy is released on bail and [[David Platt (Coronation Street character)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) gives the police a statement, claiming to have witnessed the murder in return for sleeping with Tracy, which she does, desperate to avoid going to prison. He lies under oath but his evidence is dismissed by the court and, following Tracy's confession to Deirdre that the murder was planned, Deirdre is unconvincing as a witness. Consequently, Tracy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 15 years before parole. In financial ruin, Ken and Deirdre cannot pay for an appeal, leaving Tracy to serve her sentence.

===2010–===
Tracy is allowed a day release from prison to attend [[Blanche Hunt]]'s ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]) funeral, while at the funeral she argues with Steve's wife, [[Becky McDonald|Becky]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]). A few months later, Tracy returns to the Street. She tells the Barlows that the expert who handled the forensic evidence for her trial falsified his qualifications so she has been released on bail, pending a retrial. Tracy is found not guilty at the retrial, owing to the unreliability of forensic evidence. On New Years Eve 2010, Tracy is found unconscious with a head injury, she survives and it later announced it was Becky's friend [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) who pushed her.

In 2011, Tracy has a one-night stand with Steve and they begin a relationship, Steve later proposes to Tracy and they plan to get married. Tracy later finds out she is pregnant with twins but after an argument with Becky she falls down the stairs she loses the twins however Tracy decides to put the blame on Becky telling Steve that Becky pushed her however when he goes against her she manages to get hold of Tracy's medical records and reveals them to everyone at Steve and Tracy's wedding in January 2012 leading to them both breaking up and Becky leaving to go to [[Barbados]].

Tracy begins dating [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]). Rob and Tracy then buy the bookmakers' and turn it into a pawnbroker's shop. Tracy is furious when [[Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) tells her that Rob kissed [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]), and that [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), his sister knew about it. Tracy attacks Tina, but is stopped by Rob. A public argument between Rob, Tracy, Tina and Carla erupts. Tracy later forgives Rob, and they decide to get engaged. Rob and Tracy then get involved with [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), who gives the couple illegal products to sell at their shop. Despite Rob wanting to stop the questionable dealings, Tracy continues trading with Tony.

Rob and Tracy decide to hold an engagement party at ''[[The Rovers Return]]''. During the party, Carla announces that she is pregnant with Peter's baby, just as Tina, whom Peter has been having an affair with, walks in. Tracy insults Carla and her unborn child, which infuriates her. A distraught Tina runs home, followed by Rob. Tracy then leaves the party to do more dealings with Tony, while Peter admits to Carla that he has been having an affair with Tina. Carla then runs out into the pub, exclaiming that she wants to &quot;kill&quot; Tina for sleeping with Peter behind her back. Elsewhere, Rob attacks Tina in her own home, leading to her running to the balcony, where the argument continues. He tries to persuade Tina not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter&amp;nbsp;– unaware that Peter has told her himself&amp;nbsp;– to save her feelings, and threatens her not to say anything to the police about their dealings with Tony. Tina refuses, so as Rob pushes her away, Tina loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob believes that Tina is dead, so leaves her flat panic-stricken. He then hears Tina's groans, and realises that she is still alive. Tina threatens to tell the police that Rob pushed her from the balcony on purpose, in an attempt to kill her. This pushes Rob over the edge, leading to him picking up a metal pipe and beating her with it.

Tracy is happy that Tina has been hospitalised, as she hated her. When Tina dies, however, she is slightly more sympathetic. Tracy believes that Carla murdered Tina, but Rob tries to persuade her that Peter killed her. When Rob begins acting strangely, Tracy is concerned and he begins to push her out of his life. Rob confesses to Carla that it was he who killed Tina, not Peter, who has now been sentenced to life in prison for her murder. Carla is unsure of what to do but the following morning she sees how upset Peter's family is and calls the police. Rob then runs from the scene, leaving Tracy devastated. Tracy believes it is Carla's fault for not keeping quiet, and attacks her as the police arrive. She is then questioned by the police for providing a false [[alibi]] for Rob, as she had previously told them they were together at her house at the time of Tina's murder, to cover up the fact that she was really buying stolen goods from Tony. Tracy confesses to giving a false alibi, but still will not believe Rob is the murderer. The next day, Rob calls her from a [[bed and breakfast|B&amp;B]], admits to killing Tina but claims he did it to keep them both out of jail. He tells Tracy he is running out of money and Tracy agrees to bring some to him, which she takes out of their wedding cards. Tracy and Rob meet, she gives him the money but upon saying goodbye decides she wants to go on the run with him. They plan for her to collect their things and meet the following evening. She meets Rob and he says they have to get away quickly, but Tracy cries and tells him she is sorry. She has called the police and told them where he would be, as she realised she could not leave Amy, and knew as well that she did not want to be in prison again. Rob is shocked and devastated, telling her she had a choice, and she could have chosen him. He is led away by police, leaving a sobbing Tracy behind. Tracy later reveals to Ken that she believes it is Carla's fault that Rob murdered Tina.

In early 2015, Tracy starts an affair with Tony who is in a relationship with Amy's grandmother [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) but tells Liz about it before Steve and [[Michelle Connor]]s ([[Kym Marsh]]) wedding in which she becomes more jealous about Carla and seeks revenge, that night Tracy sneaks into Carla's flat and tried killing her however she hears someone go to the toilet, who unbeknown to her is Amy, and leaves a candle which she lit to guide her way around the flat near a lamp and runs out causing a fire, [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) sees the fire and breaks into the flat and manages to get Carla out before her fiancé [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]) arrives and manages to get Amy and Leanne out before the flat explodes killing him and also [[Maddie Heath]]. As Tracy is nowhere to be seen everyone blames Carla for the fire, making Tracy happy.

In July 2015, Tracy is distraught when Deirdre dies. At Deirdre's funeral, Ken snaps at her after learning that his late wife wouldn't come home as she felt ashamed of what Tracy's done. Tracy storms out and her ex-husband [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] (now played by [[Tristan Gemmill]]) follows. Back at the house, Robert and Tracy admit there's still feelings between each other and Tracy tries to seduce him. However, Ken decides to give Tracy another chance and goes round to sort things out, only to find Robert and Tracy half dressed, he throws Robert out and lashes out at a guilt-stricken Tracy. Ken later argues with Tracy saying she was the reason Deirdre didn't come home. When Carla contemplates suicide by jumping from a cliff Tracy tells her it was her who started the fire.

Tracy later opens her own florist and calls it &quot;Prestons Petals&quot; in a bid to win Robert back however she later finds out Robert slept with Carla and she threatens her. She then blackmails Carla to get her fiancée [[Nick Tilsley|Nick]] ([[Ben Price]]) to hand over his business to her, give her money and get out of the country or she will tell Nick. She does this but Tracy forever taunts her. On Carla's wedding day, Tracy sends the flowers to the wrong place and Carla's dad [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) finds out about this. To stop her ruining the wedding, he asks her to meet him for him to give her money and call a 'truce'. However Tracy declines and when looking for her money Johnny locks her in the cupboard. She manages to escape by setting the fire alarm off and tells everyone at the wedding about what has happened. Nick says that Carla has already told him embarrassing Tracy but he doesn't know about the blackmailing, they still get married but unknown to Tracy, Nick regrets it and walks out leaving Carla in tears, looking for revenge. Robert finishes with Tracy when Nick hits him. The only person who stands by her is Ken as Amy doesn't want to see her. Carla attempts to run Tracy over however in doing so she causes herself a crash and also causes a truck to have a crash. Everyone then leaves her apart from Ken. Carla comes to tell her that their feud is over before leaving. Tracy later collapses due to her kidney and is hospitalised. After being discharged from hospital Ken suffers a stroke himself but stops Tracy and Peter from seeing him as he believes it was the stresses of them which caused him to have the stroke. She later begins pretending to be seeing [[Luke Britton]] (Dean Fagan) but after her 40th birthday when Tracy opens up to him, they begin to see each other properly and he gives her a necklace.

In March 2017, Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown person however the police suspect that one of his close family members, including Tracy was the one who tried murdering him after Ken fell out with most of them before. Tracy opens his [[will and testament|will]] whilst he is in hospital and finds out that she has been left nothing by him, but unknown to her, Ken changed it and was given everything to her. After Luke breaks up with her due to suspicion he believes something it going on with her Tracy meets with Rob who is out of prison somehow and it becomes apparent she was with him the night Ken was pushed.

==Casting==
[[File:TracyBarlow1.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Christabel Finch (right) and Holly Chamarette (left) as Tracy Barlow.]]
Tracy was created as the daughter of [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) and [[Ray Langton]] ([[Ray Langton]]). The first actress to play Tracy was Christabel Finch in 1977, who first appeared in the role when she was 15 days old. According to Finch in 2007, &quot;It was a case of being the right baby, in the right place, at the right time. The casting director came to the baby unit and picked me at random, then asked my parents if I could be in the show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2007/03/30/four-faces-of-tracy-115875-18831099/|title= Four faces of Tracy|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|first=Damien|last=Fletcher|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=30 March 2007| accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Finch reflected on her time in the soap, remembering that she used to share a dressing room with Anne Kirkbride who plays Tracy's mother Deirdre and one of her most prominent storyline memories is her involvement in Deirdre's affair with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]): &quot;Because I was a kid, everyone was really friendly to me. [[Julie Goodyear]], who played [[Bet Gilroy]], was really lovely and a very down-to-earth person. The biggest plot I was involved in was when Deirdre had an affair with Mike Baldwin. There was a lot of shouting going on and Ken was screaming at her, 'Get out of the house!' I just thought, 'what's going on, why are they shouting?'&quot; Finch left the role when she was seven as her parents had opted to move to Guernsey.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+soaps'+lost+children%3b+HOW+YOUNG+STARS+COPED+WHEN+AXE+FELL+ON+FAME.-a073966802|title= The soaps' lost children; How young stars coped when axe fell on fame|first=Mark|last=Christie|first2=Ben|last2=Gelbulm|last3=Bunce|first3=Tracie|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=2 May 2001|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was two years until the producers recast Tracy. On screen during that time, Tracy's parents Ken and Deirdre would say that Tracy was either in her room upstairs or at school.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt; Eight-year-old Holly Chamarette was given the role in 1985. At the time she reportedly commented, &quot;I'm thrilled. I've been watching Coronation Street for ages.&quot; She was chosen from more than 60 children, but left the role when she was 11 in 1988, quitting the acting profession to become a doctor.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;

The third actress to play the part was Dawn Acton, appearing between 1988 and 1999. Acton was 11 when she took on the role and played the character through her teenage years, in what Acton has described as Tracy's tarty phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;lost&quot;/&gt; Acton has said that Tracy's appearances became rare in the mid 1990s, until the casting director James Bain informed her that her contract was not being renewed as &quot;the storylines involving Tracy had dried up&quot;. Acton adds, &quot;I was 17 but I wasn't devastated. There were no tantrums, like the ones Tracy was famous for. James said I should try other things in the acting world. I did&amp;nbsp;– but it didn't work out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lost&quot;/&gt;

In November 2002, it was reported that Dawn Acton reauditioned for the role of Tracy but was unsuccessful which resulted in the role being given to [[Kate Ford]]. A spokeswoman for the soap said: &quot;[Kate] is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially in the past four years and really hits the ground running. Kate is thrilled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a9591/dawn-acton-fails-to-win-back-street-role.html|title= Dawn Acton fails to win back 'Street' role|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|date=12 November 2002|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing why Acton was not brought back, a spokesperson said, &quot;We [looked] at other actresses because the character has changed so much—she's going to be explosive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/displayarticle.php?id=9406|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20021226015541/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk:80/displayarticle.php?id=9406|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 26 December 2002|title=Tracy Barlow back on the street -- as a maneater|first=Neil|last=Wilkes|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=23 October 2002| accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was a fan of the show as a child, and revealed that when she was 12, she wrote around ten letters to the casting director requesting a part.&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/katefordinterview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424143119/http://www.itv.com:80/soaps/coronationstreet/news/katefordinterview/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=24 April 2010|title=Tracy has toughened up!|date=21 April 2010|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is portrayed as being extremely selfish and dangerous. She appears to be a tough, fiery and very bitchy character, with actress Kate Ford stating that &quot;underneath she does care about her daughter which does show a soft side to her&quot;.

==Development==

===Reintroduction (2002)===
On 23 October 2002, it was reported that Tracy would be reintroduced later that year. A show spokesman says the new Tracy will be sexy, sassy and opinionated. She will make a beeline for womanising bookie [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]), her own stepbrother, before moving on to former sailor [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) and knicker factory boss [[Joe Carter]] (Jonathan Wrather). Tracy returns home to Weatherfield at Christmas after turning to mum Deirdre when her marriage breaks down - she left the Street after marrying [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Julian Kay]]) at Weatherfield Register Office. The character was last played by [[Dawn Acton]]. A ''Coronation Street'' spokesman said: &quot;We are looking at other actresses because the character has changed so much - she's going to be explosive.&quot; Explaining the decision to bring Tracy back as an anti-hero, writer [[Daran Little]] commented: &quot;You only have to look at a character whose parents got divorced when she was very young and then pulled either way to find out this woman is very flawed and has a chip on her shoulder. So you take that and bring her back a few years later as a very selfish person.&quot; On 13 November 2002, it was announced that [[Kate Ford]] had been cast as Tracy. It was reported that Acton was said to be &quot;devastated&quot; when she failed to win the part which Instead went to Ford. But whereas Tracy Barlow was a glum-faced teenager, Tracy Preston - as she is now called - is a sexy, sassy and opinionated man-eater. At the same time it was also reported that Tracy would sleep with her mother's former flame [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]). A ''Coronation Street'' spokeswoman said Ford, fresh from London's Webber Douglas Academy but originally from north Lancashire, was &quot;thrilled&quot; to have landed the role. &quot;She is very excited to have got the part. The character has changed substantially in the past four years and really hits the ground running. Kate is thrilled.&quot; Tracy returned on screen on 25 December 2002, and she spent no time moping over her failed marriage. &quot;She's been bored in London and she's ready to let her hair down and have some fun. Tracy's a strong, feisty woman and I think at last Dev may have met his match.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrie.net/kabin/archive/2002/2002_4.html The Weatherfield Recorder - back issues, Oct - Dec 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy===
A storyline involving Tracy in 2003 saw her have a one-night stand with [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]) and wanted to take things further but Steve got back together with his wife [[Karen McDonald|Karen]] ([[Suranne Jones]]) instead. In need of an ego boost, Tracy bet [[Bev Unwin]] ([[Susie Blake]]) 1p that she could bed [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]), to prove that she could have any man she wanted. Tracy won the bet by subterfuge - drugging Roy. A few weeks later Tracy found out she was pregnant and booked an abortion. Her original intent was to keep quiet but, when confronted by a furious [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]), Tracy blurted out that she was pregnant with Roy's baby. As Roy and Hayley couldn't have children and longed for one, Tracy suggested that they adopt her baby for £20,000. The Croppers agreed but tried to persuade Tracy to marry Roy to guarantee his parental rights. Faced with a legal bill from her divorce from Robert, Tracy agreed, marrying Roy with Hayley and [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) as their witnesses. David Neilsen who plays Roy said: &quot;Roy really loves Hayley and he doesn't want to marry someone else, especially not Tracy. As far as Roy and Hayley are concerned, ever since their blessing they've been man and wife, Inside Roy hates himself for this because what they are doing goes against all his morals, but he is desperately trying to be strong for Hayley. Roy gets himself so worked up, he is actually physically sick. If they ever found out that the baby wasn't theirs it would absolutely devastate the Croppers. They have put their hearts and souls into this baby coming into the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-201681/Tracey-comes-Cropper.html#ixzz4DL9l5qJs Tracey comes a 'Cropper' | Daily Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the storyline saw Tracy give birth to baby daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] in February 2004, who was revealed to be Steve's child and not Roy's, leaving Tracy to later go on to have a feud with Steve's wife Karen.

===Departure (2007)===
In 2005, Ford made the decision to leave the serial but after being promised of more &quot;juicier storylines&quot; Ford decided to stay. In January 2006, it was reported by the ''[[News of the World]]'', that Ford had again insisted that she will bow out next year when her contract expires. A ''Coronation Street'' spokesman told ''[[Digital Spy]]'': &quot;Kate is contracted until next Spring so she's with us for the foreseeable future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a34017/kate-ford-i-will-leave-corrie.html#ixzz3gqBDKXgc Kate Ford: &quot;I WILL leave Corrie&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]] who plays [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]], the boyfriend of Tracy announced his departure from the serial in June 2006, an ''[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'' spokesperson commented: “Contrary to press reports Bill’s decision to leave is not linked to the future of the character of Tracy Barlow. Actress Kate Ford is contracted to ''Coronation Street'' until March 2007.” After months of speculation, Ford announced in August 2006 that she is to quit the show next year. Talking of her decision to leave, she told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'': &quot;It has been the best time of my life, playing Tracy Barlow. I cannot wait to see what the writers have got in store for her.” Producer Steve Frost confirmed that Tracy would not be killed off in her exit. “Kate will be involved in a major storyline which will see her leave next spring,&quot; he said. &quot;Kate is a great asset. Her character Tracy has left the cobbles before and we hope she’ll return one day.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a35465/kate-ford-to-quit-corrie-in-the-spring.html#ixzz3gqCjeg3B Kate Ford to quit Corrie in the spring&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced that Tracy would kill Charlie as part of Ford and Ward's leaving storylines which saw Tracy sentenced to life imprisonment for Charlie's murder. [[Brian Capron]] who played killer [[Richard Hillman]] from 2001 to 2003 warned Ford and Ward that the murder plot could harm their careers due to the storyline being a high-profile storyline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a41876/capron-worries-about-kate-ford-bill-ward.html#ixzz3gqEhT2mo Capron worries about Kate Ford, Bill Ward&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ford promised that it’s a fitting end for the Street's resident love rat. &quot;Charlie has had this smug attitude that he can do whatever he wants and it has just driven Tracy insane,&quot; she said. &quot;He lives by the sword and dies by the sword. I don’t think there's a man Tracy’s met who's going to get the better of her. She hates what he's turned her into and wants him to die after he continually cheated on her.&quot; Bill Ward commented: &quot;He doesn’t believe that Tracy would actually go through with murder and thinks himself much smarter. &quot;Charlie has long suspected that Tracy was concocting something evil, and when she reveals her wicked plans he challenges her to go through with it. He doesn’t believe she would actually go through with it for a second, so when Tracy actually goes for him it’s a complete shock. She attacks him with such ferocity that he doesn’t stand a chance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a41513/in-pictures-tracys-vicious-attack-on-charlie.html#~pjo6WkzNhQGbUk In Pictures: Tracy's vicious attack on Charlie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline saw Tracy spending weeks staging arguments, locking herself in the house, and even burning herself with an iron, in order to convince neighbour [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) that Charlie is abusing her. Ken and Deirdre are also concerned for Tracy's well-being, but she will not leave Charlie. Tracy gives Charlie a lap dance and begins to tell him they will be together forever. While he is distracted, she hits him over the head with a heavy metal sculpture. She taunts him and then hits him again, with a fatal blow. This resulted in Charlie ending up in hospital in a [[coma]]. Tracy, meanwhile, is successfully granted bail following an intense grilling by detectives. She ignores her bail conditions and sneaks to the hospital where she leans over an unconscious Charlie urging him to hurry up and die. “When Tracy finds out that Charlie hasn’t died straight away she's terrified that he might actually wake up and tell the cops the truth,&quot; Ford revealed. &quot;She planned to kill him so knowing he's still alive puts her into a panic. She orders Deirdre to take her to the hospital where she wishes her cheating boyfriend would hurry up and die. It’s a really worrying time for Tracy as she's desperate to cover her tracks and not be charged with murder. Ford added: “As far as Tracy’s concerned Charlie was trying to kill her and that’s what she has told everybody. But if Charlie comes to and tells the truth, Tracy will almost certainly be done for attempted murder.” Charlie later ends up dying in hospital much to the relief of Tracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a41572/tracy-wishes-charlie-a-speedy-death.html#~pjo91FSlPUJVB1 Tracy wishes Charlie a speedy death&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coronation Street'' broadcast an episode on 25 March 2007, which only featured Ford and [[Anne Kirkbride]] who played Tracy's mum [[Deirdre Barlow]], this was the first episode to feature only two actors since [[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]] and [[Sarah Lancashire]] who played [[Curly Watts|Curly]] and [[Raquel Watts]] in 2000. The episode saw Tracy confess all to Deirdre. Speaking of the episode, Ford said: &quot;Deirdre’s been asking questions and Tracy knows she’s onto her. Also Tracy’s feeling the pressure and she needs to confide in someone after keeping it to herself for so long. It’s all too much, so when the big confrontation comes Tracy lets go and confesses to Deirdre that she murdered Charlie in cold blood. She feels like she wants to take the weight off her. For months she’s been carrying round this big secret and she needs to offload it, especially now Deirdre’s sniffing around. Also, Deirdre intimates that she would lie for her so Tracy’s quite confident that she can freely offload.&quot; Ford added: &quot;She forces her word that she won’t tell anyone and that she’ll back her in court, but Deirdre’s wavering. She’s appalled and wants Tracy to come clean, but she’s also her child, her own flesh and blood, so it’s hard to consider giving her up. Tracy expects that as her mum Deirdre will stick by her whatever. It was amazing to be able to do an entire episode just with the two of us. I love working with Anne and this was a fantastic opportunity to explore the relationship between the two of them.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a44204/corries-tracy-comes-clean.html#ixzz3gqH9BYHm Corrie's Tracy comes clean&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy's trial aired in March 2007 and the jury delivered the &quot;guilty&quot; verdict, resulting in Tracy being sentenced to life imprisonment. Ford's final episode as Tracy was broadcast on 8 April 2007.

When asked by ''itv.com'' in 2013 whether Tracy would ever be driven to kill again, Ford replied: &quot;I don't think she ever wants to go back to prison, she absolutely hated it, so for that reason no. Also I think she was in such a dark place when she was with Charlie, I don't think she just killed him for the sake of it, she'd gone a bit mental because he was playing games with her head.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a452841/coronation-street-tracy-will-never-kill-again-says-kate-ford.html#ixzz3gtnXNT00 'Coronation Street' Tracy will never kill again, says Kate Ford&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reintroduction (2010)===
On 5 January 2010, it was announced that Ford would reprise the role of Tracy after more than three years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrity.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=151626189|title=Kate Ford to return to Corrie|date=5 January 2010|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress attributed her return in part to the 2009 return of her friend [[Shobna Gulati]] as [[Sunita Alahan]], and her desire to work with Gulati again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a216898/ford-gulati-was-the-reason-i-returned.html|title=Ford: 'Gulati was the reason I returned'|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=27 April 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford believes that the time she has spent in prison has made Tracy's attitude worse, characterising her as &quot;a bit cagey and a bit bitter&quot;. She stated that Tracy still loves Steve, but that his new wife Becky would beat her in a fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; Her first scenes were shown in May, when she returned for her grandmother Blanche's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a217852/potd-tracy-returns-in-coronation-street.html|title=Tracy returns in 'Coronation Street'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=7 May 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford found the scenes difficult to film, following the then recent death of [[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]] who played Blanche. She described Tracy as a more ruthless and extreme version of her grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Kate Ford.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Kate Ford admitted that she was nervous about her return to the serial.]]
Tracy returned to Weatherfield on a permanent basis later in 2010. The storyline depicting her initial return involved her being offered an early release in exchange for extracting a murder confession from Gail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a206345/shock-tracy-twist-ahead-for-corries-gail.html|title=Shock Tracy twist ahead for Corrie's Gail|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=3 March 2010|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She falsely accused Gail of her husband [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe's]] murder, by telling the police that she hit him with a [[rolling pin]], after Gail told her that she hid a rolling pin on top of a bedroom wardrobe in order to stop poor cook Joe from baking potato pie. The police subsequently found the rolling pin hidden in the house, making Tracy's lie appear true. Tracy decided to testify in court, alleging that Gail was guilty of murdering Joe; Gail was found not guilty of murder and Tracy was furious that she might not be let out early, thus throwing a chair across the room at two police officers who were involved in Gail's case. Later that day, Tracy was attacked by Gail's fellow inmates after they threw water at her and locked her in a cell and beat her up for being a &quot;grass&quot;. Tracy was hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a209963/more-corrie-prison-plot-details-revealed.html|title=More Corrie prison plot details revealed|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive producer [[Phil Collinson]] has revealed that Tracy's return will bring a few years' worth of storylines for her and many other characters in the soap, and that there is a possibility of Becky McDonald and Tracy appearing in a special [[two-hander]] episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s3/coronation-street/news/a278771/special-corrie-episode-for-tracy-becky.html|title=More Corrie prison plot details revealed|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed on 4 October, that Tracy would return on Christmas Eve 2010, following her shock release from prison. Speaking to ''Inside Soap'', Ford said: &quot;Tracy's absolutely ecstatic to be out of prison, and excited to be home. She's a bit nervous because she knows everybody is going to hate her - but she's basically the same old Tracy!&quot; Ford added: &quot;{{sic|nolink=y|Primarly}} she wants Amy back, but she'd like to be with Steve as well. She wants them to be a family. Steve is Tracy's true love, and she'd do anything to Becky if it meant she could have him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a292776/kate-ford-same-old-tracy-barlow-returns.html#~pjo1I69TAb92WU Kate Ford: 'Same old Tracy Barlow returns'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to ''Soaplife'' about Tracy's comeback, [[Simon Gregson]] who plays [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] explained: &quot;I'm really excited. Tracy's a brilliant character. You've got that lightness and then pure evil. And Kate (Ford) does such a good deadpan face. I sometimes have to struggle not to laugh. Her return is a massive shock. Steve instantly thinks, 'Oh no!' He just knows she'll be bringing him loads of flack.&quot; Discussing Tracy's demands for custody of Amy, Gregson continued: &quot;Tracy's got [Steve] over a barrel. It turns out Amy's heard Steve and [[Becky McDonald|Becky]] talking about buying Max and she's told Tracy. &quot;That's all the ammunition she needs. She tells Steve if she doesn't get custody she'll shop him and Becky to the authorities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corrieblog.tv/2010/12/coronation_stre_1387.html#sthash.hXMCFML3.dpuf Corrieblog.tv&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy returns just as the tram crash memorial service is taking place. By the end of Christmas Eve she has managed to alienate most of the community, particularly Gail McIntyre and the recently widowed Claire Peacock. On 30 December 2010, after Tracy has complained to Deirdre, Ken and Peter about being deprived of sex, David Platt confronts her at home about her conduct towards his mother. After a bitter argument, Tracy seduces David. Shortly afterward, Tracy sleeps with [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]); they are discovered by [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). On New Year's Eve, Deirdre and Ken find Tracy unconscious with a head injury. Suspicion falls on Steve, who is standing nearby with blood on his hands.

On 19 May 2011, Kate Ford revealed that the main thing driving her ''Coronation Street'' alter-ego Tracy Barlow is the desire to have a family with daughter Amy and former husband Steve McDonald. Speaking to TV Times, Ford said that Tracy is feeling as if her meddling is starting to pay off. &quot;She thinks she can see a shift in Steve, and she knows that his and Becky's relationship is not on firm ground. She's excited because she thinks an opportunity might be presenting itself,&quot; Ford explained. &quot;All Tracy wants is for her, Amy and Steve to be a family. She sees that as the key to her fulfilment and happiness. She does love Amy and she's really worried about her mystery illness. When it comes down to it, she will put Amy above anything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rainey|first=Naomi|title=Corrie's Kate Ford: 'Tracy wants a family'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a320325/corries-kate-ford-tracy-wants-a-family.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rob Donovan===
In December 2012, it was announced that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy begin a relationship with [[Rob Donovan]] (Marc Baylis) the brother of [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]). Speaking of the storyline a ''Coronation Street'' source said: &quot;Tracy and Rob are a match made in soap heaven, They will be fiery, passionate and out to cause trouble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a444125/coronation-street-tracy-barlow-to-date-rob-donovan.html#~oWVPETKHsbdWkQ 'Coronation Street' Tracy Barlow to date Rob Donovan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Baylis went on to say: &quot;Watch this space&amp;nbsp;– interestingly, Tracy Barlow comes onto his radar. [[File:Michelle Keegan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tracy was one of the suspects in the 'Who Killed Tina?' campaign as part of [[Michelle Keegan]]'s ''(pictured)'' departure which saw her character [[Tina McIntyre]] murdered.]]  That is an interesting combination. Without a doubt, he sees something of himself in Tracy and finds her intriguing!&quot; Ford admitted: &quot;She [Tracy] likes the fact that he's quite feisty&amp;nbsp;– it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a451572/coronation-street-star-on-tracy-rob-maybe-theyre-kindred-spirits.html#~oWVQHMVggJxb4U Coronation Street star on Tracy, Rob: 'Maybe they're kindred spirits'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about the kind of a dynamic between Rob and Tracy, Baylis told ''[[Digital Spy]]'': &quot;There's a lot of joyful banter - they challenge each other in a fun way. They're quite similar, they can see those similarities and they do have a lot of fun together. They put a smile on each other's faces, and we'll just have to see how it goes from there.&quot; Asked if Rob can hold his own when it comes to Tracy, Baylis replied: &quot;&quot;Definitely, otherwise he wouldn't get involved. He is aware of the whole situation that happened with Ryan last year, but he's got a few more years on Ryan and he's been round the block a few times. Rob definitely wouldn't get involved in something that he didn't think he could handle. But Rob does have an arrogant side, and he feels like he could deal with anything. That's one of Rob's main flaws. I've really enjoyed working with Kate Ford on the storyline - we've had an absolute blast. We've been working a lot together, and hopefully the working relationship that we've built up behind the scenes will come across on screen. I'm looking forward to seeing that unfold myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a449832/coronation-street-marc-baylis-talks-rob-carla-tracy-plots. 'Coronation Street': Marc Baylis talks Rob, Carla, Tracy plots&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how Rob first gets Tracy's attention, Ford told ''All About Soap'': &quot;Well, Tracy's going off shopping in town and she gets into a taxi at exactly the same time as Rob. She demands that he leave, as it's her taxi and not his. He refuses to move though, and when Steve asks them where they're going and they both say the city centre at the same time, they share a smile and end up going in the cab together. She likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!&quot; Ford also stated that not only is Tracy attracted to Rob, she realises that it would also annoy [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), adding: &quot;If he had got out of the taxi, she probably wouldn't have fancied him. He's quite easy on the eye too, of course. Plus, he hangs round with Michelle, and if Tracy and Rob were an item, it would annoy her - that's another good reason for Tracy.&quot; On Tracy's reaction to being asked out by Rob, she said: &quot;She's quite annoyed at first and she turns him down. But he persists and he flatters her, so she thinks, why not? I think he's like a nicer version of [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]), so maybe. He's got the bad lad streak, he's ruthless, but he's nowhere near as cruel as Charlie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a451572/coronation-street-star-on-tracy-rob-maybe-theyre-kindred-spirits.html#ixzz3gtmrRE4n Coronation Street star on Tracy, Rob: 'Maybe they're kindred spirits'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy convinces Rob to give her a job at ''Underworld'', and when factory boss [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) has doubts over the arrangement, the Tracy promises to behave herself. However, in an interview with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', Ford confirmed that Tracy won't be able to resist winding up her new co-workers. Ford explained: &quot;She loves to p*** everyone off. She annoys Michelle, she annoys [[Eva Price|Eva]] and she likes that.&quot; Discussing her alter ego's nasty nature, the Ford admitted: &quot;She is so vile. Sometimes when she is being really horrid, I ask everyone, 'Why is Tracy so horrible?' and they all go, 'Because she is horrid!' It's as if she is unhappy with her own life and so she is awful to everyone else. &quot;But I do love playing Tracy and I am always so grateful that I have been given this role. I have such a brilliant time on set and there are never any rows because we all have such a laugh.&quot; Ford also insisted that Tracy does have the potential to settle down with one man. She said: &quot;I will leave the writers to come up with the storylines for Tracy. But I do think she could stay with anybody - so long as they let her behave a little bit badly. The reason why she stayed with Charlie [Stubbs] is because she couldn't walk all over him. But who knows what will happen with Tracy in the future?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a454920/coronation-street-kate-ford-promises-more-tracy-rows.html#ixzz3gtoiqGof 'Coronation Street': Kate Ford promises more Tracy rows&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that Tracy will put her relationship with Rob before her own daughter as she tries to secure more commitment from him. Tracy decides that she wants to live with Rob, but she knows that he may need some convincing as he is not ready to be a stepfather to Amy. Tracy's interfering step-brother [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) is responsible for planting the idea in Tracy's head, questioning why she hasn't moved in with Rob now that they have a business together. Kate Ford, told ''itv.com'': &quot;It definitely strikes a nerve when Peter says that Rob will never see her that way and only cares about himself. Tracy is willing to do anything to move in with Rob, even if it means palming Amy off on Steve and her mum more often. She knows one of the reasons Rob's reluctant to move in with her is because he fears he won't be a good stepdad to Amy, and that's not really the life he wants right now. So to solve this problem, she persuades Steve to have Amy four nights a week and Deirdre the other three.&quot; Ford added: &quot;Tracy is very good at twisting people round her finger. Rob's got everything she wants in a man - he's ambitious and driven, he shares her ruthless streak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a501948/coronation-street-kate-ford-tracy-fights-to-move-in-with-rob.html#ixzz3gtsWWjp8 'Coronation Street' Kate Ford: 'Tracy fights to move in with Rob'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A twist in Tracy and Rob's relationship storyline happened when Rob later went to kiss [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Asked why they end up kissing each other, Baylis replied: &quot;They're playing games with each other. The thing with Rob is that he can't resist a challenge. He'll always rise to the bait, and Tina challenges him. They're both pushing each other while they are flirting and it's all about game playing. That's how it happens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a537057/coronation-streets-marc-baylis-rob-panics-after-tina-kiss.html#~pjrLo8Hh47et1B Coronation Street's Marc Baylis: 'Rob panics after Tina kiss'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy later finds out about their kiss and is furious, beginning a feud with her and Tina; which would later build up to the departure of Keegan and the murder of Tina for which Tracey was a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a534688/coronation-street-tracy-furious-after-tina-rob-discovery.html#~oWVRmvMG9hRuwh&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Ford, said: &quot;Tracy has committed murder before and got away with it and she certainly takes no prisoners when it comes to getting revenge on people who have wronged her. She has never really forgiven Tina for kissing Rob and trying to take him off her - and for her campaign to try and close down Barlow's Buys when they first opened. Now that she knows Tina has rumbled their dodgy dealings with [[Tony Stewart|Tony]], it may be that she thinks enough is enough and slips away from her engagement party to confront her - but Tina is every bit as feisty and Tracy might have bitten off more than she can chew trying to keep her quiet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a571684/coronation-street-confirms-tina-mcintyre-murder-suspects.html#ixzz3gtv4JMO8 Coronation Street confirms Tina McIntyre murder suspects&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that it wasn't Tracy who killed Tina and in fact it was Rob who killed her.

===Tony Stewart===
In December 2014, it was revealed that Tracy was to have an affair with [[Tony Stewart]] (Terrance Maynard) who is in a relationship with [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]). Maynard explained: &quot;Tracy is at her lowest ebb. She's broken and she needs validating in some way by a man. She's realized that she's all alone and she's not going to have a relationship with Rob as he's locked up for life. she thinks she'll be older and that nobody will be interested in her. Tony tells Tracy what she wants to hear, because he does feel for her. He tells her that she looks good, that there are loads of men that would want her. That's when Tracy turns to him and asks him if he'd go there with her. Tony refuses to answer and tells her he's with Liz and that he can't answer that question. Tony makes a point of telling Tracy he's happy with Liz and he puts his cards on the table. But Tracy still comes on strong because she needs this - this is something she needs to stabilise her. If she had a good friend that she could cry to and could go to, this might not be happening - but she needs a sexual validation, so it becomes about power.&quot; [[File:Beverley Callard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tracy was involved in an affair with [[Tony Stewart]] the boyfriend of [[Liz McDonald]] played by [[Beverley Callard]] ''(pictured)''.]]   Asked whether Tony pulls back when Tracy first tries to kiss him, Maynard replied: &quot;He tries to. When she starts kissing him, he is completely disengaged and tries to turn away from her. But there's no doubt about it that there's an attraction to Tracy and he can't deny it. With her coming on so strong, he can't help himself. I think he likes how much of a challenge she's becoming too. He feels lousy afterwards. I think he has concern for what will happen now and for what will happen with Liz. He hopes that's the end of it and that it won't spill out into the public domain. He genuinely loves Liz and he hasn't felt like this about a woman for a very long time so he doesn't want to lose it. He wants to just forget it and move on but it's evident that Tracy isn't going to let it go. From Tony's point of view it's about managing her and playing the game - he wants the business and that's still all he wants.&quot; Writers confirmed that the pair's romantic spark wouldn't be just be a one-off, so Tony's attraction to Tracy could grow as time goes on. Maynard added: &quot;He's not in love with her and they're not the same sort of feelings that he has for Liz, but I think he considers Tracy to be a friend of his and I think the feelings he does have for her could well grow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a614282/coronation-street-star-on-tonys-affair-tracy-comes-on-strong.html#~pdLVYOVR1pBBTX Coronation Street star on Tony's affair: 'Tracy comes on strong'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Ford said that Tracy could have met her match in Tony Stewart after he sets her up. Tracy agrees to go into business with Tony when he masterminds a situation that leaves her shaken, forcing her to reconsider her options. Tracy is left feeling threatened by a supplier after buying some dodgy stock, only to be rescued by Tony, who is hoping to finally get his hands on the business. Ford said: &quot;When it all goes wrong she's terrified. When he turns violent, she realises it could have gone massively wrong if Tony hadn't come in. She is quite good at protecting herself - she's been in prison so she can handle herself, but she is shaken.&quot; However, although Tracy believes she can keep Tony at arm's length once they become business partners, Ford thinks her alter ego could have her work cut out. She said: &quot;Tracy can kind of see through Tony. She is a big girl and she can look after herself. It's more about the money and the fact that she can't cope without him financially. She doesn't think of Tony as her saviour, it's all about the money. Tracy can be pretty ruthless herself so maybe she'll have to play Tony at his own game. I think she's going to have her work cut out though this time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a619545/coronation-streets-kate-ford-tracy-has-her-work-cut-out-with-tony.html#ixzz3gtzJaHok Coronation Street's Kate Ford: 'Tracy has her work cut out with Tony'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Liz later finds out about the affair when Tracy breaks the news to her on the day of [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] and [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]]'s wedding. [[Beverley Callard]], who plays [[Liz McDonald|Liz]], commented: &quot;At first Liz doesn't quite believe it. She's not concerned about the dodgy things that Tracy and Tony might get up to at Barlow's Buys, but she doesn't believe Tony would do anything else. Tracy then starts to show her texts which prove they've been having an affair. Liz still doesn't quite believe it, but she soon starts to realise there could be some truth to it. Tracy also tells Liz that they've been trying to get The Rovers from underneath her as well. That just puts the lid on it for Liz, but the one thing she's thinking is that she can't let it ruin the wedding day for Steve and Michelle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a648932/coronation-street-spoiler-video-tracy-tells-liz-everything.html#ixzz3gu0G55Xk Coronation Street spoiler video: Tracy tells Liz everything&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Preston===
On 10 May 2015, it was announced that [[Tristan Gemmill]] had been cast as Tracy's ex [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a646514/coronation-street-tristan-gemmill-cast-as-tracys-ex-robert-preston.html Coronation Street: Tristan Gemmill cast as Tracy's ex Robert Preston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Robert (then played by [[Julian Kay]]) had previously been married to Tracy when [[Dawn Acton]] was playing the role. It was announced that Robert will return to Tracy's life in the summer when he turns up unexpectedly at the funeral of her mum [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]). With Tracy grieving following her mother's sudden death and also newly-single after splitting from Tony Stewart, she quickly seeks comfort by falling back into Robert's arms. However, if Tracy harbours any hopes for a full reunion with Robert, it won't be easy for her as he is still married to his second wife - something he has neglected to tell her. Played by former ''[[Girls Aloud]]'' singer [[Sarah Harding]], Robert's wife quickly joins him in Weatherfield to fight for her man. Asked what Robert likes about Tracy, Gemmill replied: &quot;&quot;Now there's a question! I guess some people are attracted to broken people. I've got friends who have poor relationships by anyone's standards because they keep making the same mistake. Maybe Robert is one of those people who is attracted to danger, maybe he thinks he can fix her. There's an element of thrill being with someone who's unpredictable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a656959/coronation-street-spoilers-tracys-ex-robert-still-loves-her-says-newcomer-tristan-gemmill.html#ixzz3gu64YrZT Coronation Street spoilers: Tracy's ex Robert still loves her, says newcomer Tristan Gemmill&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidney infection===
On 16 May 2016, it was reported by the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy at &quot;death's door&quot; as her health will take a turn for the worse. It was also revealed that as she faces a fight for life, she may be doing so alone as all of her family will have turned their backs on her in the wake of her feud with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]). With Tracy only having one kidney, she will end up with an infection. Speaking to ''Metro.co.uk'' at a recent press event, [[Kate Ford]] explained: &quot;She gets an infection and the people that she thinks will be there for her aren’t and she realises she’s pushed everyone too far. There’ll be a big, bad karma – even her daughter who she took for granted doesn’t want to know. Even Ken has been pushed too far – although he does go and see her at the hospital, she is his daughter after all and she is at death’s door.&quot; Ford also hinted that the terror of the situation might make Tracy change her ways: &quot;It’s a different Tracy post-this, for quite some time. She realises she has cut off everybody – the health issue makes being conniving quite difficult! We won’t see as much of that in the future.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/16/coronation-street-spoilers-kate-ford-reveals-tracy-barlow-will-be-at-deaths-door-5886345/ Coronation Street spoilers: Kate Ford reveals Tracy Barlow will be at 'death's door' | Metro News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/coronation-street/tracy-s-rushed-to-hospital-in-corrie-and-kate-ford-reveals-whether-anyone-cares-331273/ Tracy collapses in pain but does anyone care? Corrie's Kate Ford&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Ford explained why Tracy only has one kidney: &quot;She has only got the one kidney because when she was younger she took an ecstasy tablet in a nightclub and had organ failure. The kidney she's got is [[Samir Rachid]]'s kidney&quot;. Ford also went on to explain the storyline in more detail: &quot;Tracy gets an infection in her kidney, which means that she becomes very poorly as it isn't functioning properly. She's been feeling pain for a while and feeling tired but she's been taking her medication, so isn't overly worried until she suddenly doubles over in agony in the flower shop. She tries to make light of it when she's referred to the transplant clinic, claiming as soon as she's ill, the doctors always presume it's her kidney. But deep down I think she's more worried than she's letting on.&quot; Discussing the aftermath of Tracy's subsequent collapse, Ford confirmed: &quot;Well she doesn't die! I think for Tracy the only positive that comes out of it is that she hopes it will bring her and [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] back together. But Amy is quite a tough cookie and she doesn't come to the hospital to see her, even though Tracy is on her deathbed. That really affects Tracy. She's desperate to try to make amends with Amy but it doesn't seem to work. She's very lonely and very emotional when she's at the hospital. Robert visits her and she's hopeful it means they have a future together, but it's not going to be that simple. Especially with Amy, who Tracy fears she may have lost forever.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a798530/coronation-street-spoilers-tracy-barlows-shocking-health-scare-revealed-as-she-suddenly-collapses/ Coronation Street spoilers: Tracy Barlow suffers a shock health scare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
When Tracy was blackmailed by David, Steven Perkins of [[Lowculture]] commented: &quot;It's very incredibly wrong, and yet they're both so vile that it goes right around the loop and goes back to being a thoroughly great idea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/02/23/soap-gaiety-update/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081112/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/02/23/soap-gaiety-update/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Soap gaiety update|last=Perkins|first=Steven|date=23 February 2007|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Lowculture contributor Nick Linsdell praised Tracy as &quot;one of the all-time great, completely horrific, self-absorbed soap monsters.&quot; He deemed her trial testament to the show's writers, as, even with a character who has been part of ''Coronation Street'' since birth: &quot;they've come up with an exit storyline that outdoes all her previous exploits and dragged in half the cast to enjoy the fun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/03/26/trial-stand-by-you/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081126/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/03/26/trial-stand-by-you/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Trial stand by you|last=Linsdell|first=Nick|date=26 March 2007|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins also praised the trial storyline, commenting: &quot;It makes for quite a nice change to have sat through a soap trial, knowing for once that The Accused was (a) guilty as sin, (b) acting in a deliberate, calculated and premeditated fashion and (c) not trying to frame someone else.&quot; Alongside this unusual premise, he noted: &quot;there are probably quite a few people who secretly want to see That Bitch Tracy Barlow finally get hers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/04/02/without-a-trace/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081136/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2007/04/02/without-a-trace/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2011|title=Without a Trace|last=Perkins|first=Steven|date=2 April 2007|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Radio Times]]'' included Tracy in their feature profiling '[[bunny boiler]]s' of soap opera.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Gareth|title=Soapland's top bunny-boilers|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/810-soaps-bunny-boilers/|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=([[BBC Magazines]])|accessdate=2011-01-01|date=29 November 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vOscOXuK?url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/810-soaps-bunny-boilers/|archivedate=1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing her they stated: &quot;Qualifying as much as a soap villain as a bunny-boiler, grown-up Tracy in her final incarnation displayed enough deranged behaviour to have Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail bounding for the hills.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bunny&quot;/&gt; Opining on her temper they added: &quot;Tracy was capable of a rage so hot that, by comparison, the fires of hell were chilly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bunny&quot;/&gt; They also offered their opinion on what could have made her this way, blaming Ken's and Deirdre's behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;bunny&quot;/&gt; The character has been dubbed by the media and viewers as, &quot;Toxic Tracy&quot;.

A reporter writing for the ''[[Inside Soap|Inside Soap Yearbook 2017]]'' named Tracy and Carla's feud as one of the &quot;best bits of February&quot;, describing the pair as &quot;sworn enemies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;February&quot;/&gt; They described Tracy confronting Carla as &quot;the big moment&quot; in the episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;February&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=The best bits of February: EastEnders - The claws are out!|journal=[[Inside Soap]] Yearbook 2017|page=12|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willard &quot;Digger&quot; Barnes''' is a [[fictional character]] in the popular American television series, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', played by [[David Wayne]] (1978), [[Keenan Wynn]] (1979-1980), and [[David Marshall Grant]] in ''[[Dallas: The Early Years]]''. As the patriarch of the [[Barnes family]], Digger Barnes was the father of [[Cliff Barnes]] and [[Pam Ewing|Pamela Barnes Ewing]]. Digger shocked Pamela on his deathbed by revealing that Hutch McKinney was her biological father but, that he had always loved her as though she were his own.

==Character's biography==
Willard Barnes' father, Henry Barnes, was best friends with Aaron Southworth, the father of [[Miss Ellie Ewing|Ellie Southworth]]. In fact, Henry saved Aaron's life so Aaron took care of young Willard throughout much of his adolescence. Willard first started dating Ellie in 1930, when Ellie was 15. However, after being caught with Ellie by her brother, Garrison, Willard decided to try his fortune at wildcatting. As a result, he met [[Jock Ewing]] while riding in a train [[boxcar]] on the way to the oil fields, and the two became friends. Willard, Jock and Jock's brother Jason all became [[wildcatter]]s and began drilling their own fields. Willard had a unique ability to smell oil underground, earning him the nickname &quot;Digger&quot;, which over time became the name that people used more and more (even his children would sometimes call him &quot;Digger&quot;, in addition to &quot;Daddy&quot;), eventually getting to the point where virtually nobody called him &quot;Willard&quot; anymore.

Digger's brilliant ability to sniff oil, combined with Jock's brilliant business skills, enabled them to start making a fortune. Digger and Jason had a lot of disagreements and didn't get on, but Jock would always stand up for Digger at this time. Jason soon left Texas to wildcat in Alaska, where he married a woman named Nancy Shaw, and fathered two children, a son named Jack and a daughter named Jamie. Digger and Jock returned to Dallas where they started, and they soon became rivals over Digger's girlfriend, [[Miss Ellie Ewing|Ellie Southworth]]. Digger's love for Miss Ellie had only grown since their initial brief romance in 1930, but Digger's drinking, gambling and undependability eventually made Miss Ellie see that Digger would never change and that he was not the type of man to marry. Jock and Ellie became a couple in the fall of 1935, and Jock married a pregnant Miss Ellie in 1936, putting the first serious dent in Digger's and Jock's friendship.

Digger wandered across the country for years after he lost Ellie to Jock, although he still did business deals with Jock regarding their oil ventures for a few more years. Even as late as 1939, Jock and Digger both signed a deal to share the profits of Ewing 23 between themselves and their heirs in perpetuity. However, when Ewing 6 came in, Jock put the field in his name only, to prevent Digger from gambling and drinking his half away. Digger was furious and he claimed that Jock had stolen the wells for himself, ending their friendship and business relationship. While Digger was known for his liking of alcohol even when he was still on good terms with Jock, it was in the years following his fallout with Jock that Digger's wandering and drinking worsened considerably, causing the alcoholic troubles that would end his life many decades later, although he would have some periods of sobriety in between.

Sometime after [[World War II]] finished, Digger married a then teenage woman named [[Rebecca Barnes Wentworth|Rebecca Blake]], who became the mother of their children, Tyler, [[Cliff Barnes|Cliff]], Catherine and [[Pam Ewing|Pamela]]. Tyler and Catherine both died in infancy. It was a mostly volatile marriage, due to Digger's bitterness at the Ewings, his heavy drinking and the pain caused by the deaths of Tyler and Catherine. Rebecca left Digger, Cliff and Pam, when Pam was just a year old. Digger became a single father who raised Cliff and Pam with the help of his sister, Maggie.

In 1951, Jock tries to make peace with Digger by giving him a piece of Southfork, but Digger bitterly refuses and instead has Jock buy the land from him. Later, Digger is then ordered by his boss to deliver some oil samples to a customer. On his way there, he then spots a rabbit. Digger then tries to kill the rabbit but misses it. When trying to find the rabbit he notices the land that was supposed to be given to him by his father. Digger then immediately has flashbacks about Ellie telling him that when his father died Digger would have the land. Digger then notices a pile of mud. He suddenly realizes that there is oil underground. A self-disappointed Digger then throws a temper tantrum in the mud because he realizes that by selling his land back to Southworth he also sold the oil that he found. Due to this mistake he wouldn't be able to dig and sell that piece of oil. After that, he seems to laugh if off as if he was just having fun when really he was probably happy to at least have found that piece of oil. Not long after that, Digger then heads off the Ewing barbecue. There an angry Digger fires a shot at Jock but fails miserably. 
Elie tries to calm Digger down while a young JR mocks him, calling him a drunk and a coward. Digger then drops the gun and faints. Jock then orders his men to put him in the house.

In 1979, after a dizzy spell, Cliff took Digger to the doctor, and Digger was diagnosed with [[neurofibromatosis]], an inherited genetic condition that is passed down from parent to child, and is a potentially deadly risk, to young babies in particular. The neurofibromatosis was very likely responsible for the premature deaths of Digger's children, Tyler and Catherine, both of whom died before they reached their first birthday. At the time of the diagnosis, there was a strong possibility that Cliff was the biological father of baby [[John Ross Ewing III]], who was the son of [[J.R. Ewing]]'s wife, [[Sue Ellen Ewing]], and there were fears for the health of John Ross from Cliff, who wanted to talk to Sue Ellen. At Pam's urging, they decided not to say anything, to discreetly take John Ross for tests, and to keep a close eye on the situation. Despite the probability odds, tests later confirmed that J.R. was the biological father of baby John Ross, rather than Cliff.

It was also later revealed that Digger was not Pam's biological father as a man named Hutch McKinney had been having an affair with Rebecca. Digger revealed that he discovered his pregnant wife together with Hutch McKinney on the night after Hutch had been fired from Southfork Ranch by Jock Ewing in December 1952, after Digger had been out drinking. A confrontation followed where Rebecca stated that she and Cliff were leaving Digger to move away with Hutch, and that Hutch was the father of her unborn baby. An angry Digger punched Hutch and Hutch pulled a gun on Digger, the gun being Jock Ewing's, which Hutch had stolen that night before he left Southfork. This then resulted in Rebecca taking Hutch by surprise, disarming him, and Digger picking up the gun and shooting Hutch dead in a temper. Digger then buried Hutch's body on Southfork land, where it remained undiscovered for over 25 years. Rebecca gave birth to Hutch's biological daughter, Pamela, and both she and Digger passed the child off as Digger's own daughter, with Digger becoming Pam's legal father. Early in Pam's life, Rebecca left Digger, leaving Cliff and Pam behind. Pam and Cliff were both raised by Digger and Digger's sister, Maggie. When Rebecca left her husband and kids behind, she left in such a way that Digger believed that she was dead.

When Jock Ewing was indicted for murdering Hutch McKinney, Digger revealed on his deathbed that due to his longstanding love for Miss Ellie, and not wanting to devastate her life, as would be the case if Jock were sent to prison, he confessed to murdering Hutch. Digger died of alcohol poisoning in 1980, after decades of mostly heavy drinking. Jock claimed that he never cheated Digger out of a fortune but had taken control of the company, because Digger would have squandered any profit. The feud between the Ewing and Barnes families never ended, and continued through the years with Jock's son, [[J.R. Ewing|J.R.]], and Digger's son, [[Cliff Barnes|Cliff]].

==Dallas (2012 TV series)==
In [[Ewings Unite!]], his name was seen written on the will of his wife. Cliff would mention his name in [[Love &amp; Family]], saying he would finally gain control of what had been stolen from Digger Barnes.

Despite obtaining Ewing Oil at the end of the original series, Cliff didn't let the feud drop and in 2013 his prime goal was taking down the Ewings and getting hold of their new company Ewing Energies, still feeling that Digger and the Barnes were cheated. This feud ended when Cliff was implicated in the murder of J.R. Ewing and sent to a Mexican prison. Although his daughter Pamela (Digger's granddaughter) discovered Cliff was innocent of J.R.'s murder, she left him in prison for indirectly killing her unborn children on a rig explosion, but gave Cliff the deeds to Digger's deserved land, only at the expense of not being able to enjoy it. Overall though, Pamela decided to continue on the Barnes-Ewing feud, being the third generation.

'''Baron Victor von Frankenstein''' is the [[Hammer Horror]] version of the fictional character [[Victor Frankenstein]] from [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]''

== Character ==

Unlike his novel counterpart - a well-intentioned Viennese medical student - Frankenstein in the Hammer universe is a ruthless, coldhearted baron who lives in Karlstaad, Switzerland. He brutally murders people to get body parts for [[Frankenstein's monster|his creation]]. Once he creates the monster, Frankenstein uses him to kill people who get in his way. Throughout the film series, Frankenstein uses the monster to commit greater and more sinister crimes.

== In film ==
Baron von Frankenstin makes his film debut in Hammer's 1958 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel, entitled ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]''. He is portrayed by Hammer star [[Peter Cushing]], who would go on to play the character in many sequels.  

In the film, Frankenstein murders a professor in order to create his monster. Frankenstein cheats on his fiancée, Elizabeth, with his maid, Justine. When Justine announces that she is pregnant and threatens to tell Elizabeth about their affair, Frankenstein has the monster kill her. Frankenstein soon reluctantly destroys the monster and is sentenced to the gallows. 

In the film's sequel, ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' the Baron escapes the gallows with the help of a maniacal dwarf, and plans to create a new creature. As part of their deal, the dwarf has his brain implanted in the new creature, not realising that side-effects of the transplant are homicidal mania and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] urges. This is when Frankenstein becomes slightly more anti-heroic rather than villainous when he tries to stop his evil creation. In the film he uses the alias, &quot;Dr Victor Stein&quot;.

In ''[[Frankenstein Created Woman]]'' Frankenstein is viewed as less of an outright villain but more of a secondary, yet titular character, concerned with transplanting ''souls''. He does try to stop the havoc he has caused, though he is too late.

In ''[[Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed]]'', the Baron appears as elderly man. Finally resorting to murder to make a new monster, his ''creation'' ([[Freddie Jones]]), turns on him and apparently destroys the villainous baron once and for all. 

Hammer did not want to make a further direct sequel as the plots were becoming too similar, but as the character was still perceived to be popular and viable they remade the first film as a black comedy entitled ''[[The Horror of Frankenstein]]''. This is the only Hammer film to feature an adult Frankenstein portrayed by a different actor, [[Ralph Bates]], as a younger yet equally devious villain with humorous attributes ([[Melvyn Hayes]] played the youthful Frankenstein in the original film).

It was then that Hammer decided to end the franchise with one more film, ''[[Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell]]''. In the film Frankenstein is working and living in a mental asylum, but uses various schemes to get contraband and privileges from the asylum's corrupt manager. Frankenstein begins murdering patients to build another monster, which is obviously insane. The film ends with Frankenstein vowing to continue his experiments with the dead. This film is notable for being set in an earlier era than the previous Peter Cushing Frankenstein film, ''Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed'' and period medical instruments were used for greater accuracy.

'''Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Barrett''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Tai Hara]]. The character made his first screen appearance on 28 August 2013. Hara relocated to [[Sydney]] to take on the role. [[Kyle Pryor]] who plays fellow character [[Nate Cooper]] originally auditioned for the role. Andy and his half-brother [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh]] (Jackson Gallagher) were introduced to viewers through a series of online [[webisodes]] titled ''Home and Away Extras'', prior to appearing in the main series. Andy is characterised as a troubled man because of his upbringing and disappearance of his father. Hara has described his character as &quot;extremely unpredictable&quot; and very protective of his brother. Andy has spent time in prison and causes trouble from his first episode. Andy's initial storyline was a feud with the Braxton family which had been ongoing before he was born. Through this story, writers involved Andy in crimes ranging from fights and car chases to explosions and shootings. Hara announced he would be departing from the show on 22 February 2016, after over three years in the role and Andy made his final appearance on 5 July 2016.

Producers created a romantic partnership between Andy and [[Hannah Wilson (Home and Away)|Hannah Wilson]] (Cassie Howarth). Their on/off relationship has been focused on heavily during his tenure. Andy is also involved in drug dealing which saw him temporarily separated from Hannah. His involvement leads to the death of [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]), which prompts Andy to want to change his life. He sets on cause to become a gym instructor, become literate and maintain a relationship with Hannah. The latter rarely goes well as they face problems such as Hannah's Paralysis, her infidelity and Andy's temper. The character became popular with viewers as the Barrett brothers gained a fan-base. A reporter from the ''The Daily Examiner'' said that Andy continually causes friction on the show. A writer from ''TV Soap'' noted that trouble follows Andy everywhere. They concluded that writers transformed the character from &quot;rough customer&quot; to &quot;respectable citizen&quot;.

==Casting==
The character and Hara's casting was reported by Debbie Schipp from ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' on 3 August 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barretts&quot;/&gt; Hara relocated from [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] to [[Sydney]] to take on the role.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vrajlal|first1=Alicia|title=Home and Away's Tai Hara supports his Hi-5 star girlfriend Fely Irvine as she auditions for The Voice|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2616488/Home-Aways-Tai-Hara-supports-Hi-5-star-girlfriend-Fely-Irvine-auditions-The-Voice.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of being cast in ''Home and Away'', Hara commented &quot;I thought how lucky I was. It's just a real privilege to be on a show that is so loved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barretts&quot;/&gt; Andy was introduced to the show along with his brother [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh]] (Jackson Gallagher). The characters first appeared in online [[webisodes]], which explored their backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barretts&quot;/&gt; The Barretts were initially rivals of the Braxton brothers and Hara said &quot;There is a lot of history behind both the families. I carry the secrets of what our whole relationship is with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barretts&quot;/&gt; Andy's debut on the main show was broadcast on 28 August 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barretts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/home-and-away-introduces-new-bad-boys-tai-hara-and-jackson-gallagher-with-innovative-webisodes/story-fni0cvc9-1226690688394|title=Home and Away introduces new bad boys Tai Hara and Jackson Gallagher with innovative webisodes|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|date=3 August 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British actor [[Kyle Pryor]] also auditioned for the role with an Australian accent. But producers thought he was better suited to the role of [[Nate Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gavin|last1=Scott|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Paging doctor sexy|date=21–27 September 2013|issue=38|pages=32, 33|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
{{quote|Andy's father was his world during his formative years in Mangrove River. So Johnny Barrett’s disappearance was a devastating blow. In the aftermath, the Barrett family fell to pieces. Thirteen-year-old Andy tried to step up but he struggled to cope. Andy continued to carry the stress with him to school and began lashing out. He soon landed in juvie.|source=An excerpt taken from the official ''Home and Away'' website outlining Andy's backstory.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Andy Barrett|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/characters/andy-barrett/|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andy is characterised as an over-protective brother to Josh. He has an uncontrollable temper which leads gets him into trouble. His anger issues date back to the disappearance of his father which changed him and eventually led to him being reprimanded by the law.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He is a &quot;feisty&quot; resident of the infamous Mangrove River who &quot;thinks with his fists before thinking of consequences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Hara (plays Andy Barrett)|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/clips/18572222/tai-hara-plays-andy-barrett-/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a &quot;loose cannon&quot; and harbours a &quot;volatile mood&quot; which has gained him a significant criminal history. They added that his attitude would only carry on adding to his criminality.&lt;ref name=arrive&gt;{{cite web|title=The Barrett Brothers arrive in Summer Bay|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/18593815/the-barrett-brothers-arrive-in-summer-bay/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hara told a [[Yahoo!7]] reporter that &quot;he's an extremely unpredictable and protective character and regardless of his circumstances, family always comes first.&quot; Andy was forced to take care of Josh in the absence of their father. Hara added that &quot;although sometimes he lacks morals and normal social behaviour, everything he does for his brother, despite how reckless, it comes from a place of love.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Hara|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/tai-hara/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Home and Away Extras''===
Andy and Josh were introduced to viewers in a series of four special online episodes titled ''Home and Away Extras'', which were made available online from 7 August.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; The episodes gave fans a chance to see the characters prior to their on-screen arrival. They were written by Supervising Script Producer, Louise Bowes and directed by Danny Raco.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt;

A promotional article stated that the footage would reveal a shared history and angst with the established characters of [[Darryl Braxton|Brax]] ([[Steve Peacocke]]), [[Heath Braxton|Heath]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) and [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]).&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; To coincide with the content the show produced a series of additional content such as spoilers and cast interviews as extra promotion. Series Producer Lucy Addario created the &quot;webisodes&quot; because she wanted alternative ways for viewers to interact with the ''Home and Away'' brand.&lt;ref name=webisode/&gt; She added &quot;we're going to reveal dramatic details of the characters' back-stories before they are introduced as a major storyline.&quot; ''Home and Away Extras'' completed its run on 26 August and Andy was introduced into the main show two days later.&lt;ref name=webisode&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away introduces new characters in web exclusive videos|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/18362277/home-and-away-introduces-new-characters-in-web-exclusive-videos/#page1|website=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network 7]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feud with the Braxton family===
To introduce Andy and Josh into the main series ''Home and Away'' developed a feud storyline between the Barrett and the Braxton brothers. The established Braxton family were popular with viewers and garnered a large fan base. Hara was not worried about their popularity ruining the chances of his character being successful and believed the Barretts would gain their own fans. He warned that Andy does not get intimidated by no one and would comfortably rival the Braxton brothers.&lt;ref name=rival/&gt; Ewing told a ''TV Week'' reporter that the Braxtons would still be the &quot;top dog&quot; but the Barretts would give them &quot;a run for their money&quot;. He believed his family had the advantage because they learned to carefully think about their actions whereas Andy is an &quot;act first, think later&quot; type of character.&lt;ref name=rival&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Unleash the beast|date=31 August – 6 September 2013|issue=35|pages=12, 13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline began when Josh meets [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]) at a party and she refuses to leave. Her friend Casey does not approve of Maddy trying to lose her virginity and starts an argument with Josh. Younes explained that Andy gets involved and they fight, but he manages to defuse the trouble. He added &quot;Casey has no idea who these guys are. He's never met them, but they say that they have.&quot;&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; When Casey and Maddy drive away Andy decides to start a car chase and runs Casey's car off the road causing an accident and explosion. He is left with life changing injuries. The crash and subsequent explosion were big stunt scenes for the show. The car chase scenes Andy featured in were filmed at night on location down a narrow road, the cast described the shoot as a &quot;scary&quot; scenario.&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Heroes of the Bay|date=24–30 August 2013|issue=34|pages=10, 11|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Casey's brother Brax learns that Andy and Josh caused the accident he attacks Josh. [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) intervenes but Brax hits Andy instead. Hara stated that &quot;hot head&quot; Andy is not afraid of a fight or Brax because of his upbringing. Andy and Brax have known each other for a long time and there was &quot;bad blood&quot; between them. He added that &quot;revenge is something they've all grown up with. You strike someone and they strike back. I think Andy will be prepared whatever happens.&quot;&lt;ref name=rival/&gt; Gallagher added that there is a &quot;lot of unspoken history&quot; between Andy and Brax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=You'll see me in my boardies a bit|date=31 August – 6 September 2013|issue=35|pages=52|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers then decided to cause a divide between the Barrett brothers and added a new dynamic between Brax and Josh. Realising that Josh is homeless, Brax asks Josh to stay at his home. Gallagher explained that it was Andy's hatred that influenced Josh's feelings towards the Braxtons. His attitude does not change but he begins to see another side to Brax. The actor added, &quot;deep down he doesn't hold the same anger and resentment Andy does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gavin|last1=Scott|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax's truce|date=21–27 September 2013|issue=38|pages=15|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the effect the Barrett's arrival has on Brax becomes apparent and he visits [[Debbie Barrett]] (Olivia Pigeot) to confess that he killed Andy's step-father [[Johnny Barrett (Home and Away)|Johnny Barrett]] (Stephen Anderton). Andy attacks Brax in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax behind bars|date=28 September – 4 October 2013|issue=39|pages=10, 11|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brax appears in court Andy considers shooting Brax. But Debbie steals the gun and tries to shoot Brax, but Josh is hit by the bullet but survives. The cast were not allowed to reveal who fired the shot before the episode aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Brax under fire|date=5–11 October 2013|issue=40|pages=12|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this Andy becomes jealous that Josh is spending all his time with Maddy and spikes her drink. A reporter from ''TV Week'' wrote that following Maddy behaving erratically Josh punches his brother for his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Glen|last1=Williams|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Elsewhere in the Bay|date=16–22 November 2013|issue=46|pages=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later development it is revealed that Johnny had slept with [[Cheryl Braxton]] (Suzi Dougherty) and had fathered Casey.&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; Andy was angry with this and Hara told Shayn from [[The Edge (New Zealand)|The Edge]] that &quot;he is never going to be considered a Barrett in Andy's eyes&quot; and &quot;Brax is not happy to learn his mother slept with their dad&quot;. He also explained that the Barrett and Braxton feud had been going on long before Andy was born.&lt;ref name=radioint&gt;{{cite web|first1=Sharyn|last1=Clint|title=Home and Away's Andy Barrett|url=http://www.theedge.co.nz/Home-and-Aways-Andy-Barrett/tabid/155/articleID/31362/Default.aspx|website=[[The Edge (New Zealand)|The Edge]]|publisher=([[MediaWorks New Zealand]])|accessdate=19 June 2015|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug dealing===
The show decided to begin Andy's journey through 2014 by exploring his &quot;dark past&quot;. A guest character, [[List of Home and Away characters (2014)#Sean Green|Sean Green]] ([[Khan Chittenden]]) was introduced on-screen as Andy's old prison enemy.&lt;ref name=gym/&gt; He targets Andy's livelihood by vandalising the gym he works at. Hara told Miller that it comes at a point in Andy's life when things were &quot;looking up for him&quot;. It becomes apparent that Sean wants revenge because Andy made a deal to leave jail at Sean's expense by naming him for a crime. He threatens to hurt Josh and Maddy if he does not tell the truth.&lt;ref name=gym/&gt; Hara added that &quot;Andy feels responsible for putting them at risk, he doesn't want Josh involved in this.&quot; Andy tries to reason with Sean but he gathers a gang to punish the character.&lt;ref name=gym&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|date=1–7 February 2014|title=Blast from the past!|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|issue=5|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline marked a turning point of the Braxton/Barrett feud as Casey gathers his family to help Andy and [[Kyle Braxton]] ([[Nic Westaway]]) rescues him by attacking Sean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Violent siege|journal=Soap World|date=March 2014|pages=10|publisher=[[nextmedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show created a drug dealing storyline for Andy, which saw him trying to raise money to move out of the Summer Bay caravan park. He begins selling marijuana but his girlfriend [[Hannah Wilson (Home and Away)|Hannah Wilson]] (Cassie Howarth) destroys the drugs when she finds them in her home. This gets Andy into debt with the drug gang.&lt;ref name=deal/&gt; In retaliation Josh is seriously assaulted by the gang. Hara told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that Andy knows that the attack on Josh is a warning.&lt;ref name=beat/&gt; He added that &quot;he's incredibly protective of his little brother, so of course he feels responsible for what's happened.&quot; Despite Josh becoming involved in his predicament he cannot afford to pay his debt. Hara explained that his character is &quot;dead broke&quot; and &quot;in some deep debt&quot;.&lt;ref name=beat&gt;{{cite journal|title=Josh is beaten up!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 September 2014|issue=36|pages=31|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline developed chaotically as Andy's debt continued to grow. He believes he can prolong paying his suppliers off by meeting up with them and pleading for more time. Hara said that it does not go according to plan and Andy is left with severe injuries following an assault and being thrown from a moving vehicle.&lt;ref name=car/&gt; The story sees Andy turning to Casey for help, Hara explained Andy's out-of-character actions were because the dealers are &quot;unpredictable so everyone close to Andy is at risk.&quot; The storyline made way for a different dynamic between Andy and &quot;arch-nemisis&quot; Brax as he is forced to accept money from him to clear his debts. But Hara warned that his character would become more erratic, adding &quot;Andy's heading down a path of self-destruction - and someone will pay for his mistakes.&quot;&lt;ref name=car&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andy's big mistake|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 October 2014|issue=39|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brynmor Pattison from the ''[[Irish Mirror]]'' observed the storyline as a &quot;dramatic development that pulls many other characters into a vortex of trouble.&quot; While Hara explained that the drug dealing &quot;will cause a domino effect that implicates numerous people and puts their lives at risk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pattison|first1=Brynmor|title=Home And Away spoilers: Every cast members' 'lives at risk' with trouble brewing in Summer Bay|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/whats-on-news/home-away-spoilers-every-cast-4036604|website=[[Irish Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=28 March 2015|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casey's death===
The main dealer is revealed to be [[Jake Pirovic]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]), unbeknownst to him the sworn enemy of the Braxton family. He uses Andy in his plan to enact revenge on Brax for killing his brother, [[Hammer Pirovic|Hammer]] ([[Benedict Samuel]]) . But when Andy tries to defy him, Josh is kidnapped and Andy if forced to beg Casey for help.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; Gallagher explained that Stephen Downie (''TV Week'') that Andy does not realise the severity of his involvement with Jake. He added that the storyline was &quot;very heavy&quot; viewing.&lt;ref name=table&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Kidnapped again|date=6–12 September 2014|issue=36|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hara said that Andy no longer wants anything to do with Jake because &quot;he's exploited and manipulated him into a situation that seems irreversible.&quot;&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; The interviewers questioned why Casey would want to help Andy after his constant trouble making. Younes explained that his character &quot;sees the best in Andy&quot; and wants him to change his life for the better.&lt;ref name=uses/&gt; When Casey realises that Jake is involved he tries to keep Brax out of the situation. But he fails and Andy, Brax, Casey and Kyle end up in a fatal confrontation with Jake. ''Home and Away's'' producers put an embargo on which character would be killed off in the scenes. They kept viewers guessing by confirming one character at the scene would definitely die. Following a shooting, Casey dies in Brax's arms.&lt;ref name=uses&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Murder!|date=13–19 September 2014|issue=37|pages=12, 13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara told Chantay Logan of the ''[[Gold Coast Bulletin]]'' that many fans were &quot;devastated&quot; following the death of Casey. But he noted that &quot;a lot of them were sticking up for me too, there’s not that much hate there. It’ll be interesting to see if the audience goes along on the rest of Andy’s journey with him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Chantay|title=Former Gold Coaster Tai Hara has his work cut out for him with Dancing with the Stars and Home &amp; Away gigs|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/entertainment/former-gold-coaster-tai-hara-has-his-work-cut-out-for-him-with-dancing-with-the-stars-and-home-away-gigs/story-fnj94hgr-1227079061877|website=[[Gold Coast Bulletin]]|publisher=([[News Corp Australia]])|accessdate=27 March 2015|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Hill from the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported that Andy and Brax would team up to avenge Casey's death. But a high speed car chase results in a crash. Hara stated that &quot;Andy and Brax need to end this before more people get killed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Susan|title=Home and Away: Darryl Braxton plots revenge as he reaches a collision course with Jake|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/402192/Home-and-Away-Darryl-Braxton-plots-revenge-as-he-reaches-a-collision-course-with-Jake|website=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=28 March 2015|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Jake dead, Andy is left to face the wrath of other characters. But Brax is forgiving of his one-time-nemesis. Hara explained that &quot;Brax doesn't blame Andy for what happened to Casey. He understands that Andy was manipulated by Jake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Playing with fire|date=27 September – 3 October 2014|issue=39|pages=16, 17|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Hannah Wilson===
[[File:Cassie Howarth.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cassie Howarth (''pictured'') plays Andy's love interest Hannah Wilson.]]
The show decided to renew the partnership between Andy and Hannah. She asks Andy to meet with her, feeling confused Andy asks [[Denny Miller]] (Jessica Grace Smith) how Hannah feels. But Denny still blames Andy for Casey's death and lies to him. Andy sleeps with [[Neive Devlin]] ([[Jolene Anderson]]) in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Downie|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Love hotel|date=22–28 November 2014|issue=47|pages=15|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannah is involved in a bus crash and is told she may never walk again. One aspect of the storyline showed Andy afraid to have sex with Hannah in case he hurt her due to her disability. Howarth was unhappy when she received the scripts because she believed that there were other topics that their storyline could have explored. But writers told Howarth that it is a &quot;very real situation&quot; and one they felt ''Home and Away'' needed to portray.&lt;ref name=writers/&gt; Hannah presumes that she has become a burden on Andy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are the Palmers leaving?|url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/news/articles/2015/3/are-the-palmers-leaving/|website=[[TV Week]]|publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]])|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wants to have sex and Andy's reluctance leaves Hannah feeling dejected. Howarth told an ''Inside Soap'' writer that Andy &quot;freaks out&quot; when Hannah tries to be intimate. They do not have the same physical relationship they once shared so he finds it &quot;strange&quot;.&lt;ref name=dumps/&gt; [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]) advises Andy that there is no medical reason not resume sexual activity, but Hannah ends their relationship before he can apologise. Howarth added that &quot;Andy has become more like a carer to Hannah than a boyfriend, and she doesn't want that for either of them. She wants Andy to have the opportunity to be happy with someone else. She wishes for him to enjoy a normal life.&quot; Despite this their love for one another remains and the actress added that Andy chooses not to give up on their relationship.&lt;ref name=dumps&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hannah dumps Andy!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=28 March – 3 April 2015|issue=12|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy knows that he still loves Hannah and tries to resume their relationship, asking Denny for help. Hara told Erin Miller (''TV Week'') that &quot;Andy told Hannah he's not the same person he used to be. It's going to be a test for their relationship but he wants to prove that he loves her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Fighting for love|date=14–20 March 2015|issue=11|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair get back together but Hannah soon becomes depressed because she cannot go outside. She decides to behave spontaneously and begs Andy to take her on a boat ride at sea.&lt;ref name=boat/&gt; Howarth explains that being stuck at home has &quot;taken its toll on her both physically and emotionally&quot; and she is &quot;desperate&quot; to go outside. The writers throw the duo into yet another dangerous situation as their boat capsizes. With Hannah's paralysis she is unable to stay afloat and disappears beneath the water. Howarth added that it is dangerous because of her condition. Andy frantically searches for her to save her.&lt;ref name=boat&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erin|last1=Miller|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=All at sea|date=28 March – 3 April 2015|issue=13|pages=13|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem the duo encounter is Andy's literacy problems when he needs help with revision for his personal trainer qualifications.

'''Joshua &quot;Josh&quot; Barrett''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by Jackson Gallagher. The actor was initially hesitant about auditioning for the role, as he believed he was too old to portray a 16-year-old. However, three days after attending the audition, he learnt he was successful. Gallagher relocated to Sydney for filming. His character was introduced along with his on-screen brother [[Andy Barrett]] ([[Tai Hara]]) through a series of online webisodes titled ''Home and Away Extras''. He then made his debut appearance in ''Home and Away'' during the episode broadcast on 27 August 2013. Gallagher's departure from ''Home and Away'' was announced in May 2016, and Josh's last scenes aired on 5 July 2016.

Josh is portrayed as being troubled, but also someone who tries to do the right thing. Gallagher thought Josh was a lovable character deep down and someone who did not want his past to define his future. Several of Josh's storylines has centred around his relationships with [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]) and [[Evelyn MacGuire]] (Philippa Northeast), the latter whom he became engaged to. He has also been involved in Andy's feud with the Braxton family, shot by his mother, held hostage and coward punched by [[Tank Snelgrove]] (Reece Milne), which almost ended his life and left him temporarily blind. In May 2016, Josh was revealed to be [[Charlotte King (Home and Away)|Charlotte King]]'s ([[Erika Heynatz]]) killer, ending months of speculation. After confessing to Charlotte's murder, Josh fled Summer Bay with Andy before he was sent to prison.

==Casting==
On 3 August 2013, Debbie Schipp of ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Jackson Gallagher and [[Tai Hara]] had joined the cast of ''Home and Away'' as brothers Josh and [[Andy Barrett]] respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schipp&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/home-and-away-introduces-new-bad-boys-tai-hara-and-jackson-gallagher-with-innovative-webisodes/story-fni0cvc9-1226690688394?nk=cfb429b18655ca0e93ccfee99540e4e4-1461026598|title=Home and Away introduces new bad boys Tai Hara and Jackson Gallagher with innovative webisodes|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|date=3 August 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schipp also reported that the two characters would appear in stand-alone [[webisodes]] before making their debuts in the main show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schipp&quot;/&gt; When Gallagher heard about the role, he was &quot;hesitant&quot; about auditioning as he thought he was too old to portray a 16-year-old. The actor was in his early 20s and he did not think he had a chance of securing the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;HomeRun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|last2=Richards|first2=Holly|date=30 May – 5 June 2015|title=Hitting a home run|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=22|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the audition on a Friday, he learnt he had been successful on the Monday.&lt;ref name=&quot;HomeRun&quot;/&gt; He commented, &quot;Whatever idea they had in their heads of Josh, I happened to fit that image.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HomeRun&quot;/&gt; The actor relocated to Sydney for filming,&lt;ref name=&quot;Daylesford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hepburnadvocate.com.au/story/1733262/young-daylesford-star-off-to-summer-bay/|title=Young Daylesford star off to Summer Bay|date=28 August 2013|work=Hepburn Advocate|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted to being &quot;terrified&quot; on his first day.&lt;ref name=&quot;HomeRun&quot;/&gt; He spent a total of five months preparing for the part and filming with the show, before making his on-screen debut as Josh on 27 August 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daylesford&quot;/&gt;

===Characterisation===
{{cquote|Josh is a troubled kid with a heart of gold. Life hasn't exactly dealt him the best cards, but he's strong enough to know the difference between what's right and wrong, and he won't let anyone tell him otherwise. Well, that is except for his big brother Andy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/characters/josh-barrett/#page1|title=Josh Barrett|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|4=An excerpt from Josh's profile on the official ''Home and Away'' website.}}
Josh comes from [[Summer Bay]]'s neighbouring suburb [[Mangrove River]], where he was often blamed for things he had not done and received little support from his teachers at school, who thought he was &quot;a waste of space&quot; like his brother Andy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB&quot;/&gt; This caused Josh to ignore their rules and avoid going to school, causing him to be expelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB&quot;/&gt; Gallagher said Josh was &quot;funny&quot;, often tried to do the right thing and had his heart in the right place. He wanted someone to give him a chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/clips/18572226/jackson-gallagher-plays-josh-barrett/#page1|title=Jackson Gallagher plays Josh Barrett|date=10 October 2013|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor thought the audience could relate to Josh's story, especially those that had been misunderstood or judged for where they came from.&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Speaking to a reporter for the ''Hepburn Advocate'', Gallagher felt his character occasionally took over his real identity as he started to think like Josh and often lost himself in the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daylesford&quot;/&gt; He said that he enjoyed portraying the character, saying &quot;what I really like about Josh's story is it demonstrates that your past doesn't necessarily define your future, and you don't have to be who people expect you to be.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daylesford&quot;/&gt;

Gallagher also felt that deep down Josh was &quot;a loveable character&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Double&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=31 August – 6 September 2013|title=Double the trouble|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=35|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher told Lucy Thomas of ''SheRa'' magazine that he felt &quot;funny&quot; about portraying a 17-year-old and trying to reconnect with that period of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheramag.com/jackson-gallagher-gives-gender-inequality-run-money/|title=Jackson Gallagher Gives Gender Inequality a Run for its Money|last=Thomas|first=Lucy|date=16 December 2014|work=SheRa|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also explained that Andy has looked out for Josh and taken care of him in the absence of their father. When Josh started to question whether he wanted to be like Andy, it caused some tension between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Josh felt that he had to do what Andy said, leading to him getting into trouble. The actor also said that the brothers often found themselves getting into fights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Gallagher found it interesting portraying a younger brother, as he is the elder brother in his family in real life.&lt;ref name=&quot;JG&quot;/&gt; Gallagher created &quot;a really great bond&quot; with Hara, and he put it down to them joining the cast at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daylesford&quot;/&gt; They developed a strong brotherly friendship by going on road trips and taking up rock climbing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Double&quot;/&gt;

Josh, his brother Andy and their backstory were introduced to viewers during four stand-alone webisodes titled ''Home and Away Extras'', ahead of their first appearance in the main show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schipp&quot;/&gt; The webisodes were written by Louise Bowes and directed by [[Danny Raco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WebExclusive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/18362277/home-and-away-introduces-new-characters-in-web-exclusive-videos/#page1|title=Home and Away introduces new characters in web exclusive videos|date=5 August 2013|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Home and Away'''s series producer Lucy Addario stated, &quot;We wanted to provide fans with new ways to engage with one of Australia's longest running and most loved television brands. We're going to reveal dramatic details of the characters' back-stories before they are introduced as a major storyline.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WebExclusive&quot;/&gt; The first webisode was released on 7 August 2013, immediately following that day's broadcast of ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schipp&quot;/&gt; An article on the show's official website explained that Barrett brothers come from Mangrove River. They share a history and &quot;bad blood&quot; with the Braxton brothers – [[Darryl Braxton|Brax]] ([[Steve Peacocke]]), [[Heath Braxton|Heath]] ([[Dan Ewing]]) and [[Casey Braxton|Casey]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]) – an established family who arrived in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebExclusive&quot;/&gt;

In the first episode, Josh watches on as Andy throws a glass bottle at the [[Summer Bay]] sign. Andy tells Josh that they have come to the Bay, so he can check up on the Braxton brothers, after he saw their mother in his local pub.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webisodes&quot;/&gt; Andy discovers the Braxtons have left town for Heath's bucks night. Josh recalls that Andy was in juvie with Heath and realises Andy is trying to settle a score with him. Andy tells Josh that the Braxtons were responsible for their father leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webisodes&quot;/&gt; In the third episode, Andy chases after Josh, who storms out of their house following his expulsion from school. Josh tells Andy that stole an exam paper and hid it under their house. Andy offers his help in getting rid of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webisodes&quot;/&gt; Josh meets up with Andy, after he goes to the Braxton's restaurant, and tells him Heath's wedding is back on. He then asks Andy what is going on. Andy explains that their father was friends with [[Danny Braxton]] (Andy McPhee) and took part in an armed robbery that went wrong. He then left the family to avoid the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webisodes&quot;/&gt;

===Introduction===
Josh's introductory storyline to ''Home and Away'' began with him attending Heath's wedding reception on the beach, where he met [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;HorrorCrash&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 October – 1 November 2013|title=Casey &amp; Maddy's horror crash!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=43|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clementi told an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' columnist that Maddy's first impression of Josh was that he was &quot;handsome and mysterious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HorrorCrash&quot;/&gt; After spending the evening talking, Maddy decided that kissing Josh would be the perfect way to make Casey jealous. When Casey noticed Josh and Maddy together, he intervened as he was suspicious of Josh and dragged Maddy away.&lt;ref name=&quot;HorrorCrash&quot;/&gt; As Casey was driving Maddy home, Josh and Andy came up behind them in their vehicle and rammed them, forcing them off the road. Casey and Maddy's car crashed, but Casey managed to get her out before it exploded. He then passed out due to his serious injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;HorrorCrash&quot;/&gt;

Casey was left paralysed following the crash. When his older brother, Brax, learnt from Maddy that Josh and Andy were responsible, he attacked Josh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revenge&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=2–8 November 2013|title=Brax's revenge!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=44|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brax pinned him to the bonnet of his car and was set to punch him when Maddy and [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) intervened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revenge&quot;/&gt; When Brax learned that Josh had been sleeping on the beach, he surprised him by offering him a place to stay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truce&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=21–27 September 2013|title=Brax's truce|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=38|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher told a ''TV Week'' writer that Josh was &quot;unsure about Brax's offer&quot; and did not understand why he wanted to help him out, especially after what he and Andy did to Casey. Gallagher said Josh did not trust Brax, but the offer was tempting as he did not want to stay on the beach anymore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truce&quot;/&gt; The actor also explained that Josh's attitude towards the Braxton brothers had always been influenced Andy. He added, &quot;deep down, he doesn't hold the anger and resentment Andy does. His attitude towards them isn't necessarily changing, but he is seeing another side to them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truce&quot;/&gt;

===Shooting===
After Brax visited Josh and Andy's mother [[Debbie Barrett|Debbie]] (Olivia Pigeot), he began acting strangely, causing his partner [[Ricky Sharpe (Home and Away)|Ricky Sharpe]] ([[Bonnie Sveen]]) to suspect that he might be Josh's father. However, Brax soon confessed to killing Josh's father [[Johnny Barrett (Home and Away)|Johnny Barrett]] (Stephen Anderton) several years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindBars&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|date=28 September – 4 October 2013|title=Brax behind bars!|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=39|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricky begged Brax to keep quiet about Johnny's death, but he told the police and was charged.&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindBars&quot;/&gt; On the day of Brax's trial, Andy planned to take his revenge on his rival by shooting him. He told Josh that he had bought a gun, as he believed prison was too good for Brax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunned&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=7–20 December 2013|title=Josh gunned down!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=49/50|pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to an ''Inside Soap'' reporter, Gallagher said Josh did not think Andy shooting Brax was a good idea because he would end up going to prison himself. Josh had just found out his father was dead, he did not want to lose his brother too.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunned&quot;/&gt; Brax was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and as he was being led out of court, Josh begged Andy to reconsider. But when Andy went to get the gun from his car, he discovered it was missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunned&quot;/&gt;

Josh and Andy soon realised that Debbie had taken the gun, with the intention of shooting Brax herself. Josh went into a panic and Gallagher explained, &quot;in an effort to stop his mum, he puts himself in the firing line. So the bullet meant for Brax hits him in the chest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunned&quot;/&gt; As Debbie realised she had just shot her son, Brax was led away to jail, leaving Andy and Ricky to help Josh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunned&quot;/&gt; While Josh was recovering in hospital, [[Nate Cooper]] ([[Kyle Pryor]]) became concerned that he might develop [[pneumonia]]. Ricky stayed by Josh's side, after telling him that Brax wanted her to watch over him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/spoilers/a541429/spencer-is-reeled-in-by-the-cult/|title=Spencer is reeled in by the cult|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=4 January 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, Johnny's body was located and Josh and Andy returned to the Bay with his ashes and belongings. While they were going through Johnny's wallet they found a photo of a baby that neither of them recognised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sins&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 April – 2 May 2014|title=Sins of the past|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=16|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brax later saw the photo and realised it was Casey. After speaking to his mother, he learnt that Johnny was Casey's biological father, making him and Josh half-brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sins&quot;/&gt;

===Relationship with Evelyn MacGuire===

Weeks later, Josh decided to break up with Maddy, as he did not want to hide his feelings for Evie any longer. Josh confessed to Maddy that he had kissed Evie, leaving her heartbroken and humiliated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dumped&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=20–26 September 2014|title=Maddy gets dumped!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=37|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clementi commented that Maddy knew deep down that something was wrong with their relationship, but she was hoping she was wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dumped&quot;/&gt; As Josh and Evie started openly dating, Maddy used Evie's brother [[Oscar MacGuire|Oscar]] (Jake Speer) to get back at them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dumped&quot;/&gt; Weeks later, Josh and Evie's relationship was tested by his infidelity with Maddy.

===Assault and kidnap===
In 2014, Josh was written into Andy's drug dealing storyline. Josh was set upon and physically assaulted by the drug dealers Andy was working for, after they mistook him for his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Mark James|date=13–26 September 2014|title=Josh attacked!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=331|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh turned to Evie for help and came to the farmhouse, where her aunt [[Hannah Wilson (Home and Away)|Hannah Wilson]] (Cassie Howarth) treated his wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot;/&gt; Evie realised that Andy was the intended target and he begged Hannah not to call the police, claiming that the drugs she found at the house some days prior belonged to her brother-in-law [[Zac MacGuire]] ([[Charlie Clausen]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot;/&gt; Josh saw through Andy's lie and Hannah soon got the truth out of him. Andy insisted that he was trying to support Josh, but she threw him out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot;/&gt; Hara commented that as Andy was &quot;incredibly protective of his little brother&quot;, he felt responsible for what happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beaten&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=13–19 September 2014|title=Josh is beaten up!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=36|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddy was not pleased when she learnt Josh had stayed the night at Evie's. Even after she found out he was attacked, she felt he should have turned to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot;/&gt;

Weeks later, Josh and Evie were kidnapped and held hostage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidnapped&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=11–17 October 2014|title=Josh &amp; Evie kidnapped!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=40|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were along at the Braxtons' house, three drug dealers led by [[Cody Dalton]] (Aaron Glenane) turned up and dragged the couple to the farmhouse, where they were tied up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidnapped&quot;/&gt; Cody then forced Josh to leave Andy a voicemail message for Andy. Gallagher told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter, &quot;Josh is aware that these guys are serious. They've already bashed up him and Andy pretty bad, and Josh really doesn't want Evie to get hurt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidnapped&quot;/&gt; Andy received Josh's message and he and Brax soon showed up. Andy gave Cody the money to pay off his debt, but when Cody tried to extort more money, Brax intimidated him and the other men into leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidnapped&quot;/&gt; Gallagher said Josh was &quot;very relieved&quot; when they left, but he and Evie were left &quot;shaken up&quot; by the ordeal. The actor also said Josh was furious with his brother for putting Evie in danger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidnapped&quot;/&gt;

Andy later joined forces with criminal [[Jake Pirovic]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]), after becoming resentful of the growing bond between Josh and Brax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sights&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=11–25 September 2014|title=In a killers sights|journal=[[nextmedia|TV Soap]]|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy was initially unaware that Jake had previously killed Brax's partner, and what the details of his revenge plan against Brax were.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sights&quot;/&gt; Brax believed Andy when he told him he was trying to stop dealing drugs, as did Josh and Casey. When Brax invited Andy over to his house to help Josh get ready for his formal, Andy was surprised by the warm, family atmosphere and realised that they did not deserve what Jake was planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sights&quot;/&gt; Andy told Jake that he did not want anything bad happening to Brax, but Jake said it was too late and he had Josh kidnapped off the street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sights&quot;/&gt; Andy and Casey managed to find Josh, but Jake escaped. When Brax arrived, Jake fired a gun through the window and the bullet hit Casey, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a606774/home-and-away-shooting-neighbours-rain-arrival/|title=Home and Away shooting, Neighbours Rain arrival|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=1 November 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coward punch===
Josh became central to a storyline focusing on the consequences of a [[coward punch]]. Evie turned to Josh when her new boyfriend [[Tank Snelgrove]] (Reece Milne) held her hostage.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeftForDead&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Gavin|date=17–23 October 2015|title=Josh left for dead|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=42|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a distressed message from her, Josh immediately raced to her location to rescue her. Gallagher said that Josh was worried, as he knew what type of guy Tank was, as he had grown up with people just like him.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeftForDead&quot;/&gt; After Josh brought Evie home, everyone believed the ordeal was over. However, when Oscar spotted Tank outside, Josh went out to confront him. Tank then came up behind Josh and punched him, causing Josh to fall and hit his head on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeftForDead&quot;/&gt; He was not discovered until the following morning. Josh was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and Gallagher explained, &quot;Josh could die. He's in a coma on life support. It appears he's brain-dead – there's a real chance this could be the end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeftForDead&quot;/&gt;

===Murder confession and departure===
During the final episode of 2015, guest character [[Charlotte King (Home and Away)|Charlotte King]] ([[Erika Heynatz]]) was seen meeting a mystery person near the pool, before she was shot and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ding&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Kerry|date=12–25 March 2016|title=Ding-dong! The witch is dead!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|issue=370|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh was named as one of eleven suspects in her death. Kerry Barrett of ''All About Soap'' stated &quot;Yes, we know he's blind. But what if his sight's back just in time for him to take his revenge on Charlotte? Stranger things have happened in Summer Bay...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ding&quot;/&gt; In early May 2016, it was finally revealed that Josh had fatally shot Charlotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/home-and-away/news/a793029/home-and-away-spoilers-who-killed-charlotte-king-the-answer-has-finally-been-revealed/|title=Home and Away spoilers: Who killed Charlotte King? The answer has finally been revealed|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 May 2016|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constable [[Kat Chapman]] ([[Pia Miller]]) worked out Josh was the shooter, after examining some evidence found at the crime scene which belonged to him. She asked him to meet her and he explained that after he had got his sight back that evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt; He was angry that she had killed Evie's half-sister [[Denny Miller (Home and Away)|Denny Miller]] (Jessica Grace Smith) and that she knew Andy had killed [[Jake Pirovic]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt; As he confronted her, Josh reached for his phone and Charlotte pulled a gun on him. He tried to defend himself and in the struggle, he accidentally shot her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt; Josh asked Kat to hold off on arresting him, as Evie had just suffered the loss of her brother and aunt, and she agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt;

On 14 May, Kerry Harvey of [[Stuff.co.nz]] reported that Gallagher would be leaving ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/tv-guide/79895129/home-and-away-stars-death-curse|title=Home And Away star's death curse|last=Harvey|first=Kerry|date=14 May 2016|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh's last scenes were broadcast on 5 July 2016. His exit storyline saw him and his brother Andy flee Summer Bay to avoid going to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTheRun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Stephen|date=2–8 July 2016|title=Brothers on the run|journal=[[TV Week]]|issue=27|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After confessing to killing Charlotte, Josh was charged with her manslaughter. Evie was &quot;devastated&quot; when she learned Josh had killed Charlotte. Ahead of his sentencing, the couple shared &quot;an emotional farewell&quot; at the police station, where they remembered their first kiss. Josh then told Evie that going to prison meant his life was over.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTheRun&quot;/&gt; At the court, Josh was sentenced to a minimum of twenty years. As he was led away from the court, Josh pushed the guard to the ground and he ran to a getaway car driven by Andy. Following his escape, Josh sent Evie a goodbye text message, telling her she would never hear from him again.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTheRun&quot;/&gt;

'''Johnny Basil aka Desmond &quot;Zil&quot; Mobay''', played by [[Lance Reddick]], is a character on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

==Character overview==

An [[African American]] police detective, he is an undercover narcotics officer working under the false identity of '''Desmond Mobay''' and trying to bust the drug trade in Oz. &quot;Mobay&quot; is a Jamaican who wishes to work for the gangsters within Oz. Basil gets too deep undercover, and in the process of attempting to prove his loyalty to the gangsters, he becomes a heroin addict himself and kills an incarcerated police officer.
Later, after being confronted by [[Augustus Hill]], he confesses to the murder. He serves time in the police unit of Oz, Unit J, where he is eventually killed by [[Clayton Hughes]], an incarcerated former correctional officer.

==Season 4 Part I==

Basil arrives prepared to join with the Homeboys, the [[African American]] drug dealers within Emerald City. He gets a job as the Warden's assistant to keep the Warden informed and to have unmonitored access to phones and computers; with these, he regularly emails his partner, Nancy Mears, and his supervisor about what is happening within Oz. Warden [[Leo Glynn]] is, initially, the only person in Oz who knows of Basil's true identity, and he warns him about a similar operation that took place before, resulting in the murder of the undercover cop, [[Paul Markstrom]]. Glynn also warns Basil that he is not allowed to use drugs.  Basil tells Glynn not to worry and that undercover narcs have ways of faking it.  Plus, he added, half of the inmates are already high so they won't know the difference.  Later, it turns out that Basil underestimated the inmates, especially [[Simon Adebisi]], [[Enrique Morales]], and [[Chucky Pancamo]], the big three who don't use drugs.

In a deleted scene, [[Sister Peter Marie]] is the other person who knows about Basil's true identity.  She visits Glynn because she was concerned that Mobay was a drug addict.  Glynn asks Basil to come into the room and tells Sister Pete that he is an undercover cop.  She says that he is very convincing and tells him to be careful.

Inside Em City, he rooms with [[Augustus Hill]], who tells him that if he wants drugs, he should go to [[Kenny Wangler]] and the Homeboys. When Wangler and [[Junior Pierce]] die in a shooting that takes place, Basil asks inmate [[Arnold &quot;Poet&quot; Jackson]] if he can join the Homeboys. Homeboy leader [[Simon Adebisi]] is suspicious of Basil and asks him for the name of a person who can vouch for his criminality. Basil has planned a potential parolee at Lardner named Nester Parks to vouch for him, in exchange for having an easy parole hearing.

His partner Nancy visits him regularly, posing as his girlfriend so they cannot be easily viewed as cops. [[Augustus Hill]] recognizes her, however, from the night of his arrest but does not say anything until later on.  Basil notices this and calls Nancy to tell her not to visit for a while.  He also asks her if she ever encountered a man named Augustus Hill and she says no.

As his first test, the other inmates ask him to snort heroin in front of them, in order to prove that he is one of them. They know he has bought heroin, but they do not know if he has used any (he has not). He takes the heroin and ends up in the hole during a drug shakedown. When released from the hole he is addicted to heroin, but [[Simon Adebisi]] does not yet see him as worthy for being one of them.

His second test involves being able to take a punch from [[Chucky Pancamo]], boxer and the Italian leader. The other inmates gamble on how long Basil would stay standing. He is severely beaten, but stayed standing long enough to gain some of the gangsters' confidence. Poet gives him some heroin as comfort for his wounds, which he uses immediately.

When his partner Nancy visits, she suspects that he is using drugs because his e-mails are incoherent and don't make sense. Instead, she suggests that he be replaced.  However, he convinces her and Warden [[Leo Glynn]] both that he does not use heroin and that he is close to busting Adebisi, Morales, Pancamo, and their allies.

Meanwhile, the gangsters vote in a straw poll over whether or not he is worthy of membership. Pancamo votes yes; Adebisi votes no; and Latino leader [[Enrique Morales]] abstains. To break the tie, his third test is to kill an inmate, making it look like an accident.

Meanwhile, [[Bruno Goergen]], a fellow cop arrives in Oz for killing a weapons dealer. Goergen was a white cop who is bigoted to the Latino, Italian, and Black inmates. He gets beaten up by [[Leroy Tidd]] and [[Mondo Browne]] after saying &quot;[[nigger]]&quot; in front of them. Suspecting that he was beaten up because he was found out to be an ex-cop, he blackmails Basil for protection in exchange for keeping his undercover identity secret. Deciding him to be &quot;Mobay's&quot; imminent murder victim, he lures Goergen to the elevator shaft, using Hill as bait. Basil tells Goergen that Augustus Hill has found out he is a cop and wishes to expose him. As Goergen and Hill struggle beside the open elevator shaft, Basil pretends to help Goergen but then pushes him into the shaft, killing him. This solidifies the trust of the two uncertain gangster leaders, and he is granted membership.

A new unit manager named [[Martin Querns]] comes to Em City, empowering Adebisi, Pancamo, and Morales. He allows them and their followers to do as they wish as long as there is no violence in Em City. Drugs, therefore, flow freely, and Basil, along with Browne and Tidd, are pressured to entice &quot;babies&quot; (new customers) to buy drugs. Basil uses the money he brought to Oz to pretend to find his &quot;babies.&quot; He meanwhile snorts the heroin that he buys, since he has become a full-blown addict.

The gangsters decide that Basil must sell drugs in front of them to prove that he is one of them. Warden Glynn suggests that another undercover detective should pose as a customer, so there are no complications regarding the sale of drugs by a police officer. The cop, Cecil Brand, is seen purchasing drugs from Basil and Poet, and Pancamo assures Adebisi that Basil is indeed worthy of membership.

In the meantime, [[Detective Guinevere McGorry|Detective McGorry]] from homicide is interrogating inmates over who killed Bruno Goergen. &quot;Mobay&quot; agrees to help her if he finds sufficient information. Adebisi finds out the identity of Cecil Brand and commands Basil to kill him. Basil is about to, until [[Augustus Hill]] confronts him about his true identity as an undercover cop. Hill tells Basil that he won't tell anyone, but he calls Basil a fraud because he uses drugs, uses his badge as a weapon and kills people in the name of the law. &quot;Good night Mobay or officer whoever the fuck you are&quot; Hill says.  Angry, Basil grabs Augustus and tells him that if Hill exposes his identity, he is next down the elevator shaft.  He then beats Hill to a bloody pulp.  Shamed, Basil confesses to McGorry and [[Warden Glynn]] that he murdered Goergen because he wanted to prove that he is not a fraud, but real. He is tried for murder and later sent to Unit J for at least three years, the unit for incarcerated police.  As a result of Basil's arrest, the drug investigation is over.

==Season 4 Part II==

In Unit J, Basil no longer under the identity of Mobay rooms with [[Clayton Hughes]] and a sheriff named [[Alvin Yood]]. Yood is a white sheriff from midstate who is imprisoned for assaulting a teenager in an interrogation and is a relatively comedic person to be around. Hughes, on the other hand, is a C.O. turned Black militant who often berates Yood for being White and Basil for taking his side in the arguments.

During mealtime, the Homeboys who work the cafeteria urinate in Basil's food.

Warden [[Leo Glynn]] urges Basil to visit his wife, lieutenant, and former partner Nancy. He apologizes to his lieutenant, who is sorry to lose him to prison, and to Nancy Mears, who is angered by his presence. Nancy tells him that it's policemen like Basil who make a bad image for cops everywhere, and she is not sorry that he's in prison for doing drugs and committing murder while undercover.

Basil also sees his wife, whom he is scared to see since he let her down. After her visit, Basil insults [[Clayton Hughes]], who in turn murders him. Hughes is sent to solitary as a result. Basil is later seen being placed on the infirmary being zipped in a body bag.

===Murders committed===

* '''[[Bruno Goergen]]''' - Murdered by Basil, pushing him on the bottom of the elevator shaft because he was threatening to put word in Oz that Basil was an undercover cop, and also so Basil gets in good with [[Enrique Morales]], [[Chucky Pancamo]] &amp; [[Simon Adebisi]] if he killed someone in Oz so he continues to bust the drug trade in Oz.

'''Tobias Beecher''' is a main character on the television show ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;^ Sean O'Sullivan and David Wilson, Images of Incarceration: Representations of Prison in Film and Television Drama (Waterside Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; played by [[Lee Tergesen]].  He is one of only nine regular characters to survive the entire run of the show (from first episode to last). The others are [[Bob Rebadow]], [[Ryan O'Reily]], [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]], [[Arnold &quot;Poet&quot; Jackson]], [[Sister Peter Marie Reimondo]], [[Tim McManus]] and [[Dr. Gloria Nathan]].

==Character overview==
''Prisoner 97B412. Convicted July 5, 1997 – Driving while intoxicated, vehicular manslaughter. Sentence: 15 years, up for parole in four. Parole denied in 2001. Granted parole in 2003. Returned to OZ later that year due to a parole violation.''

Beecher, a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]], is a successful attorney, husband and father, but also an [[alcoholic]]. One night, he drives drunk &amp;mdash; something he had already been arrested for twice &amp;mdash; and hits and kills a nine-year-old girl named Kathy Rockwell. He is offered a [[plea bargain]] that would have allowed him to serve his sentence in a minimum security prison, but Beecher, not wanting to do any time in prison, instead goes to trial seeking an [[acquittal]]. The effort fails and the judge, a family friend of the Beechers, decides to make an example of him and sentences him to 15 years in a maximum security prison with a chance for parole after four.

Beecher's personal transformation forms a  major part of the show's drama, particularly in season one. Arriving in Oz without any street skills and having a naturally timid personality, he becomes an easy target for abuse and is hardened by his experiences, particularly with his nemesis, [[Vernon Schillinger]]. He later remarks that, in Oz, he &quot;became the man he always was and never knew&quot;. Despite having done some terrible things while in Oz, including murdering a guard, Beecher often tries to atone, most notably for his part in the death of Schillinger's son.

==Season 1==
Beecher quickly learns that he is out of his element after being roomed with monstrous black inmate [[Simon Adebisi]] during his first week in the titular facility. Approaching him in friendship, fellow inmate [[Vernon Schillinger]] offers to be his new cellmate. Beecher, completely unaware that Schillinger is the leader of [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz]], naively accepts the offer from the seemingly helpful Schillinger, but on their first night in the cell together Beecher is &quot;initiated&quot; into prison life when Schillinger rapes him and burns a [[swastika]] onto his right buttock. Beecher is regularly raped and sexually humiliated by Schillinger as the Brotherhood's sex slave or &quot;prag&quot;. Irish-American inmate [[Ryan O'Reily]] approaches Beecher for legal advice in his appeal, supplying him with [[cannabis]] in exchange. In attempting to deal with the trauma of his regular humiliation, Beecher starts using [[heroin]] and develops an addiction. This is quickly noticed by prison psychologist [[Sister Peter Marie Reimondo]], who arranges for Beecher to attend group drug counseling. 

In preparation for the prison talent show, Schillinger has Beecher get a &quot;makeover&quot; from one of Em City's [[drag queen]]s. At the show, Beecher sings a rendition of &quot;[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)]]&quot; while dressed in women's clothing and wearing women's makeup. Among other tortures, Schillinger makes Beecher beg to have sex with his wife before a [[conjugal visit]], forces him to eat pages of a law book, polish Schillinger's boots with his tongue, and orders him to tear up pictures of his family. In an attempt to reach him, Sister Peter Marie arranges for Beecher to meet with Kathy Rockwell's mother. Beecher is too ashamed to speak, however, and the girl's mother angrily lashes out at him.

Eventually, Schillinger tires of him and forces him to leave the cell wearing a [[Confederate Flag]] t-shirt. Beecher, fearing he will be killed by a black inmate, goes to O'Reily, who provides him with [[Phencyclidine|PCP]].  Beecher then seeks out Schillinger, smashes the acrylic glass wall of Schillinger's cell, and sends a broken shard flying into his eye. Beecher almost jumps to his death immediately afterward, but is restrained by guards and put in solitary confinement as the other inmates in Em City cheer him on. 

After being released, he confronts Schillinger (who now has an eyepatch) in the prison gym's basketball court. He incapacitates Schillinger by kicking him in the groin and assaulting him with a piece of gym equipment, tying him down, then defecates upon him in front of other inmates. This earns him respect from inmates such as O'Reily, [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]], and even Adebisi. When a riot erupts in Em City, Beecher sides with O'Reily in the chaos, defending him from an attack by the [[Muslim]]s, as neither belongs to any strong gangs.

==Season 2==
In the aftermath of the riot, Beecher and the other prisoners housed in Em City are sent to other sections of the prison. Beecher finds himself sharing a cell with [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]], an Aryan member who tries to make Beecher perform oral sex on him. Beecher has by now learned to fight back and bites the tip of Robson's penis off, which ends up in Beecher being sent to solitary. During his time in solitary, he is interviewed by [[Alvah Case]], who is investigating the riot in Emerald City. Beecher reveals that he knows who killed [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]] and cryptically advises to check the bullets in Tim McManus. 

Upon his release from isolation, Beecher begins taunting Schillinger, threatening to manipulate Sister Pete's psychiatric reports to ruin his chances at [[parole]]. Frightened, Schillinger unsuccessfully seeks other inmates to kill Beecher for him. Finally, Schillinger seems to find somebody willing to do the deed: guard [[Diane Whittlesey]], whom he blackmails with knowledge that she had shot a prisoner during the riot. Whittlesey reluctantly agrees to get rid of Beecher if Schillinger will keep quiet. Beecher disappears and Schillinger subsequently meets with Whittlesey to see Beecher's dead body.  At this point Whittlesey reveals that she has been recording their conversation.  Schillinger is arrested for conspiracy to commit murder, lengthening his sentence.

Afterwards, with Schillinger in the hole, Beecher brags to his new cellmate, [[Augustus Hill]], that his plan worked perfectly. Hill warns him that Schillinger, who now has nothing to lose, will be out for revenge even more than he was before. Beecher is too happy to care. During this time, McManus also forces Beecher to confront the judge who sentenced him. She expresses remorse for her ruling and apologizes to Beecher. He responds that she was right in her ruling, but adds that he can't forgive her. Beecher continues to be haunted by dreams of the accident.

Hill is eventually transferred to a different cell. A new inmate, [[Chris Keller]] is brought in, beginning one of the show's most heated and intense rivalries. Keller is a charming [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] doing time for robbing a grocery store and killing the owner. Later, Beecher receives word that his wife has killed herself. Schillinger brags that the Aryan Brotherhood held a gun to her head and forced her to write the suicide letter blaming Beecher for everything that had gone wrong in her life. As time passes, Beecher is surprised to find himself becoming attracted to Keller, and the two eventually share a kiss in the prison laundry room.  Unbeknown to Beecher, however, Keller is working with Schillinger, in order to help the latter get revenge. After using Beecher's attraction to Keller to put him through an emotional wringer and start him drinking again, the two corner him with the help of an Aryan guard, [[Karl Metzger]], and break his arms and legs.

==Season 3==
Keller discovers that he has genuinely fallen in love with Beecher, and is desperate to win Beecher's trust. Beecher, however, rejects Keller and refuses to forgive him unless he confesses to his role in the attack. Beecher then kills Metzger. While Keller does confess, Beecher still withholds forgiveness, and ambushes Keller shortly after his release from the infirmary, stabbing him. Although Keller never sees his attacker, Beecher tells him that he'd been the one who attacked him some time later, and also said he didn't at the same time.

The conflict between Beecher and Schillinger continues throughout the run of the series. When Schillinger's son [[Andy Schillinger|Andy]] is arrested and incarcerated in Oz, Beecher sees his chance to get even with Schillinger by befriending the young man and arranging to share a cell with him. While Beecher never does anything to Andy and in fact helps him cope with his withdrawal from drugs, he leads Schillinger to believe that he is going to bed Andy, since Andy now likes him. Moved by Beecher's kindness, Andy renounces his father and everything he believes in. Schillinger then arranges to have his own son killed, by having him thrown in solitary and asking a prison guard to deliver heroin to him in the hole, knowing he'd break from his sobriety and overdose on the drug. Beecher's co-conspirators in the plan (Keller and Ryan O’Reily) are happy about the outcome, since they have tormented Schillinger and turned his son against him. Beecher isn't as satisfied, despite having gotten revenge, and he feels guilty for his part in Andy's death. At this point, Beecher is cellmates with former Muslim leader [[Kareem Said]], who convinces Beecher to resolve his guilt by asking for forgiveness from Keller and Schillinger. As the racial tension in Oz intensifies, Beecher and Saïd are the only men of different backgrounds who remain friends.

Beecher finally forgives Keller after saving him from Schillinger's attack. In spite of Saïd's disapproval, Keller and Beecher reunite as lovers in the season's finale.

==Season 4==

===Part I===
Beecher tries to resolve his guilt with Schillinger further by having a private investigator at his father's law firm discover his younger son [[Hank Schillinger|Hank]]. Schillinger, however, thinks Beecher was trying to turn Hank against him, and orders Hank to kidnap both of Beecher's children. Hank Schillinger severs Beecher's son's hand and mails it to Beecher in Oz. Hank kills Beecher's son before ultimately releasing his daughter. Schillinger also pays another prisoner to tell Beecher that Keller is responsible for the kidnapping. Enraged, Beecher tries to kill Keller.

When Beecher learns the truth, he tries to apologize to Keller, but Keller casts him aside. Beecher has sex with inmates [[Nate Shemin]] and [[Mondo Browne]], as he needs to &quot;feel something.&quot; Upon learning that Hank Schillinger has been [[acquitted]] due to a [[legal technicality]], he approaches [[Chucky Pancamo]] in order to commission a hit on Hank Schillinger. Beecher has second thoughts shortly afterward, but when he goes to Pancamo to cancel the hit he is informed that it is too late; Hank Schillinger is already dead. Keller later has Shemin and Browne killed in a plot to undermine the authority of Emerald City's new manager, [[Martin Querns]].

===Part II===
When Schillinger learns of Hank's death, he plots revenge — all chance of which is lost after Keller falsely confesses to having hired the hitman. Keller does so to make himself Schillinger's target instead of Beecher, and not long afterwards he is transferred to Massachusetts. Beecher and Schillinger then are involved in a victim-attacker interaction program led by [[Sister Peter Marie]], who is trying to help Beecher fight his inner conflicts. With Keller in Massachusetts for confessing to Hank's murder, Beecher is up for parole and falls in love with his attorney, Katherine McClain. McClain does what she can for Beecher but he is denied parole. Later that day in the library, Schillinger and Robson come by to taunt Beecher, but before they can harm him, Saïd appears and stabs them both.

==Season 5==
Fearing for a war between the Aryans and Muslims, Sister Pete suggests Beecher mediate interaction sessions between himself, Schillinger, and Saïd. In the first interaction session, Beecher says he felt Schillinger's attempts to ruin his parole were semi-justified, and that Saïd and Schillinger are very alike, despite drastic differences in beliefs. As the interaction sessions continue, [[Chucky Pancamo]] informs Beecher that [[Agent Pierce Taylor]] has implicated him in the murder of Hank Schillinger, and has no doubt Agent Taylor will inform Schillinger that Pancamo arranged the hit of his son.  

Shortly after, Keller is transferred back to Oz from Massachusetts. Keller's return to Oz is not easy, however; Taylor now has evidence implicating him in a series of murders, and a guilty verdict will send him to [[death row]]. Keller is isolated from the general population, and thus from Beecher.

In an interaction session when bringing up the subject of homosexuality, Schillinger and Saïd denounce it as a &quot;perversion&quot;. Saïd points out that Schillinger indulges in [[sodomy]], having previously raped Beecher and the mentally handicapped Irish inmate [[Cyril O'Reily]], among others. As Schillinger denies being homosexual and denies raping Beecher or anybody else. Beecher angrily attacks Schillinger for denying raping him. Afterwards, convicted rapists [[Franklin Winthrop]] and [[Adam Guenzel]] arrive in Oz, the latter being a friend of Beecher's family. Winthrop is immediately raped by the Aryans and made into their sex slave; Beecher, fearing for Guenzel's safety, recruits the Italians to protect him. When Robson and several other Aryans attempt to rape Guezel in the gym, the Italians led by [[Frank Urbano]] save him. Angered by a failed attempt, Schillinger forces Winthrop to tell the [[homophobia|homophobic]] Guenzel about Beecher's past sexual relationships with men and falsely claims its well known in Oz that Guenzel is Beecher's new lover.    

Schillinger then apologizes to Beecher in an interaction session and shortly afterwards offers him a deal. Schillinger tells Beecher he can see Keller by working in the mail room if he allows Guenzel to be transferred to Unit B, without the Italians' protection, where Schillinger will be free to do whatever he wishes to Guenzel. Beecher initially refuses, but then considers giving in after growing tired of Guenzel's verbal abuse. When Guenzel is talking with Biker [[Max Sands]], Beecher warns him the Bikers are Schillinger's allies and that is being used to set Guenzel up for Schillinger. Guenzel then [[sucker punch]]es him in front of the entire Em City population and repeatedly pushes Beecher's head toward his groin to simulate oral sex. Beecher gives in to Schillinger's demands and convinces McManus that he can no longer help Guenzel. McManus then transfers Guenzel to Unit B where he is [[gang-rape]]d by the Aryans with Winthrop watching. Beecher later finds Guenzel naked in the gym, beaten, bloody, and raped. 

Stricken with guilt, Beecher asks for Saïd's advice. Saïd counsels Beecher to give up his relationship with Keller and help Guenzel any way he can. Beecher asks Sister Pete to talk to Guenzel and Schillinger; Afraid that Guenzel will eventually inform on the Aryans, Schillinger arranges for Guenzel to &quot;escape&quot;, which results in Guenzel's death courtesy of the [[electric fence]]. Guilty over Guenzel's death, Beecher confesses to the authorities about Schillinger's rapes of Winthrop and Guenzel and his involvement with Guenzel's death. [[Warden Leo Glynn]] moves Schillinger to solitary confinement for an undetermined length of time. Beecher then sees Keller, who has just been found guilty of murder, released from the hospital, where the two of them share an intimate kiss.

==Season 6==
Beecher is transferred to a safer unit, as McManus sees that he has become an Aryan target once again for testifying against Schillinger. Beecher's father, Harrison, in the meantime appeals Keller's death sentence until Winthrop kills him to earn membership in the Aryan Brotherhood. Fortunately, Beecher is paroled, inherits his father's law firm, and gets Keller's death sentence overturned.

Soon afterward, Beecher is sent back to prison after a lonely Keller arranges for him to get caught buying illegal drugs. Keller told Beecher that his ex-wife was terribly ill and asked him to pick up a drug for her that hadn't been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|F.D.A.]] and was thus illegal. After Beecher agrees to do so, Keller anonymously telephones the police and tells them where the deal would take place. Once in prison again, Beecher banishes Keller from his life. In an attempt to make Beecher forgive him, Keller engineers Schillinger's death; during Oz's production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' (in which both Beecher and Schillinger had been cast), he switches a [[Theatrical property|prop]] knife for a real one, resulting in Schillinger's death when Beecher stabs him.

Once Beecher realizes what happened, he and Keller get into a heated argument, during which Keller realizes that Beecher would never be able to love him again.  The argument ends with Beecher rejecting Keller for the final time, as Beecher pushes him away, Keller commits a final act of betrayal by throwing himself backwards over a railing while screaming &quot;Beecher, DON'T!&quot;, effectively committing suicide and implicating Beecher as a murderer. At the end of the series, Beecher is in protective custody to shield him from the Aryans, and awaiting trial for Keller's death. Once the prison is evacuated, Beecher smiles on the bus, knowing Keller was responsible for sending the deadly chemical to the mailroom, as Keller had hinted he would &quot;take care of the Aryans&quot; before his death.

'''Russell &quot;Stringer&quot; Bell''' is a [[fictional character]] in ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', played by [[Idris Elba]]. Bell serves as drug kingpin [[Avon Barksdale]]'s second-in-command, assuming direct control of the [[Barksdale Organization]] during Avon's imprisonment. Bell attends [[economics]] classes at [[Baltimore City Community College]] and maintains a personal library, including a copy of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. He attempts to legitimize the Barksdale Organization and insulate himself from direct criminality through money laundering and investments in housing development, aided through his buying of influence from politicians.

==Biography==

Stringer Bell was born on September 17, 1969. He grew up in the West Baltimore projects with [[Avon Barksdale]] and [[Wee-Bey Brice]], the three being childhood friends.

===Season one===

Stringer is first seen attending the trial of Avon's nephew and lieutenant, [[D'Angelo Barksdale]], for the murder of rival drug dealer &quot;Pooh&quot; Blanchard. Avon has tasked Stringer with ensuring that D'Angelo is [[acquittal|acquitted]]. To this end, Stringer has enforcers Roland &quot;Wee-Bey&quot; Brice, [[Barksdale Organization#Stinkum|Anton &quot;Stinkum&quot; Artis]], and [[Stanfield Organization#Savino Bratton|Savino]] intimidate and bribe witnesses over the course of the trial. When D'Angelo is released, Avon has Stringer demote him to running the operation in the low-rise projects known as &quot;the pit.&quot;

Stringer then has his hands full dealing with [[Omar Little]]'s crew, after they steal some of Barksdale's stash from the pit. Stringer visits D'Angelo to instruct him about checking his organization for an informant who may have been giving Omar information. Avon orders [[contract killing]]s on Omar and all of his crew. Avon also has Stringer assist Stinkum in taking over new territory for the organization.

Stringer takes Stinkum to survey his new territory, with some additional muscle in the form of Wee-Bey and [[Barksdale Organization#Marquis &quot;Bird&quot; Hilton|Marquis &quot;Bird&quot; Hilton]]. While there, Stringer receives word from D'Angelo that two of his crew, [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]] and [[Poot Carr]], have spotted Omar's boyfriend [[Omar Little and associates#Brandon Wright|Brandon Wright]] at an arcade. Stringer drives to meet the young drug dealers at the arcade, bringing the three enforcers. He has them abduct Brandon using handcuffs and posing as police officers. They torture Brandon to death trying to discover Omar's whereabouts. Then, following Avon's orders, they mutilate his corpse and planting the body in the low rises. Omar responds to the brutal slaying by striking back at Stinkum and Wee-Bey as they move into the new territory, killing Stinkum and wounding Wee-Bey.

With this escalation of the conflict, Stringer tries to persuade Avon to offer Omar a truce. His plan is to let Omar grow complacent, then kill him when he lets his guard down. Avon initially brushes this suggestion aside, but after Omar nearly kills him, he accepts Stringer's advice. Stringer also persuades Avon to give up his pager—making Stringer a buffer between Avon and the rest of the operation.

As Avon grows increasingly suspicious that the police are watching him, Stringer takes precautions to smoke out informants and to counter wiretaps. He instructs D'Angelo to withhold pay from his subordinates for several weeks on the grounds that those who don't soon ask for money are likely to be the ones being paid as informants. However, this plan reveals no informants. To foil wiretaps, Stringer insists on phone discipline, telling D'Angelo's crew to remove nearby payphones and walk longer distances to other phones instead.

When it's time for Avon to clean house, Stringer orders the murder of Wallace, who had been a key witness in the killing of Brandon. Stringer tries to find out about Wallace's whereabouts from D'Angelo, but D'Angelo realizes his friend is in danger and only tells Stringer that Wallace left the business. Stringer turns to [[Bodie Broadus]], D'Angelo's second in the pit operation and learns that Wallace has returned to working for D'Angelo. Stringer asks Bodie to murder Wallace. He also has the witness he bribed in D'Angelo's trial, Nakeesha Lyles, killed.

Stringer assumes command of the Barksdale crew when Avon is arrested at the end of season one. D'Angelo is also arrested and when he learns of the murder of his friend Wallace he blames Stringer, driving a wedge between the two. Stringer rewards Bodie's loyalty by promoting him to run their operation at the 221 tower.

===Season two===

In season two, Stringer faces a serious problem when the Barksdales' usual supplier, a [[Dominican people (Dominican Republic)|Dominican]] named Roberto, becomes the focus of a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation. The [[New York City|New York]]-based Dominican syndicate ends its partnership with the Barksdales, suspecting Avon of informing on them in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. Avon finds alternatives through [[Philadelphia]] and [[Atlanta]] connections, but the [[heroin]] they supply is far less potent and more expensive. Compounding this problem, all of Barksdale's main hitmen were arrested or killed in season one. At the same time, [[Proposition Joe]] introduces a purer, more effective heroin line through his connection with [[The Greek]]—leading many drug users to migrate to his territory. With the Barksdales' operation threatened, Stringer grows desperate.

Stringer becomes concerned with D'Angelo's increasingly hostile attitude towards his uncle, fearful that he may turn against the Barksdales. He secretly becomes involved with D'Angelo's ex-girlfriend, [[Barksdale Organization#Donette|Donette]], using the relationship to keep an eye on him. When D'Angelo cuts himself off from the rest of his family, Stringer secretly arranges to [[contract killing|have him killed]] through a connection in [[Washington, DC]]. Stringer's connection has his cousin, who is in the same prison, strangle D'Angelo and stage the death as a suicide. Stringer stresses the need to keep Avon from knowing about his role in D'Angelo's murder.

Looking to solve the Barksdale's struggling drug trade, Stringer decides to go behind Avon's back and secretly agrees to share Barksdale territory with Proposition Joe in exchange for Joe's higher-quality heroin—an idea Avon vehemently opposes. When Avon hires legendary New York enforcer [[Brother Mouzone]] to chase rival drug dealers out of the Barksdale towers, Stringer maneuvers carefully to preserve his alliance with Joe behind Avon's back. He manages to do so by tricking Omar into shooting Mouzone by blaming him for Brandon's death. The plan fails after Omar shoots Mouzone, but calls the paramedics after realizing he's been lied to by Stringer. With Mouzone returning to New York to recover, Avon grudgingly agrees to Proposition Joe's proposal.

===Season three===

Stringer uses more business-like strategies as he continues running the Barksdale empire. He obtains legitimate business fronts for the Barksdale organization, forms the [[New Day Co-Op]] with Proposition Joe and other rival dealers, and runs meetings with his underlings according to [[Robert's Rules of Order]]. Stringer is also shown to have made several donations to consultants and politicians, including the corrupt [[state senator]] [[Clay Davis]], to facilitate development of a [[condominium]] complex.

At the beginning of Season 3, Stringer has reached the apex of his power. Along with Proposition Joe, he effectively runs the drug supply in Baltimore. Joe and Stringer realize that the associated murders, not the drug trade itself, are what bring on serious police investigations, and consequently strive to minimize violence among their crews and the other Co-Op dealers, such as Hungry Man and Fat Face Rick.

The resulting lack of murders forces [[Cedric Daniels]]' Major Crimes Unit to turn its attention elsewhere, namely to a more reckless Jamaican dealer named Kintell Williamson (AKA Prince K). Most of the unit understands the decision, but [[Jimmy McNulty]] angrily objects, pointing out that Stringer is clearly a more prolific trafficker than their new target. This brings McNulty into conflict with [[Lester Freamon]] and Daniels, with [[Kima Greggs]] caught in the middle and [[Roland Pryzbylewski]] and [[Leander Sydnor]] disenchanted with the less interesting Williamson. As a result, Major Crimes, previously the most effective unit in the Criminal Investigative Division, is temporarily compromised and Stringer is able to operate without interference for a time.

When Avon is released from prison, he is uninterested in Stringer's efforts to reform the Barksdale Organization. While Stringer wants to invest the organization's profits in legitimate business investments, Avon is more concerned with an imminent war against rival [[drug lord]] [[Marlo Stanfield]]. As Avon's war against Marlo begins to draw more police attention, Proposition Joe and other Co-Op Members threaten to cut Stringer off from the Greeks' superior heroin supply if he can't convince Avon to stop the violence. In Stringer's view, this would make any victory over Marlo worthless, as street corners generate no money without drugs to sell on them.

When Stringer asserts his opposition to Avon's war against the Stanfield Crew, Avon accuses him of lacking the masculinity necessary for their business—and based on the lack of progress on his condominiums, also accuses him of not being smart enough for the legitimate business world. This causes Stringer to angrily reassert his masculinity by revealing that he had ordered D'Angelo's death. Stringer tells Avon that he chose to have D'Angelo killed because Avon himself would be unable to order the death of his own nephew, even if he knew that D'Angelo would eventually flip.

Stringer's relationship with Avon is irreparably damaged by this revelation. While Avon eventually seems to come to terms with Stringer's confession, it compromises their brotherhood and Avon is no longer willing to protect Stringer from the repercussions of his other manipulations. Ultimately, Stringer's origins in the street have left him without the patience and restraint required to realize his greater ambitions.

Stringer's inroads into [[real estate]] are hamstrung by the nuances of a legitimate business world that he doesn't fully understand, with his condominium project repeatedly delayed by bureaucratic obstacles. Stringer is frustrated by what he perceives as inexcusable foot-dragging that would not be tolerated in the drug world. Worse, Stringer bribes Davis to connect his organization with federal housing grants, only to learn that Davis fabricated his federal contact and pocketed the money. Enraged, Stringer tells [[Slim Charles]] to assassinate Davis, an order which Avon immediately rescinds.

Stringer's luck takes a turn for the worse when Kintell Williamson joins the New Day Co-Op and curbs his crew's violent tendencies. At the same time, Avon's war with Marlo is ratcheting up, and McNulty backdoors Daniels and goes straight to [[Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin|Major Colvin]], in order to refocus the Major Crimes Unit on Barksdale's once-again-violent drug crew. This helps Freamon and Prez slowly gather conspiracy evidence against Stringer and his lieutenants, eventually catching Stringer making an incriminating phone call on one of his many phone lines. The Major Crimes Unit is finally ready to make a move against the Barksdale Organization, but just before warrants can be issued the organization self-destructs in an ironic turn of events.

Stringer plans to stabilize control of the Barksdale Organization by sending Avon back to prison for parole violations, betraying the location of his safe-house and armory to Colvin. However, Stringer is simultaneously betrayed by Avon when [[Brother Mouzone]] confronts him about Stringer's plot to engineer a conflict between Mouzone and [[Omar Little]]. Mouzone tells Avon that he knew Stringer had intentionally fed Omar misinformation, and that he held Avon responsible for Stringer's actions, threatening to use his connections to cut off the Barksdale organization's connections and supply of drugs from New York. In an effort to avoid a war with Mouzone, Avon reluctantly tells him Stringer's whereabouts.

Shortly after Avon's meeting with Brother Mouzone, Avon and Stringer enjoy a last drink together at Avon's harbor-side condominium. They reminisce about the past. The next day Omar and Brother Mouzone track Stringer to his development site, kill his bodyguard and, after a tense confrontation, kill him. Avon is arrested soon after.
        
With Stringer dead and Avon imprisoned along with most of his men as a result of Stringer's visit to Colvin, the Barksdale organization crumbles. Slim Charles becomes [[de facto]] leader of what remains of the crew, which he merges with Proposition Joe's drug operations. Marlo becomes the new power in West Baltimore by default.

After Stringer's death, McNulty and the police search his apartment. The apartment is extremely clean, stylishly furnished, and tastefully decorated. Far from any expectations of a drug kingpin, his bookshelf includes a copy of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. McNulty expresses regret that he could not arrest his archrival before he died. In the end, McNulty displays an odd admiration for Stringer's lofty dreams and a grudging respect for his talent as a drug kingpin. In essence, McNulty feels purposeless without his adversary, and it is this sense of aimlessness that leads him to transfer to patrol in the Western District and straighten his life out.

==Legacy==
In the season five episode &quot;Late Editions,&quot; [[Clay Davis]], while describing to [[Lester Freamon]] how drug money is routed from the kingpins to state and city politicians through their lawyers, mentions how he conned a fellow named &quot;Bell&quot; into giving him a great deal of money because Davis had convinced him that he would be able to use his connections to push his development forward quickly. As Davis laughs about how he conned Stringer, Freamon's eyes light up in recognition.&lt;ref name = &quot;OC2&quot;&gt;{{

===Publication history===
She first appeared in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #43 (June, 1980).  She was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[Mike Zeck]]. The character also appeared in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47 and 48 (October–November 1980).

Belladonna received an entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #2.

===Fictional character biography===
'''Narda Ravanna''' was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  She is a chemist and former co-owner of Vaughn-Pope Cosmetics with her sister, Desiree Vaughan-Pope. When they refuse to sell their company to billionaire and fashion designer Roderick Kingsley, he used the media to smear their products and ruin their career. Narda entered New York and took the identity of Belladonna to gain vengeance, wielding a gun that fired neo-atropine gas for knocking out foes. She gathered a team of criminal allies, and incurred the wrath of the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]].&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #47 (October 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Her assault on Kingsley was interrupted by [[Spider-Man]], who handed her, her gang and Prowler over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #48 (November 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bella Donna Boudreaux''' is a fictional character from the Marvel Comics universe who first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #8.  She was created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Scott Lobdell]].

===Publication history===
Belladonna plays a major role in the first ''Rogue'' mini-series.

===Fictional character biography===
Young street-thief Remy LeBeau met '''Bella Donna Boudreaux''' when they were only children, and the pair soon became friends. Unbeknownst to them both, they came from rival Guilds (those of Thieves and Assassins, respectively). As they grew up and the rivalry between the Guilds increased, their fathers arranged for a marriage between the two in the hopes that it would unite the Guilds. Immediately after the wedding, Bella Donna's brother, Julien, lashed out in jealousy and challenged Remy in a fight to the death. Remy won, killing Julien, and as  punishment, he was exiled from New Orleans. Choosing to make his own choices in life from that point on, he abandoned Bella Donna.

A few years later, Bella Donna sought out Gambit to help fend off the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], who were attacking the Guilds. Having persuaded Gambit and the [[X-Men]] to come back to New Orleans, they battled the new enemy with the aid of Dan Ketch, the second [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. Using her new psychic powers, Bella Donna followed [[Psylocke]] into the astral plane and expended her energy, before collapsing in Gambit's arms. Believing her dead, he told the Thieves Guild to take care of her, and went off for revenge against the Brood.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt;

As it happened, Bella Donna was not actually dead, but merely in a coma. Gambit risked his life to bring her [[Candra (comics)|Candra]]'s Elixir of Life, although while she was catatonic she was accidentally touched by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. She woke up without any recollection of who she was, or who Remy was, and he left her again.

Bella Donna's memory slowly returned, and she felt as if her soul had been violated. Enraged, she had Rogue's comatose old boyfriend Cody kidnapped and murdered, once again pitting herself against Gambit. For the third time, he left her behind.

He returned again to [[New Orleans]], ignorant to the multiple hits put up against him in the meantime. Bella Donna herself had taken one of the contracts, though she had no intention of killing him. Instead, she arranged it so that she could meet with him and sort out the conflicting emotions she had about him. After he was elected Viceroy of the Unified Guilds of New Orleans he passed power on to her, and returned to the X-Men. She now rules in his absence, still in love with him.

She briefly entered a relationship with [[Bandit (comics)|Bandit]], a former [[New Warriors]] member, eerily reminiscent of Gambit, but Gambit subsequently revealed he was manipulating her.

It has yet to be revealed whether Bella Donna has retained her mutant powers after the events of M-Day.

Bella Donna reappeared, still leading the Assassin's Guild. She dispatches a group of super-villain assassins after Domino.

Much later, she clashes with [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] who takes on the Scarlet Spider identity.

===In other media===

====Television====
Bella Donna makes her first appearance in the ''X-Men'' animated series, as an image in Gambit's past, when Professor Xavier scans Gambit's mind looking through his memories in ''X-Men'' Season 1, Episode 13 (time 7:44). Bella Donna makes her second appearance as a major character in the episode &quot;X-Ternally Yours&quot;, where she blackmails Gambit to come to her.

====Film====
Bella Donna will appear in the upcoming film ''[[X-Men (film series) #In development|Gambit]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/rebecca-ferguson-lea-seydoux-abbey-lee-gambit-x-men-120149275/|title=Rebecca Ferguson, Lea Seydoux, Abbey Lee On 'Gambit' Short List|publisher=Deadline|last=Fleming, Jr|first=Mike|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed by [[Léa Seydoux]].&lt;ref&gt;https://deadline.com/2015/08/lea-seydoux-gambit-channing-tatum-james-bond-1201504941/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belphegorpbk.png|thumb|right]]
'''''Belphégor''''' (English title ''The Mystery of the Louvre'') is a 1927 [[crime novel]] by French writer [[Arthur Bernède]], about a &quot;phantom&quot; which haunts the [[Louvre Museum]], in reality a masked villain trying to steal a hidden treasure. It was simultaneously adapted as a [[movie serial]] starring [[René Navarre]] as [[Chantecoq]], Bernède's fictional detective, and Elmire Vautier as the villainous Belphégor.

''Belphégor'' inspired several other adaptations, including an eponymous 1965 French television series starring [[Juliette Greco]] in the title role (but without Chantecoq), a 1965 [[Belphegor (comics)|daily comic strip]] sequel to the TV series, a 2001 [[Belphégor - Le fantôme du Louvre|film]] starring [[Sophie Marceau]], and a 2001 French-Canadian animated television series.

The 1966 film ''La Malédiction de Belphégor'' has nothing to do with Bernède's version and was made to cash in on the 1965 television series' popularity.

'''Noah Bennet''', also known as '''the man in [[horn-rimmed glasses]]''' (aka '''HRG''') or simply '''Mr. Bennet''', is a character from the [[NBC]] drama ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' played by [[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cast&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=TVGuide.com | title = Heroes Cast and Details | url = http://online.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=281246&amp;more=ucshowdetail | accessdate = 2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was initially recurring, but became regular as of the [[Fallout (Heroes episode)|11th episode]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting News&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work=Variety.com | title = 'Heroes' zeros in on its bad guy | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117952487.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=Heroes | accessdate = 2006-10-27 | first=Michael | last=Schneider | date=2006-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first name was not revealed until &quot;[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]]&quot;, the first season finale. Along with his adoptive daughter [[Claire Bennet|Claire]], Noah is the most frequently seen character in the series, and returned for the 2015-16 miniseries ''[[Heroes Reborn (miniseries)|Heroes Reborn]]''.

== Character overview ==
At first glance, Noah Bennet appears to be an ordinary businessman who works at the [[Primatech Paper Company]] and lives in Odessa, Texas, with his wife and two children. However, he and his associates have actually traveled the world for a number of years investigating superhuman phenomena and tracking down people with these &quot;gifts.&quot; Bennet claims that he assists them in learning to use their powers, although a flashback conversation between him and [[List of characters in Heroes#Thompson|Thompson]] reveals that he knows his job is morally questionable and that it will often produce unintended consequences; in one episode, he plainly states that he is comfortable with being morally gray. Though he is a &quot;Company Man,&quot; he deeply cares for his family and will do anything to protect them, particularly his adopted daughter Claire, and puts their safety above all else. He is also known as &quot;Glasses Man&quot;.

Bennet has had a number of associates, most notably a mysterious man most commonly known as &quot;[[The Haitian]],&quot; who has the power to prevent other heroes from exercising their powers in his presence, as well as to remove select memories from people's minds. Bennet's other known associates have been [[Eden McCain]], a woman with the power of mind control who kills herself to keep [[Sylar]] from gaining her ability; [[Characters of Heroes#Claude Rains|Claude Rains]], Bennet's first partner who has the power to turn invisible; and a romantic couple composed of [[Characters of Heroes#Hank and Lisa|Hank]], a doctor with unknown abilities and his significant other, [[Characters of Heroes#Hank and Lisa|Lisa]], who also has unknown abilities. Rains is the first person to question Bennet's actions and those of [[Company (Heroes)|The Company]]. Bennet is charged with executing Rains for his insubordination on moral grounds, but Rains escapes by literally disappearing into thin air.

Bennet's true agenda and overall affiliation are mysterious. In response to [[Matt Parkman]]'s inquiries as to whether he works for the FBI or the CIA, Bennet said he doesn't work for &quot;any organization that has initials.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collision&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Collision | episodelink = Collision (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (TV series)| credits = Director: Ernest Dickerson, Writer: Bryan Fuller | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he has worked for and against The Company and for and against [[List of characters in Heroes#Daniel Linderman|Mr. Linderman]]. These factors cloud his true allegiances. His one allegiance that is clear, however, is that to his daughter, Claire; his son, [[List of characters in Heroes#Lyle Bennet|Lyle]]; and his wife, [[List of characters in Heroes#Sandra Bennet|Sandra]]. Bennet loves his daughter profusely, but is also overprotective of her. This sometimes leads him to use his authority and associates in unsavory ways. Past, present and future events all indicate that Bennet has lied about Claire's biological origins multiple times.

According to his driving license, his previous address is 9 Juniper Lane, Odessa, Texas.  Noah Bennet speaks Japanese and also appears to speak at least some Ukrainian. Although he does not seem to possess any powers, his extensive experience in dealing with beings with superpowers allows him to be able to handle them effectively. Also, he displays considerable prowess in hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blindsided&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings ==
In the episode &quot;[[The Wall (Heroes)|The Wall]]&quot;, Samuel uses the ability of [[List of characters in Heroes#Damien|Damien]] to reveal Noah's life before joining The Company to Claire. In 1985, Noah lived in Los Angeles with his first wife [[List of characters in Heroes#Kate Bennet|Kate]] as a used car salesman. Soon after learning Kate is pregnant, the two are attacked by a telekinetic named Richard in their home resulting in Kate's death. Before wanting to find the killer, Noah develops signs of psychotic depression and paranoia before he spends the next year mapping and tracking people with abilities. After encountering one of the people he is tracking, Noah demands that he tell him where he can find Richard, but is attacked and is forced to kill him in self-defence. Soon after, Noah is approached by [[List of characters in Heroes#Eric Thompson.2C Sr.|Eric Thompson Sr.]] with an offer to join Primatech and assistance in finding Richard. After two years and several deaths on his cases Noah is encouraged by Thompson to get married to calm him so there are fewer incidents, suggesting to Noah to look at the waitress working at the restaurant, who turns out to be Sandra. Soon after, the two meet and then get married; they spend their honeymoon in [[West Berlin]], [[Germany]] where Noah acts as informant for Thompson's assignment (''[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 4|From the Files of Primatech, Part 5: 1988]]'').

In &quot;[[Company Man (Heroes)|Company Man]]&quot;, a flashback episode, it is revealed that Noah Bennet's former partner years ago was Claude, with whom he rescued Claire from the fire her biological mother caused by [[pyrokinesis]]. However, because Claude was hiding &quot;one of them&quot;, Bennet was forced to kill him. However, Claude later turned out to be alive—he had used his powers to become invisible when Bennet shot him, disappearing from view. In &quot;Company Man&quot;, an episode that takes place over 16 years before &quot;Genesis&quot;, [[List of characters in Heroes#Kaito Nakamura|Kaito Nakamura]] arranges for Noah to adopt Claire as an assignment and Bennet  [[Our Father (Heroes)|later]]  allows them to plant the catalyst of the genetic modification formula— a formula that can grant superpowers to any and all who are injected with it— into Claire's body. In [[Six Months Ago]], he turns the wanted criminal and [[mind control]]ler [[Eden McCain]] into one of his operatives. At about the same time, he is contacted by [[List of characters in Heroes#Chandra Suresh|Chandra Suresh]], who has found Claire's picture on her high school's web site after identifying her as having potential powers. After Chandra leaves, Bennet orders Eden McCain to become a neighbor of Chandra Suresh and remove Claire's name from Chandra's list of superpowered humans.

== Character history ==

=== Genesis ===
Noah Bennet first appears in &quot;[[Genesis (Heroes)|Genesis]]&quot;, the first episode. He is found in the apartment of Chandra Suresh in [[Madras]], India. Chandra's son [[Mohinder Suresh|Mohinder]] enters the apartment, but leaves quickly after realizing Bennet is there as well. Bennet seems to notice Mohinder, and later follows him to New York. There, Bennet is one of Mohinder's afternoon passengers during his job as a taxicab driver. Bennet begins pleasantly referencing his travels, and stating that he'll be happy to see his family again. The conversation turns as he mentions personal facts about Mohinder, ultimately resulting in Mohinder fleeing his own cab. Finally, Bennet comes home to Odessa and greets his family. The next morning in &quot;[[Don't Look Back (Heroes)|Don't Look Back]]&quot;, Claire states her desire to meet her biological parents. Bennet is reluctant, but doesn't outright say &quot;no.&quot; After Claire gets home from school, Bennet says he'll start contacting the adoption agency and look for her biological parents. After a happy Claire leaves the room, Bennet is seen watching a video tape of Claire demonstrating her healing abilities.

In &quot;[[Collision (Heroes)|Collision]]&quot;, Bennet is first seen standing over Matt Parkman, who is strapped to a gurney. Bennet calmly converses with Matt, advising him to relax. Bennet also checks the readout of a machine used to gauge when Parkman is trying to read Bennet's mind. Bennet explains that the Haitian is blocking Matt's powers. Nevertheless, Matt is able to pull the name &quot;Claire&quot; from Bennet's mind. Bennet is impressed by Matt's growing ability, and then tells the Haitian to &quot;go deep&quot; with Matt, who is last heard screaming. That morning, back at the Bennet house, Bennet finds that a distraught Claire has just come home. Bennet assumes from Claire's bare, mud-covered feet that she was out all night. Bennet has to get to work, but states that they'll talk later. He is then seen monitoring [[Nathan Petrelli]], who has just had a one-night stand with [[Niki Sanders|Niki/Jessica Sanders]]. Bennet tells the Haitian to kidnap &quot;just the one&quot; (Nathan).

In the next episode, &quot;[[Hiros]]&quot;, Bennet and the Haitian attempt to force Nathan into a car, but he escapes by flying away. Bennet is then seen at Texas hospital visiting Claire. Claire explains that Brody is a rapist and attempted to force himself on her. After speaking to one of his victims, Claire was motivated to do something. She only wanted to &quot;scare&quot; Brody, but as he sat in the passenger seat and said he wouldn't stop raping girls, she ultimately crashed his car intentionally. Claire begs her father not to tell anyone, and Bennet merely says he'll take care of it. Bennet then appears in Brody's room, followed by the Haitian. He says that she is going through 'a confusing time', telling that he knows of her powers. He tells the boy that he is being given a chance to start over in life and Bennet then tells the Haitian to &quot;hollow him out&quot; and &quot;take everything&quot; (erase all of Brody's memories, including that of his own name).

Finally, in &quot;[[Better Halves]]&quot;, Bennet has set up a meeting between Claire and his two associates, Hank and Lisa. Bennet presents the two as Claire's biological parents. While carefully watching the two with his wife Sandra, Bennet receives a call from Eden McCain, his spy in New York. Eden relays information about Mohinder, [[Isaac Mendez]] (&quot;the precog&quot;) and the message &quot;save the cheerleader, save the world.&quot; Bennet is disturbed by the last part, but regains his composure. Bennet tells Eden to prevent Mohinder from leaving New York and to &quot;bring in the precog.&quot; After Hank and Lisa exit the Bennet home, Noah Bennet follows the two outside and thanks them for their service. At this point his wife, Sandra, lets slip to Claire that they'd had problems finding her parents in the past and that she was surprised that Noah Bennet managed to do it now.

Bennet asks Isaac, whom Eden &quot;persuaded&quot; to come with her, to help him to prevent Claire from being murdered by [[Sylar]] at her homecoming game the next night. Bennet has collected three previous paintings Isaac created depicting a terrified Claire close-up, running up the bleachers in a football stadium, and lying dead on the ground with the top of her skull removed. When Isaac is unable to paint without the use of heroin and resists taking the drug, Bennet orders Eden to use her powers to make Isaac believe he wants to use the drug.

Bennet becomes frustrated after Isaac is unable to paint something that makes sense to him. When Eden protests his actions, Bennet shows her a series of photographs depicting Sylar's dead victims—all with their brains removed from their heads—and says he is determined to save his daughter from such a fate. He orders Eden to go to the homecoming game and look for Sylar and grounds Claire to prevent her from being killed. Bennet discovers later, however, that Claire snuck out and worriedly runs to the school to find her. When he arrives, he is too late to stop Sylar from attacking the cheerleader in the pictures. Bennet soon discovers that the victim was not Claire; rather, it was [[List of characters in Heroes#Jackie Wilcox|Jackie Wilcox]], one of Claire's fellow cheerleaders. A relatively relieved Bennet soon reunites with his daughter and insists they go home while the police handle things. Claire says that she has something to tell her father regarding her uncanny survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homecoming&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Homecoming | episodelink = Homecoming (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (TV series)| credits = Director: Greg Beeman, Writer: Adam Armus &amp; Kay Foster | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode &quot;[[Fallout (Heroes)|Fallout]]&quot;, Claire's father reveals that he knew about her powers long before she was aware of them. He acknowledges doing things he was not proud of to keep her safe, and tells Claire that Sylar had been taken care of, but that she must keep silent about her powers because she is in danger from others like him. Bennet later meets with Sylar, confined in a prison cell, and tells him that the cell is keeping his powers suppressed. Sylar taunts Bennet telling him that Bennet is just like him.  In their next confrontation Bennet turns the taunt back at Sylar telling him how they plan to study him to determine what makes him &quot;tick.&quot; Sylar boasts that he would escape and kill Claire, taking her healing abilities. Eden suggests using her powers to persuade Sylar to kill himself, but Bennet declines (though briefly tempted), as he takes orders from someone higher up. Bennet later takes Claire to the police station, where she is interviewed about Jackie's murder. Officer Parkman is unable to read the thoughts of Claire or her father, since the Haitian is hiding behind a nearby corner. Afterwards, Bennet orders the Haitian to wipe the memories of his son and Claire's friend, Zach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallout&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Fallout | episodelink = Fallout (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (TV series)| credits = Director: John Badham, Writer: Joe Pokaski | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Claire finds out that the two of them have lost all memory of her powers she rings her father in a panic.  It is left open whether it is only then that he orders the Haitian to wipe Claire's memories or whether he has already done so.

In &quot;[[Godsend (Heroes)|Godsend]]&quot;, Bennet believes Claire's memory has been erased. Claire acts as if it has, as well. However, Bennet and Claire are slowly drifting apart. At Primatech Paper, the FBI investigates the building as well as Bennet and his associates. Though they find nothing, Officer Parkman knows Bennet's up to something and has realized that Bennet kidnapped him. Bennet is unfazed, however, and simply tells Matt &quot;good luck&quot; in regards to his vendetta.

Next, Bennet shows up at the apartment of Mohinder Suresh in New York. Mohinder is defensive, recalling Bennet's past actions. However, Bennet means him no harm, and even mentions Eden. Soon, he makes a proposition. Bennet tells Mohinder that together they could make a difference, and asks Mohinder to join him. Mohinder says he isn't interested, but Bennet leaves his card anyway.

Bennet returns to Sylar's holding area in &quot;[[The Fix (Heroes)|The Fix]]&quot;. There, he finds Hank telling him that Sylar's vital signs are highly irregular and he may be dying. Bennet tells Hank to keep him alive, referencing orders from his superiors to that effect. Furthermore, he states that Sylar will &quot;die on [Bennet's] terms,&quot; not his own. At home, Bennet finds Claire and Zach are &quot;working on a school project&quot; together, according to Claire. Claire also acts as if she'd rather not spend time with Zach.  Bennet, however, tells her that she had been friends and encourages her to see if they might not find something in common. After Zach and she go upstairs, Bennet gets a call from Hank. Hank states that Sylar has died, which Bennet replies is &quot;less than ideal.&quot; Bennet then tells Hank to prepare Sylar &quot;for shipping.&quot; Back at Sylar's cell, Bennet finds the body of a dead Hank where Sylar should be. Bennet then turns around to find Sylar calmly standing in front of him. Sylar asks about Claire, then states his intentions to kill her. After telekinetically throwing Bennet against a wall and playing with the lights, Sylar leaves Bennet trapped in the cell. Later, at the Bennet home, he and the Haitian narrowly save Sandra from Sylar. Although Sylar escapes, Bennet is confident he will catch the killer. After the Haitian wipes Sandra's memories yet again, Bennet is called by Isaac Mendez. Mendez is revealed to be working with Bennet, as he relays information about [[Peter Petrelli]].

In &quot;[[Unexpected (Heroes)|Unexpected]]&quot;, Bennet and the Haitian manage to track down Peter and Claude. They fire [[Taser]]s at Claude, but Peter unexpectedly utilizes his powers to stop the electrodes and fly away from them. Bennet is then called by Claire, who tells him that Sandra has collapsed for unknown reasons. Bennet heads back home, and is confronted by Claire in the hospital, where she reveals that she remembers everything that the Haitian was supposed to erase. Afterwards, the Bennet family returns home, where they are confronted by [[Ted Sprague]] and Matt Parkman.

The episode &quot;Company Man&quot; begins with the hostage-taking of the Bennet family by Sprague and Parkman, who are in search of answers. Noah Bennet has revelations about his company during this situation, showing that he initially came to work for &quot;The Company&quot; under the supervision of a man named Thompson, and partnered with Claude. He is eventually ordered to kill Claude, because Claude apparently was hiding &quot;one of them&quot; from The Company. During the confrontation with Sprague, Thompson comes through the back door and shoots Ted, who goes into an uncontrolled radioactive state. Noah Bennet and Matt escape the house, while Claire tranquilizes Sprague. After this, Matt and Ted are taken to the paper factory. Thompson asks Bennet when Claire should be showing up at the factory. It is at that moment that Bennet realizes he's too attached to Claire. The graphic novel &quot;[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 1|Family Man]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/downloads/Heroes_novel_023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that, at this point, Noah Bennet decides that he must do what he can to save Claire and &quot;bring down the people [he] work[s] for.&quot; Having noticed that he is being followed by someone from The Company, Noah Bennet drives to a cybercafé and sends a message to [[Hana Gitelman|Hana]] asking for help, which she agrees to do. The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then &quot;Go deep&quot; and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead &quot;them&quot; to Claire. The Haitian follows the order, then takes Claire away to protect her, as instructed.

In &quot;[[Parasite (Heroes)|Parasite]]&quot;, Bennet is questioned by Thompson; he claims that the last thing he remembers is driving home Sandra from the hospital. Later, before Noah Bennet is about to leave on business, Sandra tells him that she is only pretending to have had her mind wiped, as he told her to do; and that he had told her everything about what he really did, who he works for, and what happened to Claire. She gives him a note that he left for himself, warning him not to look for Claire because she is with friends. Then, Bennet and Candice travel to New York to &quot;clean up&quot; Isaac's mess. Upon his return home, Bennet tells Sandra that they both have to pretend that they have no idea what has happened, and that Primatech has to be stopped for good to ensure Claire's safety. &quot;Sandra&quot; then transforms back into Candice, and other members of the Company, including Thompson, enter the room behind her.

In &quot;[[.07%]]&quot;, Bennet is now in the custody of Primatech, in a solitary cell. His will to protect Claire is challenged by Candice, who shapeshifts into Claire's form; Bennet recognizes the ruse right away and tells her and Thompson that he does not know where Claire is and will never give her up to them.  Thompson threatens to kill Bennet, but Bennet notes that if they really wanted him dead, they'd have killed him by now.  Thompson tells Bennet that he is merely waiting on orders to do so.

Realizing that the only hope of stopping Thompson and his superiors will be to escape from Primatech, Bennet telepathically gives instructions to Matt Parkman, who is also being held prisoner, on how to break out of his cell.  Matt is then told to fetch Sprague from his cell so that Sprague can generate an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] to shut down the power at Primatech, which will then allow them to break Bennet out of his cell.  Matt is reluctant to go along with the plan, and Sprague doesn't trust Bennet, but eventually the three of them work together to escape.

Over breakfast at the Burnt Toast Diner, Bennet reveals that the only way to stop Thompson is to get to New York City to destroy the tracking device that tracks heroes tagged with the neck tattoo, and he produces bus tickets to take them there.  When Matt asks if Mr. Linderman is in New York, Bennet seems surprised by Matt's knowledge of the name.  Matt guesses correctly that Bennet was &quot;middle management&quot; and is somewhat incredulous that Bennet seems not to know who was signing his paychecks all those years.  Bennet tells Matt to forget about Linderman and that it is more important that they get to New York and destroy the tracker.  Sprague casts the deciding vote to go to New York City, and Matt reluctantly agrees to join them on their destination.

After escaping from Primatech Paper with Sprague and Parkman, the three of them head for New York to destroy the tracking system and the company. In &quot;[[The Hard Part]]&quot;, Bennet, Parkman and Sprague steal a car and head for New York. Bennet reveals that the Company has a new tracking system called the Walker system. He reveals that this system doesn't need radio isotopes or tracers to find you; it just knows where you are. Unbeknownst to Bennet, the Walker tracker system is later revealed to be [[Molly Walker]], who has the ability to mentally find anyone in the world, just by thinking about them.

The three arrive at Kirby Plaza, where [[Micah Sanders]] and Molly Walker are located.  Claire sees the trio coming, and father and daughter reunite. Peter then notices his hands beginning to glow. Bennet realizes that Peter is absorbing Ted's power, and Peter and Claire look at each other worriedly.

After Peter controls himself, the group splits in two, with Peter, Claire, and Sprague going to a remote town in Nebraska, and Parkman and Bennet continuing with their mission to destroy the tracking system. Bennet knows where they need to go, but he needs Parkman's powers to allow them access. Matt confronts a security guard and convinces him that they know each other and had spoken outside of work the previous night. Upon revealing an embarrassing secret of the guard's, the man lets them in without hesitation.

While waiting for the elevator, they bump into Jessica and D.L., with Jessica surprised to see Matt still alive. The four go up in the elevator together, with Bennet telling them where to find Linderman. Bennet and Parkman then get off at the floor where the tracking system is, only to find Thompson waiting for them. Parkman saves Bennet from getting shot, only to have Bennet leave him defenseless against Thompson. Thompson then comes up behind Parkman, puts a gun to his head, and asks him, &quot;What am I thinking now, Parkman?&quot; Bennet comes from the side and says, &quot;Your last thought.&quot; killing Thompson with two point blank gunshots to the head.

The two then proceed to find the tracking system, where both are surprised to find it's a young girl — though only Matt is completely surprised: Bennet claims he knew it was a person, just not a little girl — whom Matt had previously rescued from Sylar, and who thought of Matt as &quot;my hero.&quot; Matt protests killing her, but Bennet says it must be done in order to save the others. The two continue to argue until Matt is suddenly knocked out by Mohinder from behind. The episode ends with Mohinder pointing a gun on Bennet while the latter points his gun on Molly, both men threatening to shoot.

Parkman wakes up, ending the standoff. Bennet asks Molly to locate Sylar, which she does - he's nearby.

He later finds Peter after he passed out from nearly exploding, thanks him for saving Claire and agrees to kill him if it comes to that. He also reveals his first name, telling Peter to &quot;Call me Noah.&quot;

In the climax of &quot;[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]],&quot; Peter, Noah, and Matt confront Sylar in the plaza. Bennet is immediately thrown against a wall, rendering him incapable of stopping Peter if he explodes.

=== Generations ===
[[Four Months Later...|Four months after]] the incidents in New York, the Bennets have gone into hiding, having moved to Costa Verde, California, and assumed the last name of &quot;Butler.&quot; Noah takes a subordinate job at a copy store called Copy Kingdom, and makes it very clear that he won't stand for his younger superior's bullying management style. Despite going into hiding, he is still working to take down &quot;the Company&quot; with the help of [[Mohinder Suresh]].

In &quot;[[Lizards (Heroes)|Lizards]]&quot;, Noah tells his wife about a series of eight paintings done by the late [[Isaac Mendez]], each depicting the death of a single person. He possesses the first, which predicts the death of [[Kaito Nakamura (Heroes)|Kaito Nakamura]], and intends to locate the other seven. At the end of the episode, Noah is reunited with the Haitian; the accompanying graphic novel shows that Mohinder directed the Haitian to Bennet.

In &quot;[[Kindred (Heroes)|Kindred]]&quot;, Mohinder finds the last of the eight paintings, this one depicting Noah's death. He is lying on the ground with a bullet hole through the left lens of his glasses. A girl resembling Claire is in the background, apparently being held by someone.

In &quot;[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]&quot;, Noah and the Haitian travel to [[Odessa|Odessa, Ukraine]], to find the remaining paintings. While there, he receives a call from Mohinder explaining that Molly Walker has fallen into a catatonic state and he wishes to take her to the Company for observation. Noah is unable to talk him out of it, though he warns that they'll have Mohinder as soon as he relinquishes that which he cares about.

In &quot;[[The Line (Heroes)|The Line]]&quot;, Noah tracks down his old mentor, Ivan. He has the Haitian remove precious memories (marriage day, kids being born, etc.) from the old man one by one until Ivan succumbs and reveals where the paintings are. Knowing that his method of interrogation, as well as trying to use the Haitian to cover his tracks, will alert the Company, he instead opts to kill his mentor, making the affair appear to be a simple home invasion.

In &quot;[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]&quot;, Noah and Suresh attempt to make sense of the paintings Noah and the Haitian have just found. The one in question is a painting of Suresh holding a [[The Company (Heroes)|Company]]-issue gun that has just been fired. Noah takes pictures of the paintings in an effort to send them to Suresh, but Suresh refuses stating his life may be in danger. Afterwards, Noah and the Haitian burn the entire collection and Noah returns home. West has dropped by without notice that same morning and made breakfast for Claire. As Noah walks into the house, West sees Noah and remembers who he is. West runs outside and abruptly flies away without being seen by Noah. Having left behind a newspaper detailing the incident with the drunk cheerleader, it ends up in hand of Noah, who sees it as a threat to the family. He confronts Claire and tells her she is putting the life of their family in danger. Furthermore, he tells her and the family to pack their things, and they are leaving immediately. Claire then calls her father out, stating that he was not being honest about his &quot;trip&quot; he took for &quot;management training&quot;. Claire defiantly tells her father that she is not moving anywhere else and walks out of the room.

In &quot;[[Cautionary Tales (Heroes)|Cautionary Tales]]&quot;, Bob, Elle, and Mohinder arrive in Costa Verde to take Claire. Though they are eventually successful, Noah manages to capture Elle. Noah brokers a trade with Bob, getting his daughter back in exchange for Bob's. When Elle breaks free and tries to kill West and Claire, Noah shoots her in the arm. He then prepares to execute Bob, citing that Claire will never be free so long as the Company survives. But Mohinder shoots Noah, mimicking Isaac's painting exactly, and Noah is struck in the left eye and dies. While his family believes him to be dead, the episode ends with Noah in a Company facility, strapped to a gurney and being given a transfusion of Claire's blood; his destroyed eye subsequently regenerates and he returns to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/episodes/season2/209/cautionary_tales_13.shtml#recap|title=Heroes: Find Heroes Episode Recaps Online|author=NBC|date=2007-11-19|accessdate=2007-11-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071121123928/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/episodes/season2/209/cautionary_tales_13.shtml#recap &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Truth &amp; Consequences]]&quot;, [[Mohinder Suresh|Mohinder]] tells him that he was revived with Claire's blood and that Claire is at home, thinking he is dead. During the episode, with Noah still in the hands of The Company, Bob visits the Bennets' home with an urn telling them that it contains Noah's ashes.

In &quot;[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]&quot;, Noah returns to his family, clearly shocking them all as he is allegedly dead. He tells them that he was brought back using Claire's blood, and that he made a deal with The Company which will allow his family to lead a normal life with one condition; he must stay with the Company. Noah then leaves his family.

=== Villains ===
In &quot;[[The Butterfly Effect (Heroes)|The Butterfly Effect]]&quot;, Noah is imprisoned by the Company. Elle releases him from his cell so that he can help in the apprehension of Sylar during the attack on the Level 5 facility. After Elle inadvertently knocks out [[Sylar]] and causes a breakdown of the complex security system, Noah---fearing the worst after seeing Sylar demonstrate Claire's ability---places [[Sylar]] in a cell and makes his own escape.  Later, when Noah visits the house and sees Claire alive but traumatized, he explains that he cannot stay as he has to recapture the [[superhuman]]s who escaped during Sylar's attack, stating ''&quot;They're villains, Claire, and I'm one of the only people on the planet who knows how to stop them,&quot;'' and even showing her some info on the escapees. Before leaving, Noah tells her that he's enlisted Claire's biological mom, the pyrokinetic [[Meredith Gordon]], to help protect the family.

Going back to the Company to bring the escapees in, Noah, on orders from new CEO [[Angela Petrelli]], is partnered with Sylar, much to his chagrin. When they arrive at the bank where a group of escapees are causing trouble, Noah orders Sylar to stay out of his way and let him handle the escapees, but Sylar uses his sharp tongue to convince the police that they are [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents so they can get through. Noah manages to free the hostages, but is then taken hostage himself. Just as Knox and Jesse Murphy (now free of [[Peter Petrelli|Peter]]'s influence) are about to start beating him up, [[Sylar]] enters and stops them both with his telekinesis, also neutralizing Jesse's power. Noah reminds him of the &quot;plan&quot;, and [[Sylar]] replies &quot;You just said that to make sure I didn't.&quot; Soon afterwards, Sylar loses control, locks Noah out of the bank, and kills Jesse for his power, allowing Knox to escape. Back at Level 5, Noah mentions to the Haitian that he only plans to be partnered with Sylar long enough to ascertain a weakness, to which then he'll kill him. When he chastises Sylar for the death of Jesse, he merely states that &quot;rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight.&quot;

Later on, he and Sylar arrive at the home of Stephen Canfield and discover Claire there, having already attempted to capture him, only to find out that he is not truly evil. After Canfield opens up a [[vortex]], which Claire, Noah, and Sylar barely avoid getting sucked into, and escapes, Noah orders Sylar to shut up after he attempts to apologize for what he did, and Claire tells him of Canfield's true colors. He assures her that he would not put someone in Level 5 who didn't belong there, and Claire tells him about Canfield's whereabouts.

When they find Canfield, Noah attempts to force him to kill Sylar in exchange for his freedom, clearly convinced that Sylar cannot be redeemed, but Canfield instead opens up a vortex and sucks himself in, preferring death to becoming a monster. Noah and Sylar take Claire home, and the former assures her that he only does these things to protect her.

When Claire, Meredith, and Sandra take down the puppet man Eric Doyle, they call Noah to take him in. Noah is impressed that Claire was able to help take out a very dangerous man, but Claire brushes him off, still angry with him about the Canfield incident and his partnership with Sylar. Noah then asks Meredith to accompany him as a partner.

Following a phone call from Nathan Petrelli in &quot;[[Eris Quod Sum]]&quot;, he and Meredith travel to Mohinder Suresh's laboratory in the loft of Isaac Mendez, where he advises Nathan and [[Tracy Strauss]] to get checked out by the Company.

In &quot;[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse]]&quot;, when Pinehearst begins looking for the catalyst needed to perfect Mohinder's genetic modification formula, which is assumed to be Claire, Noah goes into hiding with her at the now-abandoned Canfield house and begins to teach her how to fight, but the father-daughter duo are soon attacked by Sylar and Elle. As their (and everyone else's) powers are negated due to a [[solar eclipse]], Noah is more than a match for them, even dislocating Sylar's arm, but is ultimately forced to retreat when Claire takes a bullet from Elle that was meant for him. Angered and worried, Noah takes her home where he and Sandra treat her wound, and he decides against going to a hospital, believing it to be minor and unwilling to take the risk of her powers returning while they are there. He then leaves to get revenge on Sylar and Elle for Claire's injury.

Noah tracks Sylar and Elle down at the Canfield household and watches them have sex through the scope of a [[sniper rifle]]. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks into the house and shoots at them with a Company [[handgun]], hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult (''&quot;Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody.&quot;''), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet household and are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on [[Decapitation|decapitating]] him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when [[List of characters in Heroes#Kaito Nakamura|his father]] first assigned Noah to protect her.

When Claire is returned to the present by [[List of characters in Heroes#Arthur Petrelli|Arthur Petrelli]], she, Noah, Meredith, and Angela are trapped in Primatech when Sylar initiates the [[lockdown]] mode. Noah sends three escaped Level 5 inmates ([[List of characters in Heroes#Echo DeMille|Echo DeMille]], Eric Doyle, and [[List of characters in Heroes#Daniel Pine|Danny Pine]]) after Sylar as bait, promising freedom to the first one to kill Sylar. However, Echo and Danny are killed by Sylar, and Doyle is incapacitated. Soon afterwards, Noah is led into a trap by Sylar, who locks him in a cell with Meredith, who has been injected with [[adrenaline]], her ability becoming increasingly uncontrollable, and leaves him with a handgun with one bullet. Sylar tells him that he will have to choose between killing Meredith to save himself and explaining her death to Claire, or doing nothing and being burnt to death. However, Claire arrives at that moment, and Meredith, as per Noah's orders, [[Superheating|superheats]] the [[bulletproof]] glass of the cell to weaken it, and then Noah shoots the glass to no avail. Claire then bodily throws herself through the window to help Noah escape, which he does. After Claire &quot;kills&quot; Sylar, she escapes with Noah and Angela just as Meredith finally loses control of her ability and unleashes a massive explosion. Afterwards, Noah comforts a tearful Claire as they watch Primatech burn to the ground.

=== Fugitives ===
In &quot;[[A Clear and Present Danger]]&quot;, Noah is seen to be working with Nathan Petrelli. When Mohinder Suresh is running away from Homeland Security, Noah arrives in a SUV and rescues him. As they escape, Noah asks him who he’s been in contact with. They get to the exit only to discover that the hunter and his men have cut them off. Noah apologizes and then tasers Mohinder. When Peter Petrelli arrives at his apartment, Nathan is waiting for him. After he and Peter talk, Nathan smiles and asks for a hug, and Noah tasers Peter from behind. At the end of the episode, Noah is revealed to be the co-pilot of the cargo plane.

In &quot;[[Trust and Blood]]&quot;, Noah survives the crash of the plane like almost everyone else. He is retrieved by Danko and his soldiers. Bennet chases after the captured heroes and finds Claire and Peter running together. Bennet quickly grabs Claire but wants to shoot Peter, but Claire manages to convince Bennet to let Peter run. Bennet takes Claire back to Nathan. However, after a brief interrogation, Claire gets rescued by Daphne and she gets reunited with Hiro, Ando, Mohinder and Matt. Though Danko's soldiers quickly find Claire and her friends and shoot Daphne. Matt then uses his powers to take over the soldiers and have them kill themselves. Danko wants to shoot Matt, but Claire takes the bullets for him and gets arrested instead while the others flee. Nathan and Bennet finally convince Claire to return home to Costa Verde, where her mom is revealed to think Claire just spent 2 days looking to college brochures. Bennet in the meantime stays behind looking for the fugitives. When having another shot to take down both Tracy Strauss and Peter, Bennet again chooses not to shoot down Peter and allowing him to escape. After arresting Tracy, Nathan even thanks Bennet for it.

In &quot;[[Building 26]]&quot; Claire reveals to her mother Sandra that Noah has been hunting down individuals with powers, and Sandra forces him to move out.  He tells Claire that he will be around, and expresses a desire to be more honest with the family.  He is later shown at a bar, where he is drugged and kidnapped by [[Peter Petrelli]], [[Matt Parkman]], and [[Mohinder Suresh]].

In &quot;[[Cold Wars]]&quot; Noah is being interrogated by Matt Parkman, Mohinder Suresh, and Peter Petrelli. Matt Parkman manages to pluck out memories at the expense of Noah being in pain, learning about the operation hunting people with abilities, this is also where we lurn Noah is colorblind.  Noah is rescued by Danko's men, and tells Danko that he will henceforth cooperate with Danko's more heavy-handed approach to their job.  However, he later meets with Angela Petrelli, where it is implied that he is working with her against Danko.  Their precise goals are unclear.

In &quot;[[Shades of Gray (Heroes)|Shades of Gray]]&quot;, Nathan fires Danko as his second-in-command and appoints Noah to the position. Noah takes a call from Claire, who is asking how he managed to live a two-faced life for all this time, but Noah simply tells her he is the worst person to ask, and because she doesn't know which path to take, he doesn't know either. He later warns Angela that Danko is coming for her, but Angela says she is prepared. When Danko witnesses Nathan's ability of flight, he demands to know if Noah knew about it.

In &quot;[[Turn and Face the Strange]]&quot;, Noah is accosted by Sandra in his hotel room, where she forces divorce papers on him and tells him she doesn't love him anymore. Noah discovers that she isn't really &quot;Sandra,&quot; but Sylar pretending to be her, as &quot;Sandra's&quot; signature on the papers is different from all of her other signatures. Discovering this, Noah confronts who he believes to be Sylar masquerading as Sandra in his hotel room, only to discover that it's the real Sandra, who is now scared to death of him and orders him out of the room. After being branded insane by Danko and his men, Noah is forced to run for his life and leave the operation. He is next seen driving up to Coyote Sands, meeting up with [[Claire Bennet|Claire]] and the Petrelli family.

In &quot;[[1961 (Heroes)|1961]]&quot;, he is seen digging graves in &quot;Coyote Sands&quot; alongside with Claire, Peter and Nathan by orders of Angela, due to her dreams about finding her sister. When the sandstorm hits the place, he is out looking for Claire and then is taken down by Mohinder, who later explains his father's involving in the relocation project. After finding and losing [[List of characters in Heroes#Alice Shaw|Alice]] again, he is seen together with Claire and the Petrelli family eating at a diner, when Angela decide they should form a new company; minutes later, they witness another Nathan at a live press conference, and Noah recognize him as Sylar.

Followed in &quot;[[I Am Sylar]]&quot;, as Nathan leaves the diner and Peter follows him, Noah, Claire and Angela decide to leave too, only to be intercepted in the road by Danko's agents.

In &quot;[[An Invisible Thread]]&quot;, Noah is captured by the agents operating Building 26 shortly before Danko is framed for murdering several of his soldiers by Sylar. While captured, the two share a brief discussion about forming a partnership, which is ultimately short-lived. Once the two are freed from their cell by Hiro Nakamura, Danko waits for Noah to reveal what he knows about Sylar's plans and attempts to tranquilize him. Saved by Hiro, Noah intercepts Claire and Peter shortly after their encounter with Sylar and assists in convincing the Secret Service to help Peter save the President. Later, once Sylar is defeated, he works with Angela Petrelli and Matt Parkman to bring Nathan's personality to the forefront of Sylar's mind, thereby allowing Sylar to assume Nathan's life posthumously. After disbanding Building 26's personnel, the money is reallocated on &quot;Nathan&quot; and Noah's advice by the President into a new supervisory branch. When asked what to call this branch, Noah suggests, &quot;The Company.&quot;

=== Redemption ===

In the wake of the events from &quot;[[An Invisible Thread]]&quot;, &quot;[[Orientation (Heroes)|Orientation]] and [[Jump, Push, Fall]]&quot; shows that Noah Bennet has begun to revive the Company under the auspices of the United States government, but with a slow start. [[Tracy Strauss]] is still unaccounted for and appears to be murdering anyone who had a hand in her incarceration.

Despite her attempt on his life, which Bennet survived with the help of Emile Danko, he refuses to start hunting down superhumans as a vigilante, preferring instead to try and start the new Company under better pretenses. While eating in the restaurant underneath his apartment, [[Tracy Strauss]] approaches him, apparently to taunt him of his impending death. However, Bennet offers her a unique opportunity to simply walk away; if she does, he pledges to get Danko off her trail—permanently. After recruiting [[The Haitian]] to erase Danko's memories, Tracy shows up to kill him, only to find that Danko no longer remembers her. As she leaves, she hears Danko being attacked by an unknown assailant, Edgar, from the carnival, only to be attacked herself. Afterwards, she calls Bennet who discovers a key the assailant was after on Danko's body.

Throughout these events, Bennet also tries to help [[Claire Bennet|Claire]] adjust to her new life in college while managing his own divorce from Sandra.

Bennet calls [[Peter Petrelli]] to help him check out the safe deposit box that it opens, which Peter agrees to for the opportunity to gain the attacker's power of super speed. They are attacked only once they find a single, antique compass in the safe deposit box, though Peter gains the upper hand and forces a retreat. Afterwards, Bennet holds onto the compass halfheartedly, feeling that it is a dead end.

After being attacked later for the compass and barely surviving it, Noah calls Tracy both to talk about her new adjustments and for her company. The two share a meal together that Peter left behind to console Noah.

In &quot;[[Acceptance (Heroes)|Acceptance]]&quot;, after a visiting Claire imparts some sage advice, Noah begins to realize that he wants to return to doing what he's good at, namely investigating superhumans. Then, Tracy seeks Noah advice as well, and he gives her the same message Claire told him: return to the basics to understand where to go from there.

In &quot;[[Tabula Rasa (Heroes)|Tabula Rasa]]&quot;, Peter comes to Noah looking for a healer to save [[Hiro Nakamura|Hiro]]'s life; Noah drops the name of [[List of characters in Heroes#Jeremy Greer|Jeremy Greer]], a past target of a bag &amp; tag mission, so both teleport to ''Cainan, GA''. After finding Jeremy's power change from heal to kill when he got angry at his parents, killing them, Noah helps him conquering his fear of killing anyone else, and then he is able to heal Peter; Noah states that his own power is to understand people with abilities. Peter leaves once he mimicked Jeremy's healing touch, but Noah stays to assure Jeremy will get the help he needs, mainly because Noah feels he let Jeremy down in the past.

In &quot;[[Strange Attractors]]&quot;, despite Noah's effort to cover up Jeremy's parents death, the local sheriff holds him, so Noah enlists Tracy Strauss to help Jeremy start over. Once Jeremy is out, the townspeople believe Jeremy is guilty of charge, and frightened by them Jeremy accidentally kills a man, so he is taken by the police again, away from Noah and Tracy. They come across his dead body that night and lament their failure. Tracy tells Noah to never call her again, and both agree to go their separate ways.

In &quot;[[Once Upon a Time in Texas]]&quot;, 3 years ago, during the time he worked for [[Company (Heroes)|Primatech Paper]] as the events of Volume One &quot;Genesis&quot; unfold (''[[Seven Minutes to Midnight (Heroes)|Seven Minutes to Midnight]]''), Noah is shown to share a special bond with fellow company agent [[List of characters in Heroes#Lauren Gilmore|Lauren Gilmore]], who was his confidante when Noah cannot tell his family about what his job really entails, especially [[Isaac Mendez|Isaac]]'s paintings involving Claire. Noah and Lauren share a kiss at Lauren's motel room while wrapped in a romantic moment, however Noah stops the kiss, feeling that he is cheating on [[#Sandra Bennet|Sandra]], and he and Lauren apologize for letting it get out of hand. Once back at the headquarters, Lauren gives him an envelope, in which he finds a note from her telling she got [[the Haitian]] mind-wiped any memory of her crush on Noah, so they could work together without any concern, and then writes a note to Noah to let him know this.

In &quot;[[Shadowboxing (Heroes)|Shadowboxing]]&quot;, Noah appears at [[List of characters in Heroes#Rebecca Taylor|Becky]]'s sorority house with the Haitian. Claire notices her friends have been mind-wiped and argues with Noah about what he is able to do with people around her, fearing they will erased Gretchen's memory as well. Once Claire and the Haitian go to check on Gretchen, Noah is out to find Becky at her room, and despite her being invisible, he states he knows how to deal with her because he once had an invisible partner (''[[List of characters in Heroes#Claude Rains|Claude]]''). Becky confesses why she attacked Claire; Noah killed her father while she was a kid during a bag &amp; tag mission. Noah misses her when two girls enter the room. Back to Claire, he found [[Samuel Sullivan]] with her. Getting protective, he handcuffs Samuel, but Becky comes in taking down Claire and Noah. Samuel takes Noah's taser and shocks Becky stating he knows she is messed up. Noah tries to attack him, pushing Claire away. After Samuel and Becky are gone, Noah apologizes to Claire, and then leaves. Once at his apartment, he looks at several files labeled to being Samuel's including the mysterious sinkhole that destroyed a manor (''[[Ink (Heroes)|Ink]]'').

In &quot;[[Brother's Keeper (Heroes)|Brother's Keeper]]&quot;, Noah gets home to find Claire and Tracy sharing a quality moment, and notices a frozen foot at the coffee table. Both girls state nothing happened.

In &quot;[[Thanksgiving (Heroes)|Thanksgiving]]&quot;, Noah invites Claire to his first Thanksgiving dinner so he won't be alone with Sandra and her new boyfriend. At the grocery store, he runs into [[List of characters in Heroes#Lauren Gilmore|Lauren Gilmore]], whom he jokingly admits to be &quot;stalking&quot;; she then helps Noah shopping. Once Claire arrives at Noah's apartment, Claire notices Lauren, referring to her as Noah's date, which he refutes; once Sandra and Doug arrive, Sandra mistakes Lauren for a maid; after correction, Sandra believes Lauren to be Noah's date too. During dinner, Claire confesses her decision to drop out college, which Noah is immediately opposed to. After Claire cuts herself and Doug faints, she and Noah discuss the clippings on Noah's wall; Noah insists Samuel and the carnival are dangerous and shows her the compass. Gretchen then appears, and tells Claire she was invited by Noah as Claire was feeling bad those days. Once everyone is leaving, Noah assures Claire she has many options, unknowing she later takes this advice to visit the carnival. Before leaving, Lauren asks Noah to go out and watch a movie some day.

In &quot;[[The Fifth Stage]]&quot;, Lauren appears at Noah's apartment ready to go out in their date, but Noah noticed Claire took the compass and must be heading to the &quot;Sullivan Bros. Carnival&quot;, so Lauren decides to help him using her CIA contacts. Later that night, [[#Eli|Eli]] shows up at the place looking for the Primatech files, surrounding Lauren and Noah with clones; both attack the clones and hide in the bathroom to arm themselves. Once out again, they notice Eli and clones are gone, and they took the files with them.

In &quot;[[Upon This Rock (Heroes)|Upon This Rock]]&quot;, Noah is seen at Nathan's funeral.

In &quot;[[Let It Bleed]]&quot;, Noah offers to take Claire to Nathan's wake but she becomes upset with him and realizes that Sylar killed Nathan and Noah transformed Sylar into Nathan. Noah admits that he did the wrong thing and that he thought he did it to keep Sylar detained and Nathan alive at the same time but Claire is angry and tells him she needs some to time to grieve, without being reminded of the truth.

In &quot;[[The Wall (Heroes)|The Wall]],&quot; in order to turn Claire against her father, Samuel has Damien use his powers to project Noah's memories in the House of Mirrors.  It's shown that Noah started out as a too-honest used-car salesman who had a pregnant wife until she was killed by a man with telekinetic powers during a robbery which sent Noah after him looking for revenge.  He also becomes a lot less honest.  When he finds a man with powers, Noah demands the location of the killer's location which the man doesn't know and attacks him.  Noah is forced to kill the man, the first time he ever killed anyone and this brings him to the attention of the Company who recruits him.  In order to curb his more violent tendencies towards specials, they have him marry Sandra who is a waitress at a restaurant where he and Thompson eat together.  Though Claire is horrified by the origin of her parents marriage, Noah assures her he really did love Sandra despite their arranged marriage and her opinion of Noah doesn't change for the worse, so Samuel locks them in a trailer together and buries them underground in order to force Claire to witness his death while she survives due to her powers.

In &quot;[[Brave New World (Heroes)|Brave New World]],&quot; after being rescued from near-death by Tracy Strauss, Noah, Claire and Lauren travel to the Carnival to stop Samuel's plan to kill thousands of people.  While Claire tries to convince the carnies of the truth, Noah tries to find Samuel, but is caught by Edgar.  Once he clarifies that he is there to stop Samuel and not to hurt anyone else, Edgar, who also wants to stop Samuel, teams up with him to do so.  The two arrive in time to back up Claire's allegations that Samuel killed Joseph and was responsible for the death of Lydia and what he plans to do.  When a brainwashed Eli backs them up, the carnies believe them and abandon Samuel who starts his earthquake while Noah and Claire try to get everyone to safety. Thanks to Peter battling Samuel, Noah and Claire have enough time to locate Hiro and Ando and have them teleport all of the carnies away.  Noah stays behind to finish the job and arrives after Peter defeats the powerless Samuel who collapses in despair at everyone's abandonment of him.  Noah has him arrested and covers up the incident with the help of Lauren until Claire climbs the Ferris Wheel to expose her powers to the world which he tells Lauren is breaking his heart.  Noah watches as Claire jumps off the Ferris Wheel in front of all the news cameras.

=== Heroes Reborn ===
Bennet is a central character in the 2015-16 miniseries ''[[Heroes Reborn (miniseries)|Heroes Reborn]]'', first seen in the web series Dark Matters, living as a car salesman four years after Claire's public reveal. He is tracked down by Quentin Frady, who has been researching Primatech and Renautas following the Odessa disaster and his sister's abduction.

It is revealed that Bennet was present in Odessa on June 13th when the Evo Summit was bombed. Noah was there to meet Claire, whom he believes to have died in the attack. Since then, he has been living under the identity of Ted Barnes and has attempted to move on with his life. Once confronted by Quentin, he begins to question what really happened at the summit and resumes his old identity to investigate. He follows a clue to an ophthalmology clinic in Dallas run by the Haitian. The Haitian returns to Noah his trademark glasses just before attempting to kill him. The two struggle before Bennet shoots him, killing him.

Bennet then decides to team up with Quentin to discover the truth behind the summit. The two travel to Primatech to recover Noah's old files in hopes of reuniting with Molly Walker.

After rescuing [[Hiro Nakamura]] in &quot;Game Over&quot;, Noah has Hiro take him back to the Evo Summit to save Claire and stop the bombing. After watching his past self be taken away by Erica Kravid, Noah is found by [[Angela Petrelli]] who informs him that Claire has been rushed to the hospital and is in surgery. While Hiro attempts to stop the bomb, Noah rushes to the hospital with Angela only to learn that Claire has died giving birth to twins. Noah says a tearful goodbye to Claire who doesn't revive for some reason. Hiro appears to him afterwards and informs him that he can't stop the bomb, there are too many variables and any attempt to stop it results in a worse future. As Hiro and Noah prepare to return to their own time, Phoebe Frady unleashes a massive wave of darkness that drains Hiro's powers shortly before Harris bombs the summit. Returning to Claire's children, Angela informs Noah that the Earth's magnetic poles will soon reverse and [[solar flare]]s will wipe out all life on Earth. Erica Kravid only intends to save those she wants and Angela has foreseen that one or both of Claire's children hold the key to saving the world. Noah realizes he had his memory wiped to protect Claire's children from Erica Kravid and decides that the safest place for them is in the past where they can grow up and prepare for their destiny. When they reach the correct time, Erica will be looking for toddlers, not teenagers. Hiro reluctantly agrees to take Angela back to 1999 to fulfill Noah's request while Noah intends to erase all security footage of the babies. Before Hiro and Angela leave, Noah and Angela name the babies as Claire never got to: Angela names Claire's son Nathan after [[Nathan Petrelli]] while Noah names Claire's daughter Malina after his own mother. After Angela, Hiro and the children are gone, Noah realizes that Erica is in the hospital and goes after her to kill her. His past self, having escaped with the help of Caspar Abraham, spots Noah and chases him down.

In &quot;11:53 to Odessa&quot;, Noah tries to get Malina to Odessa to stop the [[Extinction event|H.E.L.E.]] but during a massive storm, a car is flung right at him. Noah suddenly disappears leaving behind only his broken glasses.

In &quot;Project Reborn&quot;, Tommy learns that in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to sacrifice themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. &quot;a thousand times&quot;, he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy to take him to the present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy takes his hand. With the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah sitting on the ground, near death. Noah looks at his grandchildren one last time and tells them that he's proud of them before dying.

== Alternate futures ==
* In the alternate future of &quot;[[Five Years Gone]]&quot;, Noah Bennet (who is not wearing his trademark horn-rimmed glasses) works together with [[Hana Gitelman]] to protect people with superpowers from being persecuted by a now fearful government. It is revealed that he is trying to keep Claire hidden from the registry. Though he is estranged from Claire, he visits her at the diner to warn her to get away. When he arrives back at work, he discovers Hana has been killed, and Matt Parkman, now head of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], and his men are waiting for him. He does not realize Parkman has murdered Hana and broken their agreement, and hands Parkman a picture drawn by his son. Parkman holds a gun to him and demands to know where Claire is. Bennet refuses to answer, so Parkman reads Bennet's mind to extract Claire's location. Parkman then shoots Bennet in the head.
* In the alternate future of &quot;[[I Am Become Death]]&quot;, as depicted in the graphic novel &quot;[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 3|Resistance]]&quot;, Claire notes that she has lost both of her parents.

== Name ==
[[Image:Horn-rimmed and browline glasses.JPG|thumb|right|Mr. Bennet actually wears [[browline glasses]] (left), as opposed to [[horn-rimmed glasses]] (right).]]

Noah Bennet is initially introduced as &quot;the man in the horn-rimmed glasses,&quot; based on his distinctive eyewear. The glasses Coleman wears in most scenes are actually [[browline glasses|browline]], not horn-rimmed, but none of the characters seem aware of the distinction.  In the third episode, &quot;[[One Giant Leap]]&quot;, his name was confirmed as &quot;Mr. Bennet&quot; and he has been occasionally referred to as such since. Still, &quot;Horn-Rimmed Glasses&quot; (or a variant of it) is the more often used name by the characters, albeit indirectly. For example, characters who don't know him personally usually describe him as &quot;the man with horn-rimmed glasses.&quot; With regard to Bennet's [[given name]], Coleman has admitted that it was intentionally avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Caylo| first=Mel| title=TV Q&amp;A: Heroes - Jack Coleman| work=interview |publisher=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |date=2007-01-13| url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/heroes/003044177.cfm |accessdate=2007-01-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070115135007/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/heroes/003044177.cfm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evident in &quot;[[Distractions (Heroes)|Distractions]]&quot;, where Mrs. Bennet remarks that she is amused that everybody called him &quot;Mister&quot;, and almost states his first name before being interrupted.  His driver's license, displayed by Sylar in the same episode, did not show a first name.  According to Coleman, the character's first name was written out of a draft script because &quot;it stopped the scene cold.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TorontoSun&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Bill | title = Cooking with glasses | publisher = Toronto Sun | date = 2007-02-21| url = http://torontosun.com/Entertainment/Columnists/Harris_Bill/2007/02/21/3650395.html | accessdate = 2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final episode of season one, &quot;[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]]&quot;, Mr. Bennet tells Peter Petrelli to call him &quot;Noah.&quot;

Ironically, likely in a nod to the character's inaccurate name, Bennet tries on an actual pair of horn-rimmed glasses in a flashback sequence at the end of &quot;Company Man&quot;.  He decides not to wear them when Claire describes them as &quot;grandpa glasses.&quot;  Claire subsequently selects the browline glasses (declaring that he now looks &quot;like my dad&quot;), which he then wears from that point forward.

In an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'', Jack Coleman was asked &quot;were the horn-rimmed glasses your idea, or the writers?&quot; Coleman responded:
{{cquote|That was always in the script. Tim's original description in the pilot was &quot;an everyman but unknowable.&quot; The idea was based on [[Max von Sydow]]['s role] in ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', that seemingly benign but anything-but-benign character. I tried on many, many pairs of glasses to find the right look. The thing that's great about them is that they're so anachronistic, they kind of make him into this '50s Cold War warrior, which is perfect because he is this mystery guy who doesn't quite fit in. Putting those glasses on does half the work. They make you instantly suspicious [Laughs], because nobody wears glasses like that anymore.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuide&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Rudolph | first = Ileane | title = Jack Coleman, ''Heroes'': What's Going On Behind the Glasses? | publisher = TV Guide | date = 2006-11-26 | url = http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting=%7B301DC1FF-48F6-4260-8270-86D9F52B2E0A%7D | accessdate = 2007-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sasha Bezmel''' is a fictional character from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Demi Harman]]. The actress relocated to Sydney from Brisbane for filming and she stated that winning the role was a dream come true. Harman told a reporter that her character forced changes within herself, which she had difficulty adjusting to. Harman made her first screen appearance as Sasha during the episode broadcast on 31 August 2011. Harman decided to leave the show in 2014 and filmed her final scenes in October. Sasha made her official departure on 1 April 2015.

Sasha was introduced as established character [[Sid Walker]]'s ([[Robert Mammone]]) illegitimate daughter. Upon her mother's death, Sasha and her half-brother [[Felix Bezmel]] (Max Felice) were orphaned and Sasha had to move to [[Summer Bay]]. Sasha was initially &quot;a rebellious and furious teenager&quot;. Harman described Sasha as being &quot;sassy&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;, as well as having a stubborn streak. Shortly after her arrival, Sasha embarked on a relationship with [[Stu Henderson]] ([[Brenton Thwaites]]), which eventually turned abusive. Harman admitted that she was both scared and excited about taking on a domestic violence storyline. In February 2012, a [[whodunnit]] was formed when Stu was found dead. The Walker family soon became suspects and Sasha was bullied by a group of students led by [[Christy Clarke]] ([[Isabelle Cornish]]). Sasha soon confessed to killing Stu in self-defence when her father became the prime suspect.

While on the rebound from Stu, Sasha began dating [[Xavier Austin]] ([[David Jones-Roberts]]). However, the age difference and timing soon caused them to break up and Sasha quickly developed feelings for [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]). Sasha lost her virginity to Casey and also went through a pregnancy scare. After splitting from Casey, Sasha began dating [[Spencer Harrington]] ([[Andrew Morley]]). They initially kept the relationship a secret, so they did not hurt Spencer's ex-girlfriend and Sasha's close friend, [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]). In the same year, Sasha befriended [[Rosie Prichard]] (Teri Haddy), who became obsessive with Sasha's company and almost caused them both to drown during a stunt to get Sasha's attention. The character of Sasha has been positively received by critics and Harman was nominated for the Most Popular New Female Talent [[Logie Award]] in 2012.

==Casting==
[[Isabelle Cornish]] auditioned for the role of Sasha, however, it was actress Demi Harman who was eventually cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornish&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvweek.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=984625&amp;showcomments=true|title=Isabelle Cornish joins Home and Away|date=24 February 2012|work=[[TV Week]]|publisher=([[Ninemsn]])|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman had not long been attending university and relocated from Brisbane to Sydney for filming.&lt;ref name=thewestau/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/news/article/-/10137353/demi-harman/|title=Demi Harman|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network Seven]])|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving the role was Harman's &quot;dream come true&quot; and she fell in love with her character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harman&quot;/&gt; While being interviewed by Holly Richards from ''[[The West Australian]]'', Harman disclosed to her that the role forced changes in her and adjusting to them was &quot;hell difficult&quot;.&lt;ref name=thewestau/&gt; Harman made her debut screen appearance as Sasha during the episode first broadcast on 31 August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/synopses/article/-/10175635/episodes-5371-5375/|title=Episodes 5371-5375|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network Seven]])|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
Sasha is the illegitimate daughter of [[Sid Walker]] ([[Robert Mammone]]) and Regina Bezmel. On the serial's official website, Sasha is described as originally coming from &quot;just another working class family&quot; who were &quot;battling along&quot;.&lt;ref name=sashaa&gt;{{cite web|title=Sasha Bezmel|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/characters/article/-/10137523/sasha-bezDemiHarmanmel/|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network Seven]])|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the death of her mother leaves Sasha and her half-brother [[Felix Bezmel]] (Max Felice) orphaned. Sid meets Sasha a number of months after her mother's death because there is delay in the contact process. With &quot;months of grieving, misery and building resentment&quot; - Sasha becomes &quot;a rebellious [and] furious teenager&quot;.&lt;ref name=sashaa/&gt; She was also billed as &quot;uncontrollable, naughty and independent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sashaa&quot;/&gt; Harman said that liked her character's had a stubborn streak and that face that she is &quot;sassy&quot; and &quot;angry&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harman&quot;/&gt; Sid was initially &quot;just a means to an end&quot; to Sasha because he played no part in her life. She was soon introduced to her older siblings [[Dexter Walker|Dexter]] ([[Charles Cottier]]) and [[Indigo Walker]] ([[Samara Weaving]]).&lt;ref name=sashaa/&gt; Harman enjoyed working with her on-screen family and even came to think of Weaving as being her second sister.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; Sasha develops three romantic relationships during her first year in the series. Harman has stated that Sasha uses relationships as a method to convey that she is mature and grown up despite being sixteen.&lt;ref name=thewestau/&gt;

===Domestic violence===
{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote=&quot;We've tackled abuse storylines in the past but we haven't done it with such a young character before. [...] It is really a case of presenting it and leaving it open for discussion. Our research tells us Home and Away is watched a lot by mums and teenagers. (That means) we can present an issue like this (domestic violence) at 7 o'clock at night. Families can watch it and then discuss it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vickery|first=Colin|title=Domestic violence hitting Home|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/domestic-violence-hitting-home/story-e6frfmyi-1226189852987|work=[[News.com.au]]|publisher=([[News Corp Australia|News Limited]])|accessdate=7 August 2013|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; |source=—Producer [[Cameron Welsh]] on the storyline (2011)}}The serial used Sasha's relationship with [[Stu Henderson]] ([[Brenton Thwaites]]) to depict the issue of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; The actress told Erin Miller from ''[[TV Week]]'' that Sasha is &quot;absolutely smitten&quot; with Stu, despite Dexter's concerns. Sasha just begins dating Stu without carrying out any &quot;groundwork&quot; into who he is. There were no &quot;warning signs&quot; for her and it happened so rapidly that Sasha just &quot;kind of fell into&quot; the relationship.&lt;ref name=startof/&gt; Harman added that he is &quot;very protective&quot; over Sasha, and went on to explain that he is jealous and does not want her to interact with other males. [[List of Home and Away characters (2011)#Lachie|Lachie]] (Gig Clarke) begins text messaging Sasha and Stu becomes angry, the actress stated that Stu &quot;tries to take Sasha's phone and he questions why she would be texting another guy&quot; and subsequently hits her.&lt;ref name=startof/&gt; Sasha decides to get advice from [[Ruby Buckton]] ([[Rebecca Breeds]]), but does not tell her the full story. But Sasha decides to end their relationship.

Stu then steals [[Xavier Austin|Xavier Austin's]] ([[David Jones-Roberts]]) car and forces Sasha to get into it. He threatens that he shall do something &quot;extreme&quot; if she does not forgive him.&lt;ref name=startof/&gt; Harman said that &quot;he is out of control and Sasha feels like she has no choice but to get in the car even, though she is scared.&quot; Stu's anger issues are revealed to her at a &quot;very fast rate&quot; but there are &quot;elements of ignorance&quot; because she is not willing to accept the predicament.&lt;ref name=startof/&gt; Harman opined that it could be &quot;dangerous&quot; for her character if she becomes embroiled in a cycle of forgiveness. One of the reasons she puts up with Stu is because she is not fully over the death of her mother. She concluded that it was a &quot;disaster waiting to happen&quot;.&lt;ref name=startof&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|title=When love turns sour...|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=29 October – 4 November 2011|issue=44|pages=7|accessdate=5 June 2012|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline later came to the centre of the serial. Harman told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that she was both scared and excited about taking on Sasha's domestic abuse storyline.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; The actress has anti-violence values and it was &quot;really challenging&quot; for her to portray - but she was grateful for the opportunity to play the victim. Harman researched the issue by visiting a range of anti-abuse blogs and websites such as White Ribbon and The Line.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; She also learned about the &quot;psychology behind it&quot;. Harman explained that the story was &quot;necessary&quot; for Sasha's development and it subsequently scored positive feedback from the audience. There was also praise given to ''Home and Away'' for choosing to portray abuse within a teenage relationship. In various scenes the violence that Sasha endures from Stu becomes &quot;quite heavy&quot;. Harman stated that she and Thwaites knew it was a &quot;serious&quot; issue and made an effort not to take both their character's state of minds home with them.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt;

Sasha is convinced that Stu will change and forgives him. Harman explained that &quot;I think she reminds herself that as much as Stu hurts her, she genuinely loves him enough to want to help him stop doing what he's doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; Sasha actually sees Stu's &quot;true colours&quot; from the first time he hurts her - but she does not do anything about it. She just carries on letting it happen until it begins happening in public. Harman felt that Sasha's denial was the most &quot;frustrating part&quot; of the scenario. She hoped that anyone in a similar situation to Sasha would seek help and tell someone.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt; When her father, Sid learns the truth he attacks Stu in &quot;intense&quot; scenes. The actress revealed that some characters understand that Sid is trying to protect his daughter. But she added that &quot;it does bring to light in the Summer Bay community the issue of trying to solve violence with violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=dsint&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Home and Away' Demi Harman chats Sasha, Stu violence plot: Interview|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/interviews/a363256/home-and-away-demi-harman-chats-sasha-stu-violence-plot-interview.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=3 June 2012|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman later revealed that the storyline had been her favourite so far because it was &quot;epic&quot;.&lt;ref name=pjs/&gt; Discussing her character's future with a writer from [[Yahoo!7]], she said that &quot;a lot of people&quot; wanted Sasha to grow up and Stu's behaviour would &quot;greatly impact her in the future&quot;.

Her aim is to destroy her. She tries to get rid of her friends, bully her and make her uncomfortable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornish&quot;/&gt; The actress added that she had to make herself believe Sasha was a bad person and that she wanted her to feel unhappy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornish&quot;/&gt; Harman explained that she found it easy to relate to Sasha's bullying storyline, as she herself was bullied at school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullied&quot;/&gt; The actress said that Sasha does not cope with well with the bullying and it is &quot;definitely a test of her strength and stability.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bullied&quot;/&gt;

===Relationships===

====Xavier Austin====
In January 2012, a writer for ''TV Week'' observed that with sparks already flying between Sasha and Xavier, it looked like they would become ''Home and Away's'' newest couple over the coming months.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=21–27 January 2012|title=Summer Bay secrets|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=3|page=5|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones-Roberts agreed and stated that when Sasha first came to the Bay she and Xavier clashed nonstop. Xavier likes the &quot;fiery&quot; aspect of the girls he dates and tries to match them.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS&quot;/&gt; Following Sid's arrest for Stu's murder, Sasha is taunted by some Summer Bay High students in the Diner and Xavier sticks up for her because he feels it is the right thing to do.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS&quot;/&gt; Through this, Sasha and Xavier develop a friendship. The ''TV Week'' writer added &quot;But because Sasha is quite strong-willed, this budding romance could take a while to develop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS&quot;/&gt; Sasha also initially rejects him because she feels too &quot;toxic&quot; to begin a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Home and Away' relationship twists - Spoiler Pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/scoop/a366230/home-and-away-relationship-twists-spoiler-pictures.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=7 August 2013|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasha and Xavier's relationship eventually comes to an end. Harman told ''The West Australian's'' Richards that Sasha quickly got together with Xavier while on the rebound from Stu. She believed that Sasha loves him, but the age difference and Xavier not being ready cause the break up. Harman concluded that Sasha is left feeling bitter over Xavier and directly develops feelings for [[Casey Braxton]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]).&lt;ref name=thewestau&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Holly|title=Soap star rebel|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/-/entertainment/14052809/soap-star-rebel/|work=[[The West Australian]]|publisher=([[Seven West Media]])|accessdate=3 February 2013|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress also told Susan Hill from the Daily Star that Sasha were more &quot;big storylines&quot; lined up for Sasha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Susan|title=Home and Away: Demi Harman warns stars not to play tongue tennis|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/lifestyle/games/239925/Home-and-Away-Demi-Harman-warns-stars-not-to-play-tongue-tennis|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=6 August 2013|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Casey Braxton====
[[File:Lincoln Younes (8019695382).jpg|thumb|left|140px|Lincoln Younes plays Sasha's third love interest, [[Casey Braxton]].]]
Harman told ''TV Week's'' Miller that she was shocked that her character would be interested in another River Boy, after what happened with Stu.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|date=9–15 June 2012|title=Love Sparks|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=23|page=6|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress thought Casey was the good one out of the group, so that appealed to Sasha.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt; Harman commented &quot;I think she's had a bit of a bad run with Stu and then with Xavier not pulling his weight for her. But she's very keen on Casey because he's always been there and she hasn't really noticed him until now, so she becomes a bit curious.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt; Harman called the situation &quot;the butterfly period&quot; and explained that when Sasha is around Casey, she gets butterflies and then she wants more butterflies.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt; Sasha and Casey become closer when she helps him with his feelings towards his incarcerated father, [[Danny Braxton|Danny]] (Andy McPhee).&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt; Sasha supports and encourages Casey, proving to be a loyal friend. Through this she slowly falls in love with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt; Harman added that things between Sasha and Casey would not be smooth, saying &quot;I think the upcoming stuff is all about Danny and Casey's issues, and he doesn't always treat Sasha the best way. She gets thrown around a little bit before she sees any good signs of him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LoveSparks&quot;/&gt;

Sasha later loses her virginity to Casey, shortly after he is released from prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginity&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/279467/Home-and-Away-Sasha-Bezmel-loses-her-virginity-and-gets-pregnant/|title=Home And Away: Sasha Bezmel loses her virginity and gets pregnant|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=28 October 2012|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then believes that she may be pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginity&quot;/&gt; Harman said that she was shocked when she learned that a pregnancy storyline may be on the way for her character.&lt;ref name=&quot;BabyStoryline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a432381/home-and-away-actress-surprised-by-baby-storyline.html|title='Home and Away' actress surprised by baby storyline|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=22 October 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented &quot;I was reading the storyline and I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was extremely sad about the pregnancy. It's a terrible thing to happen to a 16-year-old. It would be so shocking. I wouldn't have known what to do [at that age]. I probably still wouldn't know what to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BabyStoryline&quot;/&gt; Sasha &quot;feels unable&quot; to talk to Casey, believing that he does not feel as strongly about her as she does him. Harman explained that the situation is awkward for Sasha because their night together meant more to her, plus Casey is in &quot;a really bad headspace&quot; with his upcoming court case.&lt;ref name=&quot;BabyStoryline&quot;/&gt; Sasha decides to confide in [[Natalie Davison]] ([[Catherine Mack]]), the school counsellor, because she trusts her.&lt;ref name=&quot;BabyStoryline&quot;/&gt;

====Spencer Harrington====
Following his break up with [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]), [[Spencer Harrington]] ([[Andrew Morley]]) becomes attracted to Sasha and she feels the same way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/home-and-away/news/love-blossoms-for-sasha|title=Love blossoms for Sasha|date=3 June 2013|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not long before Dex and Indi notice it too. When Dex realises how much chemistry Sasha and Spencer share, he encourages Spencer to act on his feelings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;/&gt; Indi become aware of the situation when Sasha recommends Spencer for a job at her gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;/&gt; Harman explained that Sasha's siblings want things to happen for Sasha, especially since she has had her fair share of heartbreak and &quot;bad times with boys&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;/&gt; Dex and Indi believe Spencer is eligible and they try everything to make him and Sasha admit their feelings for each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;/&gt; When Spencer gets the gym job, he celebrates with Sasha and they start to realise that they are becoming something more than friends. However, they are hesitant to act on it, as they do not want to hurt Maddy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blossoms&quot;/&gt;

Sasha initially rejects Spencer's advances, but she eventually confesses her feelings for him. Spencer is suspicious at first, but realises that she is being genuine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a488690/home-and-away-spencer-sasha-feel-guilty-over-romance.html|title='Home and Away': Spencer, Sasha &quot;feel guilty&quot; over romance|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 June 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morley explained that Sasha does not want to jump in and get hurt like before, but Spencer realises that she is a sweet girl and that they are both unsure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilty&quot;/&gt; When Sasha goes to walk away from Spencer, he kisses her. Morley quipped &quot;It's a cute little scene, because they're both really honest with each other and go with their instincts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilty&quot;/&gt; The begin dating, but decide to keep the relationship to themselves at first, as they are worried about breaking the news to Maddy. Both Sasha and Spencer feel guilty and struggle to find the right time to tell her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guilty&quot;/&gt;

===Friendship with Rosie Prichard===
[[File:Teri Haddy 2013.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Teri Haddy played Sasha's friend Rosie.]]
In January 2013, a new friend for Sasha arrived in the form of &quot;sweet, but awkward&quot; [[Rosie Prichard]] (Teri Haddy).&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshfaces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=19–25 January 2013|title=Fresh faces|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=3|pages=6–7|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddy revealed that Harman made her feel right at home on set and gave her a bug hug on her first day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshfaces&quot;/&gt; Rosie had always lived in Summer Bay, but was never been seen on-screen before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshfaces&quot;/&gt; Haddy called Rosie a bit of &quot;a loner&quot; and said that she looks up to Sasha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshfaces&quot;/&gt; After Rosie becomes friends with Sasha, she is invited to a party at her house. Haddy explained that when Rosie learns that Sasha used to date Casey, she gets excited because, to her, he is like royalty in the Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshfaces&quot;/&gt;

Harman explained that Rosie would become &quot;a bit obsessive about Sasha's company&quot; and in trying prove that their friendship is genuine, she runs into the rough surf to get Sasha's attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/home-and-away/news/deep-trouble-for-sasha-and-rosie|title=Deep trouble for Sasha and Rosie|date=25 February 2013|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosie feels Sasha has not been taking enough notice of her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heads&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Gavin|date=2–8 March 2013|title=In over their heads|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|issue=9|page=13|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosie cannot swim and soon finds herself in trouble. Harman said that there is &quot;huge danger&quot; for the both of them, as the beach is not being patrolled and Sasha is not a confident swimmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep&quot;/&gt; Sasha eventually becomes concerned for Rosie and she is forced to confront her fears and enter the surf to rescue her. However, both girls soon end up in danger when they become stuck in a [[rip tide|rip]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep&quot;/&gt; While filming the scenes, Harman and Haddy got stuck in a rip for real. Harman ended up getting dragged out further than Haddy and she called the experience scary, but felt safe as there were lifesavers on the beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heads&quot;/&gt;

When Rosie was raped by fellow student [[Alexander Mullens]] (Louis McIntosh), she immediately turned to Sasha for help and support.&lt;ref name=&quot;FriendInNeed&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=4 10 May 2013|title=A friend in need|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|issue=18|page=30|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasha proves to be &quot;a tower of strength&quot; for Rosie in the aftermath of her ordeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;FriendInNeed&quot;/&gt; Both girls are shocked when Mullens turns up at school and brags about being let go by the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;FriendInNeed&quot;/&gt; Seeing how much it is hurting Rosie, Sasha lashes out and punches Mullens in the face. Sasha finds herself in trouble and worries that Mullens might report her to the police for assault.&lt;ref name=&quot;FriendInNeed&quot;/&gt;

===Departure===
On 2 November 2014, it was confirmed that Harman had left ''Home and Away'' after three and a half years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domjen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/summer-bays-demi-harman-heads-from-home-away-to-hollywood/story-fni0cvc9-1227109492853|title=Summer Bay’s Demi Harman heads from Home &amp; Away to Hollywood|last=Domjen|first=Briana|date=2 November 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She filmed her final scenes on 10 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domjen&quot;/&gt; Of leaving, Harman commented, &quot;Leading up to finishing was so traumatic, it was so scary. Letting go of something you have known and loved for three-and-a-half years was traumatic.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domjen&quot;/&gt; Sasha made her screen departure in mid-2015 and Harman hinted that her exit storyline would contain &quot;tears, tears and more tears&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domjen&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
Following her mother's death, Sasha arrives in Summer Bay to live with her long-lost father Sid. He initially appears uncaring as he is forced to work shifts at the hospital. Sasha decides to seek employment with the aim of supporting herself and her half-brother Felix. [[Leah Patterson-Baker]] ([[Ada Nicodemou]]) offers Sasha a job at the Pier Diner. Felix runs away from his home and finds Sasha. When [[The Great Storm (Home and Away)|a storm]] passes through Summer Bay the pair take refuge in [[John Palmer (Home and Away)|John Palmer]]'s ([[Shane Withington]]) house. Sasha finds John has collapsed and she calls Sid, who sends an ambulance. Felix hides in the local school, while Sasha steals money from the Diner till. [[Roo Stewart]] ([[Georgie Parker]]) convinces Sasha to hand over the money and gives her a second chance. Sid asks Felix's father to let Felix move in with his family, but Felix's father refuses. Sasha begins dating Stu Henderson and Sid voices his disapproval, but later relents when he realises that Sasha will not stop seeing Stu.

Sasha is delighted when Stu tells her he loves her. Stu later becomes angry when she does not reply to his texts. Sasha tries to explain herself, but Stu slaps her. He buys her a ring and apologises to convince her to stay with him. Sasha gets a tattoo for Stu, but he is unimpressed and slaps her in the face. She forgives him, but Stu slaps her again when she talks to another guy. Sasha attempts to give the ring back to Stu who becomes angry and steals Xavier's car. He insists that Sasha accompany him on a drive and successfully begs for another chance. Sasha's tattoo becomes infected and Xavier takes her to the hospital to be treated. Sasha tries to avoid Stu, but he begins to harass her via the telephone. While attending a Year 12 formal, Stu hassles Sasha and hits her once again. This time Sid witnesses the attack and he beats Stu up. Sasha reveals the truth about the abusive relationship and Stu's father, Alan, confronts Sasha about her accusations. Stu is later found dead and the Walker family become suspects. Sasha also becomes the victim of a bullying campaign.

When Sid is named as the prime suspect, Sasha confesses to killing Stu in self-defence and the police are informed. However, they view it as a murder and press charges. She is later found innocent. Sasha has a brief romance with Xavier before turning her advances to Casey. She supports him through his many problems and they become good friends. As she spends more time with him she develops feelings for him and she loses her virginity to him. Sasha then has a pregnancy scare. When [[Tamara Kingsley]] (Kelly Paterniti) arrives in the Bay, Sasha finds herself competing for Casey's affections. He chooses Tamara, which leaves Sasha upset. Sasha befriends Rosie Prichard, but she soon becomes possessive. Rosie tries to gain Sasha's attention by running into the surf. While trying to help Rosie, Sasha nearly drowns in the process.

'''Elle Bishop''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] who appeared on the American [[psychological thriller]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] series ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator [[Tim Kring]] and portrayed by actress [[Kristen Bell]]. Elle was created by Kring to act as a contrast to the rest of the characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the [[Heroes (season 2)|second season]] and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into [[Heroes (season 3)|season three]].

Elle is introduced in the episode &quot;[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]&quot; as an agent of the [[Company (Heroes)|Company]], an organization whose primary purpose is to identify, monitor and study those individuals with special abilities. The daughter of Company head [[List of Heroes characters#Bob Bishop|Bob Bishop]], she possesses the power to generate and manipulate electricity. Elle is portrayed as mentally unstable, which is attributed to extensive &quot;testing&quot; condoned by her father to research her abilities when she was young. During the third season, Elle's powers grow out of control but with [[Sylar]]'s help she regains control of them and begins a relationship with him. After finding out that Elle played a role in his transformation into a &quot;monster&quot;, he kills her while they're at a beach.

Critical reception towards both the character and Bell's performance has been positive. Praise was directed towards Elle's personality, characterization and abilities, with her death in the third season being criticized. Bell was nominated for both a [[Saturn Award]] and a [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]] for her performance.

==Development==
===Concept and creation===
In 2007, following the cancellation of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', actress [[Kristen Bell]] had voiced interest in appearing on ''Heroes'' because she was a fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;&gt;{{cite interview| subject= Kristen Bell| subject2= Tim Kring| interviewer= Renee Burl| title= Tim Kring &amp; Kristen Bell interview| publisher= thescifiworld.net| date= 2007-10-26| url= http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/tim_kring_kristen_bell_01.htm| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, during a train ride back from the [[San Diego Comic Con]] with ''Heroes'' actors [[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Masi Oka]], and writers from the series, the writers had mentioned that if Bell &quot;ever want[ed] to come on ''Heroes'', give us [writers] a call&quot;, to which Bell said she would love to.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV guide&quot;&gt;{{cite interview| subject= Kristen Bell| interviewer= Michael Ausiello| title= Exclusive: Kristen Bell's First Interview Since Becoming a Hero!| publisher= tvguide.com| date= 2007-08-20| url= http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Exclusive-Kristen-Bell/800020731| accessdate= 2007-11-25|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112184315/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Exclusive-Kristen-Bell/800020731 |archivedate = November 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced in August 2007, Bell was to portray Elle, a &quot;mysterious young lady&quot; with an &quot;awesome power&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TV guide&quot;/&gt; for a total of thirteen episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last= Adalian| first= Josef| title= Kristen Bell throws curve to 'Heroes'| publisher= variety.com| date= 2007-08-19| url= http://variety.com/2007/scene/markets-festivals/kristen-bell-throws-curve-to-heroes-1117970491/| accessdate= 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heroes'' creator [[Tim Kring]] and the writers had created the character of Elle with the idea that she was a &quot;cautionary tale&quot; of what could happen if the other characters had known of their abilities for the duration of their lives as Elle did.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; Kring pitched Bell the idea for the character &quot;which she loved&quot; and soon they were &quot;off and running.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Errico |first=Marcus |title=Veronica Mars Sleuths Out Heroes Gig |publisher=[[E!]] |date=2007-08-20 |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=eab9bfea-befb-4e0c-bf2c-984d1617be72 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220052954/http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=eab9bfea-befb-4e0c-bf2c-984d1617be72 |archivedate=February 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting of Bell, as Kring explains, &quot;was not easy to pull off,&quot; but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, &quot;we found a way to jump into a small window in [Bell’s] schedule.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;/&gt; Originally, Elle was only meant to be Bob's stepdaughter and [[List_of_Heroes_characters#Meredith_Gordon|Meredith Gordon]]'s daughter, making her [[Claire Bennet]]'s sister, however this idea was dropped due to &quot;lack of storyline and plot holes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volume 2: what changed. Volume 3: what's next.|url=http://www.heroesrevealed.com/spoiler/volume-2-what-changed-volume-3-whats-next/|website=Heroes Revealed|accessdate=19 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116210101/http://www.heroesrevealed.com/spoiler/volume-2-what-changed-volume-3-whats-next/|archive-date=2008-01-16|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Elle was created long before Bell was cast; however, Kring noted &quot;when you do cast an actor ... you try to tailor that character a little closer to who the actor is. So it's hard to know when one starts to influence the other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt;

===Characterization===
When Kristen Bell was cast, she noted that with Elle it would be &quot;unclear whether she's good or bad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV guide&quot;/&gt; In &quot;[[Four Months Ago...]]&quot;, Elle admits to being diagnosed as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] and previous to that, she had displayed [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] behavior as a result of testing done to her as a child. Bell explains, &quot;Bodies are not able to take that much electricity and pain, and so Elle's psychologically a little off her rocker.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H&amp;K&quot;&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Kristen Bell |subject2=Hayden Panettiere |interviewer=Michael Logan |title=Preview: Heroes' Blonde Babes Have an Unconventional Meet-and-Greet |publisher=tvguide.com |date=2007-11-19 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/heroes-hayden-kristen/071119-01 |accessdate=2007-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725035634/http://www.tvguide.com:80/News/heroes-hayden-kristen/071119-01 |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is able to kill without apparent [[remorse]], although in one instance, she reacts defensively when Mohinder asks her how many have died by her hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cautionary&quot;/&gt;

During an interview with ''thescifiworld.net'', Tim Kring described Elle as &quot;a little off&quot;, and Bell added that Elle is &quot;a little messed up in the head&quot; and a highly conflicted individual who does not have the ability to decipher between right and wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; Because of that, Bell explains that Elle comes off as more of a victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; Bell also explains that Elle is one of the few characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on the verge of being addicted to her ability. Elle &quot;enjoys the emotional power it gives her over other people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; She is described as one who is &quot;always out to get what she wants&quot; and someone who &quot;doesn’t have many boundaries&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; Bell describes Elle as a [[vixen]] who &quot;feels like she has a romantic connection to everybody&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;wizard&quot;&gt;{{cite interview

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a few episodes, Elle is shown displaying a great deal of affection to men and flirting with both Peter Petrelli and Mohinder Suresh.

Bell noted the similarities between Elle and the character Claire Bennet, saying that they &quot;relate to each other&quot; and &quot;are two sides of the same coin&quot; because, while Elle's father sanctioned testing on her, supposedly causing her mental instability, Noah kept Claire hidden, preventing Claire from experiencing the same childhood that &quot;really messed [Elle] up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buddy&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= Heroes: Kristen Bell and Hayden Panettiere Talk About Their Characters| publisher= buddytv.com| date= 2007-11-22| url= http://www.buddytv.com/articles/heroes/heroes-kristen-bell-and-hayden-14063.aspx| accessdate= 2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell has said in interviews that in later episodes of ''Heroes'', &quot;You'll find out that Elle holds the key to Claire's future&quot; and that Elle has &quot;a [present] with Peter and a past with Claire's dad and a future with Claire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buddy&quot;/&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Elle has the ability to generate and manipulate [[electricity]], discharging and directing it as [[Electric arc|electrical arcs]]. She has been shown being able to [[Welding|weld]] a lock, blast objects, knock people unconscious, and even kill a man. She is not entirely immune to the electricity she produces, however, as shown when she is drenched in water and attempts to create electricity — she gives herself an [[electric shock]], causing great pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;First&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer= Kim, Chuck| penciller= Odagawa, Ryan| inker= Starr, John | story= ''Heroes'' | title=[[List of Heroes graphic novels (season 2)|Elle's First Assignment (Part 1)]] | volume=1 | issue=63 | date=December 12, 2007 | publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cautionary&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Cautionary Tales| episodelink = Cautionary Tales (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (TV series)| credits = Director: [[Greg Yaitanes]], Writer: Joe Pokaski | network = NBC | airdate = 2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elle has endured a series of testing by the Company during her childhood that measured the extent of her power. Bob had stated that Elle was in a &quot;different league&quot; when comparing her to Claire.&lt;ref name=&quot;First&quot;/&gt; When inquiring about her abilities, Elle was able to learn from Noah Bennet that the Company had wanted to record the extent of her abilities (whether she could power a flashlight, a street lamp, or an entire city block) and Bob had often prompted to continue the tests further, even after Elle had passed out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cautionary&quot;/&gt;

Her ability is shown to respond to her emotions. After Bob's death, mourning Elle loses control over her ability and her body starts to produce electricity at any time (''[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 3|Sum Quod Sum]] graphic novels'') ; this makes Elle unable to stay close to electrical devices such as computers and even a plane. She claims to live in constant pain (''[[Eris Quod Sum]]''). This ends when Sylar helps her forgive herself (''[[It's Coming]]'').

==Appearances==
===''Heroes''===
====Generations====
Elle's first chronological appearance is in &quot;[[Four Months Ago...]]&quot;. During this time, the Company made [[Peter Petrelli]] their willing prisoner and in those months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that he likes the little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she has lived in the Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in [[Ohio]]. She also says that she spent her ninth birthday in a glass room with an [[intravenous therapy|IV]] of [[lithium]] in her arm. She also explains that she has never been on a date and has never been swimming. When he escapes from the facility, Elle is upset and angry to the point that she blasts Peter, setting him ablaze during his escape. She then chases after [[Adam Monroe]] while [[the Haitian]] goes after Peter.

Elle first appears in the episode &quot;[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]&quot; searching for Peter in [[Ireland]]. Peter has no recollection of his past and is staying with the owner of Wandering Rocks Pub, [[List of characters in Heroes#Ricky|Ricky]]. Elle questions Rick about Peter's whereabouts and when he pretends not to know Peter, she kills him with a large bolt of electricity on her way out the door. Later on, during a telephone conversation with [[Bob Bishop (Heroes)|Bob Bishop]], her father and Company head, she dismisses the murder as trivial and insists she can find Peter. However, she is pulled off the assignment, much to her frustration.

In &quot;[[Cautionary Tales (Heroes)|Cautionary Tales]]&quot;, Elle comes back to the United States. Former Company employee [[Noah Bennet]] captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, [[Claire Bennet|Claire]]. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare feet together and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests [[Haitian (Heroes)|the Haitian]] had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and [[List of Heroes characters#West Rosen|West]] as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, [[Mohinder Suresh]], a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.

In the episode &quot;[[Truth &amp; Consequences]]&quot;, Bob chastises Elle for allowing West and Claire to escape. He then assigns Elle to perform surveillance on Claire and her family as they prepare to leave town. Claire, however, spots Elle from a distance, leading to a physical confrontation, which leads Claire to threaten to expose the Company

Elle's last appearance in season two is in &quot;[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]&quot;. Her father reprimands her for her mistakes; to redeem herself, she attempts to re-capture the now powerless [[Sylar]] for the Company. She uses her ability to confront Sylar in Mohinder's research lab, but Sylar is armed with a gun and shoots at Elle. Sylar manages to slip away, leaving Elle unharmed. She comes out somewhat defeated, but is informed by Mohinder that if not for her arrival, Sylar would have killed him, [[Maya Herrera]] and [[Molly Walker]]. He says the three of them owe her their lives, to which she replies, &quot;Cool&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powerless&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Powerless| episodelink = Powerless (Heroes)| series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (TV series)| credits = Director: [[Allan Arkush]], Writer: [[Jeph Loeb]]| network = NBC | airdate = 2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode marked Bell's previously expressed interest in performing in scenes with the character Sylar, as she and [[Zachary Quinto]] had been good friends for almost ten years. Bell had said that she &quot;would love to see him and Elle face off one day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt; In November 2007, Bell and Quinto filmed scenes at a restaurant in [[Los Angeles]], which was set as a &quot;[[New Jersey]] Diner&quot; and had involved police and paramedics. The filmed scenes are part of the untold stories which are a special feature of the season 2 DVD set.

====Villains====
Returning in the episode, &quot;[[The Butterfly Effect (Heroes)|The Butterfly Effect]]&quot;, following her failure to stop [[Sylar]], Elle seeks assistance from Noah Bennet. He is detained in Level 5, a high security ward for the Company's most dangerous prisoners. However, Sylar is already there, having killed her father. He attempts to take her ability, but the pain of being scalped causes her to involuntarily release a massive electrical surge. This knocks Sylar out, but also disables security for the entire facility, allowing the [[The Company (Heroes)#Primatech Research|prisoners]] to escape. Elle is later fired by [[Angela Petrelli]], the new head of the Company, who tells Elle that the only reason the Company kept her was because of her father's influence.

In the episode &quot;[[Eris Quod Sum]]&quot;, Elle makes her way to Claire's house to seek help from Noah, having lost control of her ability. She attacks Claire out of anger, but is subdued when Lyle throws water on her. She is told that an organization called Pinehearst could help her with her condition, so Claire agrees to escort her there. They reach Pinehearst just in time to see Peter Petrelli thrown from a seventh story window. Claire takes him away from the building, but Elle refuses to leave after learning from Peter that they can take her powers away.

In the episode &quot;[[Villains (Heroes)|Villains]]&quot;, Elle's life a year earlier is explored, revealing that she had been partnered with Noah Bennet at one point. The two are assigned to watch Sylar (still Gabriel Gray) in order to discover how he transfers abilities. Elle saves Gabriel after he attempts to kill himself out of guilt for killing his first victim. She is told to befriend him, and Gabriel develops an attraction to her that suppresses his hunger. Using a list of people with abilities Gabriel had compiled, Noah arranges to introduce Gabriel to one of them to see his power in action. However, Elle does not agree with the plan, revealing she has developed feelings for Gabriel. She reluctantly goes along with it when Noah threatens to fire her.They then introduce Gabriel to Trevor, an evolved human with a kinetic projection ability. Her repeated references to Trevor being &quot;special&quot; anger Gabriel, and he orders her to leave while he kills Trevor. Elle is left with guilt as she caused an event that helped to create &quot;Sylar&quot;.

In the following episode, &quot;[[It's Coming]]&quot;, set in the present, [[Arthur Petrelli]], head of Pinehearst, arranges for Sylar to speak with Elle. His aim is to have Sylar use his latent empathic abilities to take powers, rather than doing so through killing. Elle is chained to the floor in a metal room, still in pain from her ability. She repeatedly attacks him, furious at Sylar for her father's murder, eventually begging him to kill her so that her pain will go away. He forgives her for turning him into a monster and convinces her to forgive herself for her crimes, wanting to take away her pain without killing her. At that moment, Elle's pain disappears and she regains control of her ability. Likewise, Sylar is able to absorb her power. The two appear to rekindle their old feelings for each other as Elle teaches Sylar how to use her ability.

In &quot;[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse Part I]]&quot;, she and Sylar are sent to retrieve Claire who is revealed to be the catalyst, the unknown part of the formula that would allow someone to produce abilities. On assignment, Elle challenges Sylar and he shows her that he can still be a killer, and not just a &quot;daddy's boy&quot; by killing a rental car assistant. Eventually, they find Claire and Noah, and a fight ensues, however, Elle and Sylar find themselves powerless; the result of the eclipse. Elle aims a gun at Noah but Claire jumps in and takes the bullet. Noah knocks Elle out and dislocates Sylar's arm, while he escapes with injured Claire. After awakening, Sylar explains to a shocked Elle that losing his abilities is a bit of a relief. She tells him that they can't just take what they want anymore, then Sylar retorts and grabs Elle, kissing her passionately. Outside, Noah aims a rifle at them.

In &quot;[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse Part II]]&quot;, Sylar and Elle sleep together but then are confronted by Noah. Elle is shot in the thigh in the ensuing struggle. Both Elle and Sylar flee while Noah follows Elle's blood trail to a grocery store. There, Elle and Sylar plan to ambush Noah in the rear of the store. Sylar pushes Elle into a cargo elevator, in an attempt to hide her from Noah. Elle watches as Noah slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When the eclipse ends, their abilities are returned and Sylar is revived. He and Elle go to the Bennet residence and overcome Noah and Claire while holding Claire's mother, Sandra, hostage. Suddenly, Hiro teleports in and takes both Sylar and Elle to Costa Verde beach, leaving them there before disappearing. Sylar and Elle kiss, and he explains that he and Elle are &quot;damaged goods&quot; and that they will &quot;never change&quot;. Sylar then begins to slice Elle's skull open.

In the following episode &quot;[[Our Father (Heroes)|Our Father]]&quot;, Sylar, covered in Elle's blood, is shown pouring lighter fluid on Elle's body. He painfully says, &quot;Goodbye Elle,&quot; then sets her ablaze with the electric ability he inherited from her.

====Redemption====
In the episode &quot;[[Tabula Rasa (Heroes)|Tabula Rasa]]&quot;, Elle is seen in flashbacks as Sylar witnesses his real memories reflecting in the ''Hall of Mirrors''.

In &quot;[[The Art of Deception (Heroes)|The Art of Deception]]&quot;, Matt reverts Sylar's memories of his kills, including the ones of Elle.

She is also referred in &quot;[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 2|Faces, Part 1]]&quot; to have helped Thompson Jr. and [[List of characters in Heroes#Penny Logan|Penny Logan]] taking down The Croatian.

In &quot;[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 3|Sum Quod Sum]]&quot;, it is revealed that she has lost control of her ability since leaving the Company, so she has gone to [[London]] to find help from [[List of characters in Heroes#Claude Rains|Claude]]. After she tracks him down, he confronts her but then runs away. It begins raining, and Elle decides to take advantage of it. She releases an electrical charge, which travels through the water on the ground and into Claude, but she, too, is knocked unconscious in the process. Claude and his friends, [[List of characters in Heroes#Abigail|Abigail]] and Lee, carry her to his place and he begins to show Elle the source of her problem. Things get ugly when Elle accidentally shocks Abigail, which leads them to fight each other; Abigail's force field redirects Elle's lightning towards Lee, so Elle stops and then is asked to leave the place. Although Claude asks her to stay, she prefers to look for the help of Noah, so she goes to Costa Verde and attacks Lyle while waiting for his father.

In &quot;[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 4|From the Files of Primatech: 1991]]&quot;, the childhood's background of Elle is further explained: how she started a blackout in [[Athens, Ohio]] that took out three other counties. Elle's mother sent her to his father, [[List of characters in Heroes#Bob Bishop|Bob]], to [[New York City]] to deal with her. Bob asked the help of [[List of characters in Heroes#Charles Deveaux|Charles Deveaux]], who recommended taking a fatherly approach, but ended up taking [[List of characters in Heroes#Dr. Jonas Zimmerman|Dr. Zimmerman]]'s advice: treat Elle as any other posthuman and test her abilities. During one of these tests, Bob tried to calm the weeping Elle turning her drinking straw into gold, but this backfired as it allowed Elle to accidentally shock her father. After this, Elle escaped and Bob enlisted [[Noah Bennet]] to go after her. Noah eventually found Elle at an arcade and anticipating her attack, he wore latex gloves. Elle quickly electrified a machine making it toss balls at Noah, so she could escape. When Noah followed Elle through a mini-golf course, she electrified a mini-windmill, making it throw blades at Noah. Finally, Elle was cornered; Noah promised her Bob would be proud if she came back with him. Once back at Primatech, Bob locked Elle up while discussing the situation with [[List of characters in Heroes#Kaito Nakamura|Kaito]] and Noah. [[Angela Petrelli|Angela]] brought a young [[Haitian (Heroes)|Haitian]] to mind-wipe Elle to forget what just happened and enjoy her 9th birthday cake.

== Reception ==
Bell's performance was highly anticipated as she had gained popularly within her starring show, ''[[Veronica Mars]]''.  Ultimately, Bell's performance was critically praised, along with the character of Elle, who became very popular among viewers. Elle was ranked #44 on [[IGN]]'s &quot;Top 50 Chicks Behaving Badly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Amanda|title=Top 50 Chicks Behaving Badly: Round 1|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/31/top-50-chicks-behaving-badly-round-1?page=7|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cancellation of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''Variety'' reported that attaining Bell was a &quot;major, major coup for NBC&quot; because of how in-demand the actress was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;/&gt;  [[Universal Media Studios]]' Katherine Pope noted that &quot;many studios [were] chasing [Bell] in both film and TV&quot; and that Pope was happy that Bell &quot;chose to star in our show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;/&gt; When Bell was cast, Tim Kring explained that because she had known several of the cast members for years as well as some of the writers, it &quot;was already like part of the family by the time we cast her.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scifi&quot;/&gt;

In an interview with Bell, Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] commented on Bell's &quot;eagerly awaited debut&quot; on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Goldman| first= Eric| title= Heroes: Kristen Bell Talks| publisher= [[IGN]]| date= 2007-10-19| url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/19/heroes-kristen-bell-talks| accessdate= 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported on Bell becoming a series regular on ''Heroes'', and stated he &quot;like[s] her more and more, especially as we see the tragic dimension of how Elle has been so cruelly used by her 'daddy,' Bob, and is much more than the flirty assassin we first met.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roush |first=Matt |title=Ask Matt |publisher=[[TV Guide]] |date=2007-12-03 |url=http://www.tvguide.com/ask-matt/heroes/071203-02 |accessdate=2008-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721021917/http://www.tvguide.com/roush/heroes-24810.aspx |archive-date= July 21, 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Fretts, also of ''TV Guide'', said that Bell's portrayal of Elle was responsible for &quot;sparking ''Heroes'' to life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saved&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last= Fretts| first= Bruce| title= Heroes Saved by the Bell| publisher= [[TV Guide]]| date= 2007-10-23| url= http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Cheers-38-Jeers/Cheers-Heroes-Saved/800025359| accessdate= 2008-03-08|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509104318/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Cheers-38-Jeers/Cheers-Heroes-Saved/800025359 |archivedate = May 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that &quot;[i]n just a few scenes... [Bell is able to] juice up the slumping sophomore drama&quot; and her &quot;live-wire performance turned Chapter 5 into this season's strongest episode yet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saved&quot;/&gt; However, because of the large ensemble cast, Matthew Gilbert of ''Slate.com'' commented that Season Two of ''Heroes'' was &quot;even more overpopulated than the last, expanding from a rabble to a veritable global riot of Dubiously Gifted Ones.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Gilbert| first= Matthew| title= Too Many Heroes| publisher= Slate.com| date= 2007-09-21| url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/tv_week/2007/09/too_many_heroes.html| accessdate= 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Swan is a German [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] raised in the [[Bavaria]]n circus and highly trained in hand-to-hand, swordplay and gunmanship. He utilized his ability to infect the minds of others with disruptive &quot;[[telepathic]] [[virus]]es&quot; to become a successful mercenary and hit man, which brought him into conflict with the [[Taskmaster]]. He carried out an assassination on the four heads of the Japanese Four Winds crime families and organisation in New York, but although he carried it out surreptitiously, the credit was given to rival contractor Deadpool, who crashed through a skylight above the Four Winds at the same time, while firing wildly and in fact unknowingly missed the targets. When Deadpool was subsequently hired to kill Black Swan in Germany, the assassin beat Deadpool senseless, infected his mind with a mental &quot;virus&quot;, and brought him to the U.S., having him brutally beaten every few minutes to prevent him from fully healing.

Swan attempted to use his operative, [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Nijo]], a brother of one of the Four Winds, to torment Deadpool further, saying that letting Deadpool live with diminished capacity would be a greater humiliation than killing him. Once Taskmaster identified the Swan to Deadpool, the merc with a mouth traveled to the Swan's castle in Germany for a final showdown. When Nijo tried to kill Deadpool, claiming a personal vendetta against him, Black Swan impaled him with a [[Swordstick|sword-cane]] and fought Deadpool both physically and mentally, though he lost and was thrown face first into the white hot griddle of his own fireplace. A bomb Deadpool had brought as insurance went off before Deadpool could disarm it, destroying Black Swan's castle.

Apparently Black Swan was able to use his powers to in some way absorb traits from both Deadpool and Nijo in order to survive, resulting in the three of them sharing aspects of each other's powers, knowledge and personalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ag X14&quot;&gt;''Agent X'' # 14&lt;/ref&gt; The modified Nijo would become [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]], while Black Swan was rescued by a Portuguese fishing boat, and Deadpool was rendered temporarily [[amnesia]]c. The three were reunited, along with Taskmaster and Sandi Brandenburg,&lt;ref&gt;''Agent X'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; and Black Swan demanded the return of his personality and abilities, for which he required Agent X's help, proposing a three-way mindmeld to restore each man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ag X14&quot;/&gt;

Black Swan, however, double-crossed the others and absorbed both their powers, enhancing his own abilities to a tremendous level. Agent X, having anticipated treachery, had called upon a small army of heavily armed mercenaries to surround the area, but they proved no match for Black Swan's newly augmented telepathy and were quickly incapacitated. Together with the mercenary called [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]], Deadpool, Agent X, and Taskmaster were able to overwhelm Black Swan's healing ability and kill him. To be on the safe side, they had his body stuffed by a [[taxidermy|taxidermist]] so that he could not regenerate.

Recently, he was revealed to still be alive and whole again (possibly due to Deadpool's healing factor) and was hired by the mutant [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] (who like Black Swan, had just been revealed to still be alive, after long being thought killed) to kill a now-depowered Deadpool (who like Black Swan, had been similarly restored to a normal appearance).&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol 3, #57&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Deadpool chose to spare Black Swan's life by taking him to a hospital after defeating him with life-threatening injuries, Black Swan repaid the favor and saved Deadpool from being killed by the ex-mutant [[Black Tom (comics)|Black Tom]], who had been hired by Black Box as they both had grudges against Deadpool.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol 3, #58&lt;/ref&gt; Black Swan then used his powers to make Black Box and Black Tom forget Deadpool had ever lost his healing factor, so they would stop trying to come after him again.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol 3, #59&lt;/ref&gt; Black Swan even proposed to team up with Deadpool, who was forced to grudgingly accept as he needed allies in his current condition.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol 3, #60&lt;/ref&gt;

Yabbat Ummon Tarru was a princess on Earth-1365 and became its lone survivor. When she was four years old, her earth was involved in an incursion event, where two universes are colliding with each other at the focal point of their Earths. A race of beings called Black Priests came from the parallel Earth, intent on destroying her Earth to save their own universe and killing anyone who stood in their way. She fled into the Library of Worlds, a way station of the multiverse. There she was met by three Black Swans (female beings each of a different appearance) who took her in and raised her to be a Black Swan.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Avengers #5&quot;&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

This new Black Swan came to Earth-616 when it experienced its first incursion event. She was intent on destroying Earth in order to save both universes involved in the incursion. [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] tries to stop her but fails when she successfully triggers an anti-matter injection device, but she then destroys the Earth she came from instead of Earth-616. She is then captured by Black Panther and imprisoned below Necropolis, The City of the Dead in [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mister Fantastic]] is chosen to interrogate the Black Swan. While she seems cold and ruthless, she is seen via security camera weeping and crying out for help when sleeping. Though she is straightforward with her answers, they seem cryptic and like superstitious nonsense. She constantly warns that worse things are coming, and they need to prepare, but no matter what they do it's only delaying the inevitable because in the end everything dies. It was also revealed that Black Swan has a hatred toward [[Doctor Strange]] and magic users in general, being unwilling to tolerate Doctor Strange even talking to her, once he had told her he is a master of the mystic arts and the Sorcerer Supreme. This may be because her original Earth was destroyed by the Black Priests who appear to be magic users wearing helmets with one large eye on them, resembling the Eye of Agamotto.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Avengers #5&quot;/&gt;

After the Illuminati try to deal with the next two incursions that occur on their own, they succeed only through luck, and seek help from the Black Swan, who shows she had the strength to break out of her jail cell all along. She is willing to help them for a price, which is her own life, and in helping them, she helps herself for the moment. She gives them her history and the only method of permanently stopping incursions into their universe to destroy their Earth. As a sign of her good faith, she also gives them the scientific knowledge to make a device to forecast upcoming incursions, where as up until then, their technology could only detect incursions as they occur; her own such devices are implanted in her eyes. The Illuminati also reverse-engineer her anti-matter injection bomb, which they use to stop the next incursion. Black Swan is later placed in a cell where she has the [[Terrax]] of Earth-13054 as a cellmate. Both of them form an alliance where they will use each others talents for the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #6&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Thanos finds the Illuminati's base. While looking for the [[Infinity Gems]], Thanos stumbles upon the cell of Black Swan and Terrax of Earth-13054. When both of them ask for Thanos to free them in exchange for being one of his lieutenants, Thanos declined and left.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #11&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defeat of both Thanos and the Builders, Black Swan told the Illuminati that the threat of the Builders was nothing compared to the other forces that are out there.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #12&lt;/ref&gt; Black Swan then instructed the Illuminati to build the Bridge which revealed to the Illuminati the past actions of Black Swan on other Earths. Upon the Illuminati re-imprisoning Black Swan, Terrax of Earth-13054 later pointed to Thanos' cell where Black Swan sees that [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] member Corvus Glaive is slowly reviving.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #15&lt;/ref&gt;

After Namor was kicked out of the Illuminati, he released Thanos, Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, Black Swan, and Terrax of Earth-13054 in order to form his incarnation of the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]]. They made plans to do what the Illuminati didn't want to do and that was destroy the worlds that were in the incursions.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #23&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Time Runs Out]]'' storyline, Black Swan was with the Cabal claimed the ruins at Wakanda as their base and started destroying worlds that would be a threat to Earth-616 during the incursions. Black Swan started to know about Namor's wavering dedication and event taunted him.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #24&lt;/ref&gt; Black Swan informed the rest of the Cabal of an unusual event. As they were unable to return to Earth-616 upon being left on the unidentified Earth, the Cabal headed to Earth-1610&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #41&lt;/ref&gt; When Black Swan became aware of Namor's treachery, she confronted Namor who stated that survival is the only thing he cares about now. Black Swan decides not to tell the rest of the Cabal about Namor's secret.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #43&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Black Swan and the rest of the Cabal worked with [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Marvel|Maker]] into making a life-raft that would save them from the final incursion involving Earth-616 and Earth-1610 where it was deployed during the fight between both it's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final incursion, Black Swan and the Cabal awoke in their life-raft when it landed on the patchwork planet called [[Battleworld]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; While Black Swan and the Cabal were fighting the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Corps, Sheriff Strange released the survivors of Earth-616 from their life-raft in hopes that they would confront the Cabal.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being teleported to Doomgard by Sheriff Strange, Black Swan was confronted by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] and ended up serving him.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Black Swan was with God Emperor Doom's family when it came to the battle between Battleworld's inhabitants and God Emperor Doom's forces. When Black Swan confronted Star-Lord near the World Tree and defeated him, she was caught by surprise when [[Star-Lord]] managed to turn the World Tree into [[Groot]] who defeated her.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanos later recruited Black Swan and Proxima Midnight to join his second incarnation of the Black Order. He then dispatched them to [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]'s ship to obtain the Mjolnir of Earth-1610. Black Swan, Proxima Midnight, and the unidentified cloaked ally of Thanos snuck onto Collector's ship where they had an encounter with Thor Odinson and [[Beta Ray Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;''Unworthy Thor'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; After Beta Ray Bill had been knocked out by Thor Odinson who was suffering from warrior madness, Black Swan and Proxima Midnight tried to target Stormbreaker only for the cloaked figure to tell them that Stormbreaker is not their target. The three of them continued to search Collector's ship where they find the City of Asgard which is where the Mjolnir of Earth-1610 is located. When Black Swan and Proxima Midnight attacked Collector, they were struck by an energy blast emitted from the Mjolnir of Earth-1610.&lt;ref&gt;''Unworthy Thor'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The first Black Swan has the ability to implant a telepathic virus in the minds of others which disrupts the natural functions of their brains to cut off access to and override motor coordination, disorient their concentration, etc.

The second Black Swan is very knowledgeable about the incursions and the multiverse, and has the ability to speak in multiple languages, including some of Earth's oldest languages, knowledge she has gleaned traveling between alternate Earths. She has access to advanced technology including anti-matter devices and ocular implants that forecast upcoming incursions and allow her to see incursion walls (which are invisible to the naked eye until something passes through them). She has displayed multiple powers including energy beams from her eyes, flight, super strength, the ability to generate holographic visuals from her hands, and also telepathy which she has kept hidden from the Illuminati and uses to secretly converse with her fellow prisoner Terrax. The full extent of her abilities and powers remain undefined and their source unknown.

'''&quot;Black Tom&quot; Cassidy''' ('''Thomas Samuel Eamon Cassidy''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]], and [[archenemy]] of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]. In addition to fighting the X-Men, he has clashed with [[Deadpool]] a number of times.

Black Tom is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can manipulate, bond with, and project energy through [[plant]] life. He was the [[black sheep]] of a prominent [[Ireland|Irish]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;mnyc&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6  | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  X-Men member [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] is his [[cousin]]. Tom secretly raised Banshee’s daughter [[Siryn]], of whose existence Banshee was unaware, and conscripted her into his criminal gang. Black Tom was also a longtime criminal partner of the super-strong villain [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], until Juggernaut's reformation.

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=July 2016}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], Black Tom Cassidy first fully appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #101 (October 1976).

==Fictional character biography==
===Family===
[[Image:Tomseanmaeve.png|210px|A young Tom and Sean Cassidy meet Maeve Rourke. Art by [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]].|thumb|left]]
Black Tom was born in [[Dublin]]. He is the cousin of Sean Cassidy, the [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], a member of the [[X-Men]]. He was also once the only friend of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].

His original principal power was that he could generate blasts of heat through a [[wood]]en medium, such as the [[Shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]] that he often carries. He has a rivalry with Sean, mainly because Sean won both Cassidy Keep, their estate, and the family fortune from Tom in a game of dice. They were also rivals for a woman named Maeve Rourke, whom Sean married.

While Sean was away, working for [[INTERPOL]], Maeve gave birth to their daughter, Theresa. Not much later, Maeve died in an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombing. With no means to contact Sean, Tom took care of Theresa.

When Sean returned to learn of his wife’s death, he was devastated. Before Tom could even tell him of the existence of his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve.

While Sean flew away in anger, Tom fell into a chasm, breaking his leg as a result of the attack, which left him with a limp. Angrily, Tom swore to make Sean pay and vowed to never tell him about his daughter, raising her himself instead.

===Supervillain===
Later Tom became a criminal and came into conflict with the law and was apprehended. While serving time in prison, Tom met and befriended [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. The two became close friends and allies, and worked together on missions. As part of his revenge scheme against Sean, Tom murdered a lawyer ally of Banshee.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #99&lt;/ref&gt; Black Tom and Juggernaut then took Banshee and the other X-Men prisoner at Cassidy Keep. He was defeated in a duel by Banshee.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #101-103&lt;/ref&gt; Black Tom and Juggernaut next hired [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] to kill the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #122&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside Juggernaut and Theresa (now under the codename [[Siryn]]), Tom went to [[San Francisco]] and stole the USA's entire [[vibranium]] supply. Several X-Men and the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] subsequently liberated the vibranium and captured Black Tom and Siryn. Convinced a life of crime was too dangerous for Theresa, Black Tom exonerated her of responsibility for the theft,&lt;ref name=&quot;SW&quot;&gt;''Spider-Woman'' #37-38&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a letter to Sean explaining who she was.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #148&lt;/ref&gt; Juggernaut broke him out of prison the same day.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Woman'' #38&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom next sent the Juggernaut to abduct [[Madame Web]], observing Juggernaut's battle with [[Spider-Man]] from afar.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #229-230&lt;/ref&gt; Black Tom was briefly endowed with half the powers of Juggernaut by the Ruby of [[Cyttorak]]. He then teamed with Juggernaut against Spider-Man and the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #150&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Tom next took [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] hostage on behalf of Arianna Jankos. He used an interdimensional teleporter to return the Juggernaut to Earth. He then battled Siryn and her teammates in [[X-Force]]. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] shot Tom, and [[Deadpool]] took Tom to [[Genesis (comics)|Mr. Tolliver]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformation===
After being shot by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Tom was taken to [[France]], where doctors grafted a wood-like substance onto his wounds, healing him and allowing him to channel his bio-blasts directly through his fists. Unfortunately, due to a genetic virus the substance spread over Tom's body, and only the mutated cells of the mercenary [[Deadpool]] (due to his [[healing factor]]) were able to help Tom stop the spread of the plant growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;DPV2I3&quot;&gt;''Deadpool, Volume 2'', #3 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original plan was to capture Deadpool and copy his cells, one of Black Tom's minions managed to sever Deadpool's hand. Its attachment to the stump of Tom's intentionally severed hand was enough to save him.&lt;ref name=&quot;DPV2I3&quot; /&gt;

The effect of Deadpool's cells did not last for long. The spreading began again, to the point where Tom was completely composed of plant matter. As a result, his powers included control and manipulation of all manner of plant life, to the point where he could make plant doppelgangers of himself, or anyone else. He was completely insane as a result.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

During this time, Black Tom resurfaced as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].{{issue|date=May 2012}} Earlier, [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] had infiltrated the X-Men for him as part of the Brotherhood's plan, though Juggernaut slowly changed during his time with the X-Men, mostly due to the positive influence of the young boy [[Sammy Paré]]. Juggernaut rejoined the Brotherhood, secretly planning on turning them when the time was right. Sammy stumbled upon the group, and assuming that Juggernaut was betraying the X-Men, started lashing out. In retaliation Tom brutally murdered the boy, causing Juggernaut to attack Cassidy, dismembering him. Due to Tom's new plantlike physiology, this did not hurt him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' 163 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Juggernaut managed to escape and warn the X-Men, while Black Tom led an attack on the X-Mansion. Besides killing the school's cook, their mission was a failure. In the end [[Xorn]] sucked Black Tom and the rest of the Brotherhood into a [[black hole]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' 164 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===M-Day===
After [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Black Tom woke up as a human again, losing his secondary mutation but possibly still retaining his old powers, along with his sanity. The organization [[Black Air]] hired Tom to attack the new incarnation of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], of which Juggernaut was now a member. Though he easily defeated the others, Juggernaut confronted his former friend and convinced him to turn himself in for the death of Sammy, saying &quot;He was a kid, Tom. An' you an' me, for all our faults, we used ta be better than that.&quot;

Tom also showed remorse for killing the child, &quot;That wasn't me, Cain, you know that. I wasn't in my right mind... You've got to understand... that mad life, before... it was like some dream.&quot;

===''Deadpool''===
Black Tom reappears in ''[[Deadpool]]'', where he was hired by [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] to hunt Deadpool.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' #58 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men: Blue===
Black Tom resurfaces with the Juggernaut attacking a luxury yacht, but they are confronted by the time-displaced [[All-New X-Men|young X-Men]], with Jean knocking Black Tom out while Beast - who has been training in magic - creates a dimensional portal that passes through Hell before sending Juggernaut to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Blue'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Black Tom was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose principal power was the ability to generate and discharge [[concussive]] blasts of force and heat through any wooden medium. He typically carried a [[Shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]], a traditional [[Ireland|Irish]] wooden fighting stick, which he used as a focus for his power. He was immune to [[Banshee (comics)#Powers and abilities|Banshee's sonic powers]], as the two cousins' powers cancel each other out on contact.

Black Tom is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and skilled with bladed weapons:  he has carried a sword and battle-axe on occasion. He is also a master of terrorist strategies and tactics.

Black Tom very briefly possessed the powers of the Juggernaut at half their full might.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #150&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, his [[physiology]] and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] were radically changed, and he became a humanoid plant form capable of living in several different bodies and infecting foliage and trees to make them a part of his body.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #410&lt;/ref&gt; This made him difficult to restrain or destroy because it was nearly impossible to destroy every part of his body, as much of it could be kept underground, and because he could invade other plants with his life force to add them to his own body. While in this form, he was also able to [[siphon]] off the life energy of living beings by sending specialized tendrils into their [[body cavity|body cavities]]. However, the process seemed to have affected his mind, and he was not in full control of himself.{{issue|date=March 2016}}

After M-Day, in which most mutants lost their powers, he lost his [[secondary mutation|alterations]] and his human form was restored,&lt;ref&gt;''New Excalibur'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; though he has since demonstrated both his bio-blast and plant control powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool'' vol 2 #59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===X-Men Noir===
&quot;Blackie&quot; Cassidy is depicted as an Irish drug dealer with ties to the Brotherhood, a secret society of corrupt police officers and detectives.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Noir'' #1. December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
Cassidy is referenced to be a contact of Ultimate [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] in [[Ultimate X-Men]] and is said to be an Irish arms dealer.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #53&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* Black Tom appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]''. He teamed up with Juggernaut to kidnap [[Lilandra Neramani]] in the cartoon version of the Phoenix Saga. He and Sean are referred to as brothers in the series continuity with Sean being the elder. He also has a cameo appearance in the following episode running from the Cassidy Castle, presumably out of sheer awe and fright at the exhibition of Gladiator's powers.

===Internet===
* Footage of Black Tom's appearance in the cartoon was used in the [[List of internet phenomena|internet meme]] ''[[The Juggernaut Bitch!!]]''.

'''Black Widow''' ('''Claire Voyant''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. An antiheroine who kills evildoers in order to deliver their souls to Satan, her master, she first appears in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #4 ([[cover date]]d Aug. 1940), published by Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. Created by writer [[George Kapitan]] and artist [[Harry Sahle]], she is unrelated to Marvel's later [[spy fiction|superspy]] character called [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]].

==Publication history==
The Black Widow makes five appearances during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]], all five written by [[George Kapitan]]. These short comics stories (the longest is eight pages, the shortest five) are spread among three different Timely anthology titles over a three-year period from 1940 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/character/name/Black%20Widow%20%5BClaire%20Voyant%5D/sort/chrono/ The Black Widow] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madame Claire Voyant''' is introduced in ''Mystic Comics'' #4 as &quot;the strangest, most terrifying character in action picture magazines — the Black Widow. You've heard of the black widow spider — that evil creature whose bite spells doom. Now start the adventures of another black widow — a human tool of Satan whose very touch means death.&quot; Both ''Mystic Comics'' #4 and #5 (Aug. 1940, Mar. 1941) feature artwork by Harry Sahle (the stories are &quot;Introducing the Black Widow&quot;, 7 pages, and &quot;Garvey Lang&quot;, 8 pages, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/950/ ''Mystic Comics'' #4] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/1315/ ''Mystic Comics'' #5] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Mystic Comics'' appearance in issue #7 (Dec. 1941) has art by [[Stan Drake]] (&quot;Lewis &amp; Sykes&quot;, 5 pages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.comics.org/issue/1843/ ''Mystic Comics'' #7] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Comics]]'' #5 (Summer 1942) is penciled by [[Mike Sekowsky]] and inked by [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] (&quot;Murder Unlimited&quot;, 5 pages).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/2289/ ''USA Comics'' #5] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; Her final Golden Age appearance in ''All Select Comics'' #1 (Fall 1943) has art tentatively attributed to Drake (&quot;Blood Money&quot;, 5 pages);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/3186/ ''All-Select Comics'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; this story is reprinted in 1974, along with the rest of the issue, by publisher [[Alan L. Light]]'s company Flashback as ''Special Edition Reprints'' #14.

Her next appearance occurs 51 years later, in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] cameo in one panel of issue #1 (Jan. 1994) of the [[mini-series]] ''[[Marvels]]'' (&quot;A Time of Marvels&quot;, written by [[Kurt Busiek]] with art by [[Alex Ross]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;internationalhero&quot;&gt;[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/blackwidowga.htm, The Black Widow]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at International Hero.&lt;/ref&gt; and again nine years later (Feb. 2005), also in brief flashback, in [[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]] #9 (&quot;The Last Stand&quot;, written by [[Mark Millar]] with art by [[Terry Dodson|Terry]] and [[Rachel Dodson]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;internationalhero&quot; /&gt;

The Black Widow returns, finally in full-length stories, albeit as part of an ensemble cast, beginning in 2008 in ''[[The Twelve (comics)|The Twelve]]'' (written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] with art by [[Chris Weston]]). The character appeared in all 12 issues of ''The Twelve'', in addition to a one-shot titled ''The Twelve:  Spearhead.''

==Fictional character biography==
In 1940, Claire Voyant is a [[spirit medium]] who communicates with the dead through supernatural means. While serving a family named the Waglers, she is possessed by Satan to put a curse on them.  James, a member of that family, survives a subsequent car crash provoked by the spell and, upon returning to Claire's quarters, guns her down.

Voyant's soul goes to Hell, where Satan dresses her in her Black Widow costume. He also gives her the power to kill with a single touch of her fingers to the head (which leaves a branded &quot;Black Widow mark&quot;) and other mystical tricks. Satan (who, daringly for the time, is discreetly depicted as a nearly nude man) sends her back to Earth to avenge her death. After killing her murderer, she returns to Satan who, no longer content to wait for evil souls to die a natural death and perhaps repent their sins in the interim, charges her with bringing those souls to him. &quot;On the upper world are mortal creatures whose hearts are blackened with wickedness and corruption. You, the Black Widow, will bring their evil souls to me!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/widow.html |title=The Black Widow |first=Jess |last=Nevins |authorlink=Jess Nevins |work=A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters |archivedate=June 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613004534/http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/widow.html |deadurl=no }} Additional [http://www.webcitation.org/5s9XVUvJu?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reocities.com%2FAthens%2FOlympus%2F7160%2Fgaguide.html WebCitation archive], retrieved August 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

She later kills corrupt arms manufacturers, crime boss Garvey Lang, members of a syndicate called Murder Unlimited and the villain Ogor, while also healing Ogor's victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;internationalhero&quot; /&gt;

In ''Marvels'', she is shown in flashback as part of a group of Timely's Golden Age characters aiding the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] against the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvels'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern incarnation==
In ''The Twelve'', Claire Voyant is [[retcon]]ned as becoming the Black Widow in 1928 after her sister is murdered. Standing over her sister's grave, she wishes for the power to avenge herself against the killer, and Satan responds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twelve'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Revived in the present day, along with 11 other heroes, after being in [[suspended animation]] since [[World War II]], she recommences serving as an &quot;instrument of vengeance&quot; for an initially unidentified entity (though never actually referred to as Satan, the Black Widow's master is identified as &quot;the devil&quot; in later issues) and going on missions for that party.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twelve'' #1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
A recurrent character trait of the Black Widow in her Golden Age appearances is that she shows no hesitation or mercy when it comes to killing her victims, and no apparent remorse over depriving them of their lives and sending their souls to Hell for eternal torment. Whether this ruthless aspect of her personality is original to Claire Voyant or a result of her resurrection by Satan as the Black Widow is unclear. (In her modern day appearances in ''The Twelve'' she is much less a willing killer, and is shown crying after killing.)

In Golden Age appearances she does possess great compassion for those she perceives as innocent victims of evil, and a willingness to use her powers to protect and even heal them. This is shown most clearly in her fifth and last Golden Age appearance&lt;ref&gt;''All Select Comics'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; when she is sent by Satan to harvest the soul of Ogor, a charlatan faith healer who has been stealing money from those who come to him for cures. After confronting Ogor and causing his death – though he instantly dies of fright and heart failure rather than the Black Widow’s signature death touch, the result is the same, his blackened soul goes instantly to Hell – she then takes the time, and uses her powers, to regenerate the amputated leg of a young boy named Pepito, one of Ogor’s last victims he had promised to heal.&lt;ref name=&quot;marvunapp&quot;&gt;http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/blackwidowga.htm, The Black Widow page at the ''Appendix to The Handbook of the Marvel Universe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costume==
During her five brief appearances in the Golden Age, the Black Widow wears four distinctly different costumes, with different designs and different color schemes, and has three different hair colors.

Appearing only in ''Mystic Comics'' #4, her first costume consists of a purple bodysuit with spider design on the belly, a green-and-blue striped cape, and red boots with yellow flame designs around the tops.

For her second appearance in ''Mystic Comics'' #5, the red boots with yellow flame trim survive; however, the bodysuit becomes plain black with no spider design, and the color of her cape changes to solid red.

In ''Mystic Comics'' #7 the color scheme and basic layout of the costume remain the same; however, the bodysuit acquires dark blue highlights, and the red cape now has flame designs around its hem. Both the &quot;flames&quot; and the cape itself are the same shade of red. Though highly similar to the costume in ''Mystic Comics'' #5, it is different in its particulars. The cape is held in place with a circular, gold-colored pin inset with a death’s head skull. Her hair remains blond for all three ''Mystic Comics'' appearances.

In ''USA Comics'' #5, the costume changes radically. The outfit's colors are now red, white and blue. The costume itself consists of a bright red bodysuit, a cape (colored either white or blue depending on the panel in question) with upturned Peter Pan collar, and white buccaneer boots. Her hair is now pure white.

For her final Golden Age appearance, in ''All Select Comics'' #1, the costume morphs into a blue bodysuit that, unlike any of her previous outfits, covers her legs as well as torso and arms, and a yellow cape. The boots with flame trim return, however both the boots and &quot;flames&quot; are yellow. The Black Widow is now a redhead.

Throughout the majority of ''The Twelve'' she wears a fifth outfit, a minor redesign of the first, consisting of a dark purple bodysuit with, in a lighter shade of purple, a spider design on the belly. Her boots are the same dark purple as the bodysuit, with no &quot;flames&quot;; the cape is light purple, and likewise has no flame trim. In issue #12, the finale, she wears a sixth costume, which is gray, that covers her entire body except her head and hands, and features a fine spiderweb pattern over much of its surface.

==Historical significance==
Introduced in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #4 (Aug. 1940), the Black Widow is comic books' first costumed, superpowered female character. While writer-artist [[Fletcher Hanks]]' [[Fantomah]], who has the superhero tropes of a dual identity and superpowers, debuted earlier, in [[Fiction House]]'s ''[[Jungle Comics]]'' #1 (Feb. 1940), she lacks a distinctive costume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm Fantomah, Mystery Woman of the Jungle] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Erroneously credited here to a Hanks [[pseudonym]], &quot;Henry Fletcher&quot;. [http://www.webcitation.org/66moryli6?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/fantomah.htm Archived] from the original on April 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Woman in Red (comics)|The Woman In Red]] also predates her, debuting in [[Standard Comics]]' ''[[Thrilling Comics]]'' #2 (March 1940), that character has a distinctive costume but no superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/womanred.htm The Woman in Red] in Don Markstein's Toonopedia. [http://www.webcitation.org/66nSsQ8vY?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/womanred.htm Archived] from the original on April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Stamm's [[Invisible Scarlet O'Neil]], a non-costumed character with the superpower of invisibility, debuted in a [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]], rather than a comic book, on June 3, 1940.

==Powers and abilities==
Before her transformation into the Black Widow, Claire Voyant has undefined psychic powers enabling her to communicate with the spirits of the dead. Resurrected by Satan after her murder, the Black Widow has been granted supernatural powers allowing her to harvest the souls of evildoers for her master. She is able to teleport between Hell and the mortal world. Having already died, she is apparently immune to further attempts to kill her. In three separate Golden Age appearances, she is shot repeatedly and the bullets have no effect.&lt;ref&gt;''Mystic Comics'' #s 5 and 7, ''USA Comics'' #5.&lt;/ref&gt; She can mentally plant suggestions in the minds of others, possesses superhuman strength of an undefined nature, enhanced endurance, flight, invisibility, appearance alteration, and the ability to regenerate or heal others mystically.
 
She also has a death touch power. When the Black Widow touches one of her victims on the forehead, there is a burst of flame, they are instantly struck dead and their soul is sent to Hell. At the same time a mark is left in the shape of a spider.

In her modern appearances in ''The Twelve'', she exhibits the ability to fly and superhuman strength sufficient to rip human bodies to pieces. Apparently she still possesses her death touch power, however the only time she is shown attempting its use, it fails to work on a non-human target.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twelve'' #10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satan claims he has made her immortal.&lt;ref&gt;”Hah! Little do persons of evil know the plans I have for the immortal Black Widow!” –Satan, ''Mystic Comics'' #4.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of ''The Twelve'' when Claire Voyant becomes the Black Widow in 1928 she appears to be in her mid-20s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twelve'' #7.&lt;/ref&gt; When she goes into suspended animation, 17 years later, in 1945, she apparently has not aged at all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Twelve'' #1.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it seems that the Prince of Lies may have told the truth.

'''Grace Black''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Tamara Wall]]. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013. Wall had three auditions for the role on the show's set in [[Liverpool]]. The character is introduced as the sister of [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]), who had been killed-off in earlier episodes. Grace arrives to investigate her death and get reacquainted with her estranged father [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birdsall]]).

Grace's characterisation initially played her as a ruthless gangster. The character received an extensive character development from ''Hollyoaks{{'}}'' executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] and his team. He believed he had let Wall down with Grace's original characterisation. Focusing on the character's personality and style, he and Wall transformed her from a gangster who fought for &quot;bags of money&quot; to a more family oriented woman fighting for &quot;love and loyalty&quot;. Production also created a unique style for the character with long acrylic nails and black suits. They later gave Grace a big [[bouffant]] hair style, that became a trademark of the character and gave her a bigger personality. Her introductory storyline focused on her damaged relationship with Fraser. He was soon killed-off in a &quot;[[whodunit]]&quot; storyline, which placed Grace as a main suspect. Writers also created a long-term relationship for Grace alongside [[Trevor Royle]] ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) and their relationship was centric to the character's storyline for three years. Grace gained a best friend in [[Esther Bloom]] (Jazmine Franks) and writers used the friendship to transform Grace into a more likeable character with viewers.

The character has been involved in many of the show's stories of her time. She has portrayed numerous kidnappings, fights, feuds and stunts. She has feuded with [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]), [[Big Bob]] ([[Vincent Ebrahim]]), [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) and [[Freddie Roscoe]] ([[Charlie Clapham (actor)|Charlie Clapham]]). She has been pushed from a balcony, held hostage, shot, nearly killed Joe with a wrecking ball and has also been stalked by her lover [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]). Grace's plots have been both topical and dramatic – her relationship with Trevor and Esther explored the issue of surrogacy, while her affair with Kim culminated in a dramatic car crash stunt. In 2016, writers brought about the end of Grace's relationship with Trevor. They played him having an affair with [[Sienna Blake]] ([[Anna Passey]]) and later murdered by Sienna's daughter [[Nico Blake]] (Persephone Swales-Dawson) during his wedding to Grace. Producers then introduced Grace's extended family consisting of three half-brothers and her mother.

Wall has received four award nominations for her portrayal of Grace, including one &quot;Best Actress&quot; nomination at the 2016 [[Inside Soap Awards]]. The character has been generally well received by critics of the genre. Wall has received praise for her performances of grief and others branded the character &quot;ruthless&quot;.

==Casting==
Wall attended three auditions for the role. Her first was on the ''Hollyoaks'' set in [[Liverpool]], where she also acted out some scenes alongside regular cast members [[Jesse Birdsall]] and [[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]], who play [[Fraser Black]] and [[Trevor Royle]] respectively.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; On 24 October 2013, Wall's casting as Grace was made public. The actress had already begun filming with ''Hollyoaks'' and a promotional image was released of her in character.&lt;ref name=casting/&gt; Grace was given immediate links with other characters in the show. She arrives wanting to investigate the death of her sister [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]). It was also revealed she would share screen time with her father Fraser and his bodyguard Trevor. The character made her first on-screen appearance on 8 November 2013.&lt;ref name=casting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' unveils Clare Devine's sister Grace Black|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a525945/hollyoaks-unveils-clare-devines-sister-grace-black/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===

====Personality====
{{cquote|Grace Black is as strong as New Years Day coffee and she manages to turn heads wherever she goes. But don't be fooled – her smile is a mask and her perfectly manicured nails are claws in disguise (and are just as sharp)! Fierce, ruthless and dangerous – it's easy to see how Grace is the only gangster left standing in the Black family.|4=An excerpt from Grace's biography on the [[Channel 4]] website.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace Black (Tamara Wall)|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/hollyoaks/profiles/all/grace-black-tamara-wall/625|website=[[Channel 4]]|publisher=([[Channel Four Television Corporation]])|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grace has been compared to a [[chameleon]] in her official character biography. This is because of her complex personality and differing attitudes depending on the type of characters that are sharing scenes with her.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Grace behaves in an aggressive manner, has a ruthless mentality and can be a dangerous character to be around. For instance Grace's customers and acquaintances sometimes view her as &quot;bubbly and warm&quot;. Though her close family and friends are more accustomed to a &quot;cold, hard-nosed and uncompromising&quot; nature – but the character does process a &quot;true soft side&quot;.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 2013, Wall told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that Grace is &quot;pretty rock hard&quot; and her childhood left her damaged emotionally. Fraser paid more attention to Clare and left Grace to fend for herself.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks actress Tamara Wall: 'Grace Black role gets darker'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a535739/hollyoaks-actress-tamara-wall-grace-black-role-gets-darker/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wall explained that &quot;she was the strong one and quite tomboy-ish. Grace now spends her whole life putting on a front that you don't ever mess with her. But behind closed doors, she secretly wants to be quite girly – although she'd never, ever show that!&quot; Grace enjoys being involved in a criminal life style.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; She wants to prove to her father she can &quot;handle herself in a man's world&quot;. She likes to have power over other people and use it to her advantage. Wall has said that Grace is &quot;clever&quot;, &quot;two-faced&quot; and &quot;sly&quot; and different to her sister Clare.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt;

In July 2014, executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] announced that he had planned to change Grace's characterisation.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; He told Kilkelly that &quot;I acknowledge that we didn't get Grace's character right at first and I feel I let Tamara Wall down.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; He was pleased with Wall's performance as Grace and was eager to explore other aspects of the character's personality.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; Kirkwood's team put much work into further developing Grace and allowing Wall to bring warmth to her on-screen counterpart's persona.&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; Writers used an existing character, [[Esther Bloom]] (Jazmine Franks) and made her Grace's best friend and &quot;very surprising sidekick&quot;. Kirkwood believed it would throw Grace into a non-criminal world and see her behave different, smile more, show a softer side and offer the audience a chance to witness &quot;other facets to her character.&quot;&lt;ref name=dsprodint&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks producer: 'Grace Black will show a softer side'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a584267/hollyoaks-producer-grace-black-will-show-a-softer-side/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood later reflected that the changes had given her family, friends and &quot;a great big beating heart&quot;. He remained committed to Grace doing bad deeds but hoped her development made the audience care about her more.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirkwoodinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks producer Bryan Kirkwood shares show gossip and teasers|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a610302/hollyoaks-producer-bryan-kirkwood-shares-show-gossip-and-teasers/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Writers played Grace trying to change her behaviour in preparation for motherhood. This added to the character's likeability with fans but Wall also wanted to keep Grace's dangerous side prevalent.&lt;ref name=series/&gt; She stated &quot;I like the fact that she’s more likeable now, but it’s much more fun playing her as a baddie. As long as I get to walk through the village with a buggy in one hand and a gun in the other – I’ll be happy!&quot;&lt;ref name=series&gt;{{cite web|title=Tamara Wall: Grace Black will be bad again|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/leisure/showbiz/11747253.Tamara_Wall__Grace_Black_will_be_bad_again/|website=[[Waltham Forest Guardian]]|publisher=([[Newsquest]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actress later reflected on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from ''[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]'' that Grace was a &quot;one dimensional&quot; character when she debuted. She observed a &quot;big old change&quot; and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; She became friendlier as a result of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; She can be &quot;a little bit of a freak&quot; in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her &quot;happily ever after&quot;. Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding &quot;the best thing about her is that I still get to be the big evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I get to have a love story.&quot;&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopper|first1=Ellie|title=Exclusive: Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall reveals what's next for the Gloved Hand Killer|url=http://lifestyle.one/closer/entertainment/soaps/exclusive-hollyoaks-tamara-wall-reveals-whats-next-gloved-hand-killer/|website=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]|publisher=([[Bauer Media Group]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace &quot;will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: More gossip and teasers from show boss Bryan Kirkwood|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a610380/hollyoaks-more-gossip-and-teasers-from-show-boss-bryan-kirkwood/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hollyoaks'' wardrobe department aim to dress their characters to reflect their financial earnings. Grace earns a considerable amount of money in her line of work. Therefore, she is one of the shows most expensive characters to supply clothing for.&lt;ref name=styleinfo/&gt; When Wall is required to appear on-screen undressed she has to have a scar applied to her stomach.

Producers later made a series of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they introduced a new hairstyle, which has been described as an &quot;enormous bouffant hair-do&quot;.&lt;ref name=hairstyle/&gt; Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an ''[[Inside Soap]]'' reporter that &quot;as soon as I got this big hair, I felt the character get bigger.

====Backstory and introduction====
In the character's backstory, Fraser raised Grace and Clare as a single parent. He put his efforts into raising Clare, believing Grace was adapt to look after herself.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; Their mother had walked out on them to escape Fraser's criminal life and started a new family.&lt;ref name=oaks/&gt; Fraser also raised Trevor but he had become romantically involved with Clare and got her pregnant. Grace secretly had feelings for Trevor too.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt; Grace and Clare did not get along with each other. When Clare died it made Grace reflect on the relationship and realise she loved her sister. But Grace is upset that she never told her how she felt. This is the main motive Grace has in wanting revenge against her killer.&lt;ref name=dsinterview1/&gt;

''Hollyoaks'' had a long-running theme of having a &quot;dark gangster corner of the show&quot; first created with the character [[Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)|Scott Anderson]] ([[Daniel Hyde]]). Grace was brought into the show to fill that role of the gangster running The Loft night club.&lt;ref name=kirkwoodinterview/&gt; When Grace arrives in the village she is determined to find out the truth behind Clare's death. She knows [[Doctor Browning]] (Joseph Thompson) killed her sister in a [[hit and run]] incident and wants revenge. She notices [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) and [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) behaving suspiciously and begins to monitor them. She also confronts [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) about Clare. Grace does not realise the three characters are covering up the murder of Doctor Browning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks': Clare Devine's sister Grace arrives – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a528769/hollyoaks-clare-devines-sister-grace-arrives-spoiler-pictures/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey becomes suspicious of Grace as soon as they meet. Austin told Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] that &quot;Grace is quite intimidating. Considering her relations, I don't think she's going to be the nicest of characters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks' Sophie Austin interview: 'Lindsey is petrified'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a529360/hollyoaks-sophie-austin-interview-lindsey-is-petrified/|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has an problematic relationship with Fraser because she believes that he loved Clare more.&lt;ref name=casting/&gt; The show began to develop Grace's first feud storyline for Grace with Mercedes. When Mercedes receives Doctor Browning's life insurance money she flaunts her wealth in the village. This infuriates Grace and her hatred for Mercedes grows. She visits Trevor and makes it clear she intends to get revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Mercedes infuriates dangerous Grace – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a540169/hollyoaks-mercedes-infuriates-dangerous-grace-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace's first feud with another gangster was quickly deployed on-screen. [[Ray McCormick]] ([[Cristian Solimeno]]) was introduced as an enemy of the Black family and targets Grace specifically. He kidnaps Grace, locks her away and demands ransom money in exchange for Grace's safety. Trevor becomes determined to secure her release and concocts a scam to steal Mercedes' money.&lt;ref name=solimeno&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=EastEnders wedding, Emmerdale fire, Hollyoaks kidnap, Corrie newcomer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a538347/eastenders-wedding-emmerdale-fire-hollyoaks-kidnap-corrie-newcomer/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray then dresses as [[Father Christmas]] and attends Fraser's wedding to [[Sandy Roscoe]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). He leaves a note for Fraser to aggrivate him about his missing daughter's whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Sinister visitor at Fraser's wedding – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a540352/hollyoaks-sinister-visitor-at-frasers-wedding-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers soon escalated the feud into violence. Grace escapes and Trevor begins a scam selling counterfeit wine.

===Fraser's lies and murder===
Grace's relationship with Fraser is made more complicated when he reveals that he has fathered a child with [[Tegan Lomax]] (Jessica Ellis).&lt;ref name=lomax/&gt; She decides to interfere with his personal life. Grace befriends Tegan who is initially wary of Grace. She pretends to want her half-sister, Rose, in her life to which Tegan agrees. She invites Tegan on a day out in the countryside. Grace then attempts to bribe Tegan with money to leave the village for good. Ellis told Kilkelly that her character is shocked by Grace's behaviour and refuses to leave.&lt;ref name=lomax/&gt; She added &quot;if there's an issue, it's one that Grace needs to sort out with her dad. Tegan isn't having any of it.&quot; This infuriates Grace who threatens her over the edge of a cliff. Ellis said that Tegan realises what Grace is capable of and is terrified of being killed. Ellis and Wall filmed the cliff-top scenes on a cold and rainy day. Wall was scared that she would accidentally push her co-star off the cliff.&lt;ref name=lomax&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks star Jessica Ellis on clifftop drama: 'Tegan is terrified'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a554584/hollyoaks-star-jessica-ellis-on-clifftop-drama-tegan-is-terrified/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hollyoaks'' created a &quot;[[Whodunit]]&quot; storyline in which Fraser is murdered. Viewers would be left guessing the identity of the killer in the episodes that followed. The show released a promotional video revealing the suspects. Grace and Trevor were amongst the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Marc|title=Who killed Fraser Black?

Fraser believed that they betrayed him and was considering having them killed. Tyler from ''Inside Soap'' reported that Grace realises she will be killed unless she take her own father out first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Laura-Jayne|title=Who killed Fraser?|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=19–25 April 2014|issue=15|pages=Laura-Jayne Who killed Fraser?|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy's son [[Joe Roscoe]] ([[Ayden Callaghan]]) is determined to get Fraser out of the Roscoe family. He asks Trevor for help killing Fraser, who then brings Grace in on their plan. Grace is happy to oblige having fallen out with her father.&lt;ref name=limousine/&gt; Fraser and Sandy plan to travel by limousine to a special event. Grace, Trevor and Joe plan to lock Fraser in the vehicle and release poisonous gas to kill him. Grace betrays Joe and plans to frame him solely for the crime and also ensure Sandy dies too. The plot does go ahead but when Joe realises Sandy is in the limousine he rescues them from death.&lt;ref name=limousine&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fraser's death ride!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=12–18 April 2014|issue=14|pages=30|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser is later shot dead and Grace is genuinely angry and upset. She is left with Fraser's business and finances after his death. This makes other characters suspicious of her, believing she planned his murder for financial gain.&lt;ref name=aasinterview/&gt; Grace is a main suspect in the police investigation. Wall said &quot;right after Fraser is killed, Grace is on the warpath to try and blame someone for the crime.&quot; She wants to frame Tegan for the murder but later discovers a bag of clothes in Trevor's flat which leads her to believe he killed Fraser. Grace has him arrested, the actress reflected that it &quot;is awful, not only has she lost her dad, she's lost the love of her life.&quot;&lt;ref name=aasinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall on Fraser death: 'Grace tries to blame someone'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a563065/hollyoaks-tamara-wall-on-fraser-death-grace-tries-to-blame-someone/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor is released when Mercedes comes forward as his alibi, revealing they were having sex when Fraser was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Mercedes McQueen to blackmail Trevor Royle|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a582702/hollyoaks-mercedes-mcqueen-to-blackmail-trevor-royle/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace then becomes convinced [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) killed him.

===Wrecking ball stunt===
One of Grace's first big stories was announced in December 2013. Grace threatens Freddie telling him that she will harm someone close to him if he does not kill Mercedes for her. He refuses and Grace follows through with her plan. Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that ''Hollyoaks'' had created a dramatic stunt involving a [[wrecking ball]] and a demolition of their council housing set. They added that Grace would trap a character in the disused flats ready for them to be killed in the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks lines up shock wrecking ball stunt|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a540835/hollyoaks-lines-up-shock-wrecking-ball-stunt/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddie's brother Joe was later revealed to be Grace's target. ''Hollyoaks'' released promotional pictures of the character being showered with debris from the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kikelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Grace Black's murder target confirmed – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a544144/hollyoaks-grace-blacks-murder-target-confirmed-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Holloaks'' led viewers to believe that Joe had been killed off in the scenes. Fraser involved himself to ensure Grace was not reprimanded for the crime. He tells Grace that Joe died in the demolition and he disposed of the body.&lt;ref name=wreckballstunt/&gt; Writers played Grace being guilt ridden in the weeks of episodes that followed the stunt. Fraser decides to bring Grace in on a secret to ease her guilt. The show aired surprise scenes in which Fraser takes Grace to a private hospital where Joe is alive, but comatose and being cared for.&lt;ref name=wreckballstunt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Joe Roscoe still alive after council flats demolition|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a552470/hollyoaks-joe-roscoe-still-alive-after-council-flats-demolition/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and Fraser were tasked with keeping Joe's location a secret after everyone believes he left the village. Joe's mother Sandy nearly discovers the secret after Fraser is careless. Then Joe wakes from his coma and Grace considers killing Joe to protect her freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Grace and Fraser face panic over Joe Roscoe|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a559920/hollyoaks-grace-and-fraser-face-panic-over-joe-roscoe/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe fakes amnesia and manages to escape from hospital. It soon becomes clear he has not lost any memories from the incident. Callaghan told Laura-Jayne Tyler from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that &quot;he remembers pretty much everything that happened to him at the hands of Grace.&quot; He added that he wants to protect his mother Sandy, from the Black family now he knows about their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Laura-Jayne|title=While Joe was 'dead', I was lazing about in my pants!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=5–11 April 2014|issue=13|pages=42–43|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace is arrested for the attempted murder of Joe and the case is sent to trial. Mercedes and Freddie become invested in watching Grace to make sure she does not get away with it.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; Grace is confident she will be found not guilty at the trial. Writers played the story to convey Grace having similar power to Fraser. Wall told Laura Withers of ''Inside Soap'' that her character has the &quot;judge in her pocket&quot; and pays to fix the trial. She explained that Grace uses skills learned from her father. Fraser taught her that people in power can be paid off.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; Mercedes discovers Grace's plan and attempts to ruin it. Wall claimed the story showed that Grace appears strong but is &quot;actually prettified&quot; about going to prison. The character avoids a prison sentence when the trial concludes.&lt;ref name=cash&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Withers|first1=Laura|title=Cash for freedom!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=21–27 June 2014|issue=24|pages=12|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feud with Freddie Roscoe===
Grace has a prominent feud with the character Freddie Roscoe.&lt;ref name=feud&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Withers|first1=Laura|title=Fall for Grace!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=22–28 November 2014|issue=46|pages=14–15|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddie manages to secure his release after he receives a false alibi. Grace knows the alibi is false and is furious that Freddie has evaded justice. Wall told Withers that &quot;Grace has been bent on revenge ever since she found out that Freddie killed her dad.&quot;&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; She was willing to forget her vendetta on the condition Freddie was sent to prison. But his release makes Grace &quot;see red&quot; and she wants a &quot;showdown&quot; with her nemesis. The actress said that at this point in the story Trevor is fed up with Grace and Freddie's feud. He issues an ultimatum that if she wants to start a family, she must leave Freddie alone.&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; Grace ignores Trevor's warnings and she goes to confront him at her night club where they brawl on the outside balcony. Writers included a &quot;deadly turn&quot; in the story, where there fight escalates and Freddie knocks Grace over the balcony and she falls to the ground. Wall said that writers made in unclear to her whether Freddie did it intentionally or accidentally, but noted &quot;it would certainly make life easier for Freddie if Grace were dead.&quot;&lt;ref name=feud/&gt; ''Hollyoaks'' hired a stunt double during filming as they could not expect Wall to perform a 12-foot fall.&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview/&gt;

Grace has to become secretive about her revenge plans as not to upset Trevor who wants a normal family life. Wall commented &quot;It's a bit of a tough situation for Grace, because she's stuck in the middle. She could either be the baddie and get revenge, or she could turn her back, let bygones be bygones and be a family woman.&quot;&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Tamara Wall: 'Grace wants revenge against Freddie'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a611974/hollyoaks-tamara-wall-grace-wants-revenge-against-freddie/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grace decides on a new revenge plot against Freddie. Mercedes disappears in mysterious circumstances and the police believe she has been murdered when they find traces of her blood. Flashback scenes aired revealed Grace was behind Mercedes' disappearance and she sets out to frame Freddie for her murder. She plant evidence in Freddie's flat so that he is arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kikelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Grace frames Freddie for murder|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a624234/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-grace-frames-freddie-for-murder/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hollyoaks'' had been secretive about whether or not Mercedes had been killed by Grace.

===Relationship with Trevor Royle===
''Hollyoaks'' created Grace's first relationship storyline alongside Trevor. The plot commenced on-screen December 2013 when the duo kissed for the first time. Grace becomes jealous of Trevor charming Mercedes in his attempts to con her. When Trevor confronts her jealous behaviour Grace admits she has romantic feelings for him and they get together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks: Trevor Royle, Grace Black share kiss – spoiler pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a535421/hollyoaks-trevor-royle-grace-black-share-kiss-spoiler-pictures/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and Trevor's relationship is forbidden by disapproving Fraser, and they see each other in secret.

Wood described the relationship as a first for Trevor because he deeply cares and loves Grace unlike his previous romances.&lt;ref name=lomaxdeal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks: Greg Wood talks Trevor Royle's shock police decision|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a546900/hollyoaks-greg-wood-talks-trevor-royles-shock-police-decision/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall hoped that Grace and Trevor would become the show's &quot;new power couple&quot;. She wanted them to have a similar relationship to [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), a well known married couple from the rival soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]''.&lt;ref name=denangie/&gt; Though she noted &quot;Grace and Trevor are far more evil&quot;, her character believes her relationship is &quot;the real deal&quot; and Trevor is the only man she cares about. Grace's influence on Trevor is positive and allowed writers to showcase his &quot;soft side&quot;.&lt;ref name=denangie/&gt; When sharing scenes the pair can be shown as quite pleasant characters, Wall said it &quot;it makes them more likeable, even though they are both baddies.&quot; Fans of ''Hollyoaks'' labelled the couple &quot;Trace&quot; and the actress believed the relationship helped viewers warm to her character.&lt;ref name=denangie&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLennan|first1=Patrick|title=Hollyoaks’ Tamara: ‘I hope we become the Den and Angie of Chester!’|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/hollyoaks/hollyoaks-news/hollyoaks-tamara-i-hope-we-become-the-den-and-angie-of-chester-120785/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc. UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wood his character had long hankered for a sense of normality that other characters on the show have. He said that finding love had changed his character's priorities. Grace had become Trevor's main focus and the gangster business played second.&lt;ref name=woodinterview/&gt; In one story, Grace has Trevor arrested for her father's murder. Wood believed that Trevor was understanding of the betrayal because she was grieving. He added that Trevor's understanding was the reason they were able to move on in their relationship.&lt;ref name=woodinterview/&gt;

Grace wants to begin a family but her doctor informs her the chances are low because of injuries sustained by a gun shot. She decides to try [[IVF]] treatment in order to conceive.&lt;ref name=bigbobarrives/&gt; She tells Trevor she wants to focus on a future that does not involve crime. Wall told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that &quot;Grace doesn't want to be evil any more.&quot; She noted that Trevor had long wanted to change but Grace was &quot;more stubborn about it&quot;. When Grace announced her intention to have IVF, Trevor is delighted. Wall said it was a &quot;cute&quot; moment for the couple because they are so happy.&lt;ref name=bigbobarrives/&gt;

In 2015, producers built Grace and Trevor's family unit by introducing his son [[Dylan Jenkins]] (James Fletcher). His arrival sends their lives into disarray but Grace does try and make an effort with him. She agrees to go to his school parents evening, but dresses inappropriately. In comedic scenes Dylan is embarrassed by Grace's revealing outfit which attracts the attention of male students who begin wolf-whistling at her. Wall said &quot;lets face it, Grace and Trevor are not your average parents, are they?&quot;&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt;

Writers plagued the duo with more relationship dramas such as Grace's affair with Kim and the introduction of Trevor's ex-girlfriend and Dylan's mother, [[Val Jenkins]] (Tanya Robb). When Grace makes a harsh comment regarding the death of Phoebe, Trevor is furious and they argue. Val uses the opportunity to spend time with Trevor helping him with house work. This makes Grace jealous, who views Val as a love-rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks death to spark tension between Grace and Trevor|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a653215/hollyoaks-death-to-spark-tension-between-grace-and-trevor/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace's concerns are proved correct Val kisses Trevor. Robb told an ''Inside Soap'' reporter that Val wants to give Dylan a &quot;normal family life&quot;. She believed her character did not want to ruin Grace's relationship but thought it felt natural to try. Trevor does not reciprocate but Grace finds evidence of their kiss and it causes more problems for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Val kisses Trevor!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=13–19 June 2015|issue=23|pages=26|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also face another set back when Grace wrongly presumes Trevor has slept with [[Porsche McQueen]] ([[Twinnie-Lee Moore]]). Grace forces Trevor to take a lie detector test to prove his innocence. Wall said it was an example of her character behaving anxiously because she is about to achieve her dreams of a complete family. She does not want Trevor to ruin it by cheating, Wall added &quot;She's probably quite worried all the time that he's going to go off with some beautiful, normal girl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Naomi|last1=Harris|title=Take the lie detector test!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=14–20 March 2015|issue=10|pages=12–13|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trevor is arrested for a series of murders which occurred at the local hospital. He is wrongly accused as viewers knew that Lindsey was the serial killer, dubbed the &quot;Gloved Hand Killer&quot;.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt; Wall said her character knows Trevor better than anyone and knows he would not have committed these crimes. She sets out to prove his innocence but Lindsey is actively trying to frame Trevor. Wall likened Grace trying to complete a puzzle as she goes out to find clues that lead to the actual killer. Grace realises that Charlie Dean (Charlie Behan) knows something about the actual culprit. Wall said that Grace is true to form and behaves &quot;very aggressive&quot;, kidnaps him and tries to force Charlie to talk.&lt;ref name=wallcloseinterview/&gt;

===Feud with Big Bob===

===Esther Bloom friendship and surrogacy===
[[File:Jazmine Franks.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Jazmine Franks (''pictured'') plays Grace's best friend Esther Bloom.]]
After the siege Grace and Esther build a strong friendship. It was the relationship writers used to develop Grace's softer side.&lt;ref name=dsprodint/&gt; Wall viewed Grace and Esther's friendship as a completely &quot;random&quot; but &quot;brilliant&quot; pairing. She was happy with the progression of their friendly dynamic, which resulted in the two characters always looking after one another. The actress also believed it made both characters' stories take a &quot;perfect&quot; path. She also enjoyed working on the relationship because of Franks' funny personality.&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview/&gt;

Grace is told she cannot get pregnant and IVF is unlikely to help. She then shows an interest in Esther's health and her sudden concern makes Esther suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Grace and Trevor face new baby setback|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a599837/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-grace-and-trevor-face-new-baby-setback/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace asks Esther to be a surrogate mother for her and tries to bully her into helping. When Grace leaves Esther alone she agrees to help.&lt;ref name=jazinterview/&gt; Grace, Trevor and Esther attend a meeting at the hospital to discuss their plans. The doctor informs Grace that Esther would be the child's legal mother, despite using Grace's egg. Grace is not fazed but Trevor has some reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Esther attends surrogacy appointment|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a603933/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-esther-attends-surrogacy-appointment/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrogacy plan is successful and Esther becomes pregnant.&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt; Franks was surprised when producers pitched the storyline to her. She was happy to be trusted with the story and added that Esther is &quot;too nice&quot; and ultimately could not refuse to help Grace. The actress believed viewers that would have never imagined the three characters working together.&lt;ref name=jazinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks' Jazmine Franks: 'I'm over the moon with surrogacy plot'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a603437/hollyoaks-jazmine-franks-im-over-the-moon-with-surrogacy-plot/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers played scenes which sometimes threatened Grace's happiness. Early on in the pregnancy they created a medical scare for Esther. When she feels unwell Grace worries and rushes Esther to hospital.&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt; But after a check-up and scan the pregnancy is fine. Grace and Trevor witness Esther's ultrasound scan and see their baby for the first time. Wall said &quot;it's lovely, it hits them that they're really going to have a child! There aren't very many warm moments in Grace and Trevor's lives, but this is definitely one of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=hairstylequote/&gt;

Writers began developing a new romance for Esther while she carried Grace's child. Esther meets [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]) who asks her on a date. Esther invites Grace along and Kim presumes they are in a relationship. Grace is privy to their misunderstanding and urges them to get together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoiler pictures: Esther's new romance plot begins|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a606449/hollyoaks-spoiler-pictures-esthers-new-romance-plot-begins/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Spy's Kilkelly revealed that Grace would soon regret her decision.

Esther confronts Grace when she realises that Kim has ended their relationship because of Grace's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=Hollyoaks: Esther Bloom discovers Grace sabotaged her relationship|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a607598/hollyoaks-esther-bloom-discovers-grace-sabotaged-her-relationship/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wall told Kilkelly that if Esther tried to keep the baby it would destroy their friendship.&lt;ref name=wallfallinterview/&gt; Esther gives birth to a baby boy named Curtis.

She explained that Esther always knew the baby was for Grace but she has an unforeseen attachment to Curtis. Esther feels maternal to the baby and she had not expected it to happen when she first agreed to be a surrogate for Grace. Franks added that &quot;she's scared that Trevor and Grace are not fit parents.&quot;&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;

===Kim Butterfield's obsession===
Producers created an infidelity story for Grace with Kim. Kate Thomas from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported that Grace and Kim would share a kiss and the latter Kim then develop an &quot;unhealthy obsession&quot; with Grace.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Kate|title=Spoiler alert: Hollyoaks' Kim and Grace share a kiss while Mercedes makes a sensational comeback in dramatic Spring trailer|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3018372/Mercedes-makes-sensational-comeback-dramatic-Hollyoaks-Spring-trailer.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[DMG Media]])|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promotional trailer followed which showcased Kim's behaviour intensifying when she begins a diary about her interaction with Grace. Wood-Davis told Daniel Kilkelly that Kim notes down each time Grace touches her and even logs their conversations. She also keeps a picture of Grace hidden in her bra.&lt;ref name=dsint&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks star Daisy Wood-Davis on Kim's dark side: 'She's obsessed'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a639520/hollyoaks-star-daisy-wood-davis-on-kims-dark-side-shes-obsessed/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress admitted Kim quickly became obsessed with Grace because &quot;really sets her heart racing and she can't get her out of her mind.&quot; She loves Esther but Grace brings danger into her life.&lt;ref name=dsint/&gt;

Grace is sent to prison awaiting trial for her involvement in the supposed murder of Mercedes. Wall explained that her character refused to tell the truth about Mercedes being alive. She fears Esther will back out of their surrogacy deal if she knows that she carried on her feud with Freddie against her wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Alison|title=‘I think Reenie and Grace could kill each other!’ says Hollyoaks’ Tamara Wall|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/hollyoaks/hollyoaks-news/i-think-reenie-and-grace-could-kill-each-other-says-hollyoaks-tamara-wall-79102/|website=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[Time Inc.

She believes Grace is the only one to make her feel complete. Kim knows it is unlikely she will get the chance to be with Grace. So when she enters prison she schemes against Grace's cell mate [[Reenie McQueen]] ([[Zöe Lucker]]), resulting in Kim being moved into Grace's cell. Wood-Davis said that it marked the first time Grace became unnerved by Kim's behaviour.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Carena|title=Grace lights a fire in Kim that gets her heart racing!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|date=25 April – 8 May 2015|issue=347|pages=36, 37|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood-Davis viewed Kim and Grace as an &quot;odd pairing and very unexpected&quot; who bonded over their shared love of Esther. Grace is scared at the prospect of permanent imprisonment and feels vulnerable. She opens up to Kim about her deteriorating relationship with Trevor because she is someone familiar. But Kim uses this as an opportunity to seduce Grace who responds positively and the pair have sex. The development lead writers to play the Kim character even crazier over Grace, thinking she and Grace will be together upon their release from prison. Wood-Davis said Kim thinks &quot;she's found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.&quot;&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; Wall told Sally Brockway from ''[[Soaplife]]'' Grace does not realise &quot;how insane Kim is&quot;.

This allowed the actors to act as though they were driving the vehicle despite the stunt man being in control.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; The car which contains Kim and Esther was crashed using a police van which collides with it. The car crash stunt itself was filmed separate and actors were not required to be in the vehicles at that point.&lt;ref name=stunt/&gt; Real fire, smoke, fire engines and fire fighters were included in the scenes to help create an authentic scene of mayhem during the post-crash scenes.

Wall told Alison Gardner from ''[[What's on TV]]'' that Grace feels &quot;jittery&quot; in the days before her wedding because she is thinks Trevor is having an affair. Grace is terrified that she will be jilted. She described a pivotal scene in the story in which Grace and Trevor discuss her childhood dreams.

===Introduction of family===
In 2016, producers created an extended family for Grace. First they cast the roles of half-brothers [[Liam Donovan|Liam]] (Maxim Baldry), [[Jesse Donovan|Jesse]] (Luke Jerdy) and [[Adam Donovan (Hollyoaks)|Adam Donovan]] (Jimmy Essex).

They conversed about Grace's history within ''Hollyoaks'' to help with their introduction to the show.&lt;ref name=jerdyinterview/&gt; Liam is introduced to the show first. Grace is annoyed when she notices him and gives him money to leave the village for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Grace Black turns to bribery when she sees her brother Liam Donovan tonight|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a788710/hollyoaks-spoilers-liam-donovan-grace-black-have-a-frosty-family-reunion-tonight/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerdy told Kilkelly that Jesse and Liam were influenced by Adam's estranged relationship with Grace. They had a problematic dynamic and his negative stories about Grace clouded their judgement. Jerdy believed that Jesse feels guilty about the scam because he is the first brother to care about Grace. He noted that Liam has a &quot;colder&quot; personality and does not feel any remorse for trying to scam his sister.&lt;ref name=jerdyinterview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=Hollyoaks newcomer Luke Jerdy on Jesse and Liam Donovan's big con: &quot;Grace could be quite scary&quot;|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/interviews/a797187/hollyoaks-spoilers-luke-jerdy-on-jesse-liam-donovan-conning-grace/|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=11 August 2016|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kiwi Black''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #429.

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of Kiwi Black, apart from that his mother is from [[Ruatoki]], [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Atlas'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; and his father, Azazel, seduced her.  Because of this Kiwi Black is the half-brother of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #428 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Kiwi Black is in reference to his mother's homeland New Zealand, Kiwi - indigenous bird of New Zealand, it is also common for New Zealanders to refer to themselves as Kiwis. The &quot;Black&quot; is in reference to the names of New Zealand sports teams the most popular being the [[All Blacks]] Rugby team. Others include the [[Tall Blacks]] (basketball) Black Sticks (hockey) the Black Caps (cricket).{{issue|date=March 2013}}

He was a mutant bred by [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] to help him transport his army to [[Earth]] from the hellish dimension they had been trapped in.  However, after he survived a summoning ritual (one of three to survive) meant to free Azazel's army, he started secretly operating within Azazel's castle to free the X-Men. Kiwi rejected his father’s influence, and allied himself with the [[X-Men]] in order to eliminate Azazel’s army. In the process, he decapitated one of Azazel's thugs and gained respect from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Decimation/M-Day===
After M-Day, it was revealed that Kiwi Black was among the many mutants depowered, as listed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], alongside his half-brother Abyss.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Kiwi Black can focus bio-energy through his body to increase the potency of his physical attacks as well as his already impressive strength from his natural physical build. His energy-empowered attacks are so powerful because of his ability to release energy at the point of contact, which enhances his strength to the point where he can break through boulders with his bare hands or create a gigantic crater by simply kicking the ground. His creator [[Chuck Austen]] has described these attacks as &quot;being hit with a sledgehammer shot out of a cannon at 220 MPH&quot;.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

By using this method of energy transference as well as others he has developed, Kiwi Black is able to use his energy to affect the surrounding area or another person. He can touch someone and use intricate combinations of his energy and theirs to cause internal malfunctions in the person, such as heart failure or even scrambled superpowers.  By slamming his fist into the ground, he can direct energy through it to make a pillar of rock/spikes rise up.

Marcus Daniels was born in [[Flushing, Queens]], New York City. He was working as a laboratory assistant to Dr. Abner Croit, a physicist hoping to build a device capable of tapping into energies from other dimensions. Croit always looked down on Daniels’ inferior knowledge, making him feel useless. Daniels always wondered what it would be like to harness the energy they were researching, to be powerful. After an accident bathed him in the extra-dimensional energy of the [[Darkforce]], he had the chance to find out. Calling himself Blackout, his body was now flushed with power, becoming a surface of control of the Darkforce dimension. However, despite his powers threatening to go out of control, he escaped from Croit's attempts to cure him and fled.

Blackout returned to the laboratories, however, as he needed the stabilizer device to control his energies. But he also returned to find revenge on Croit— Blackout's sanity began to suffer as well. He believed Croit was researching energies from &quot;Black Stars&quot; and that his body now generated such energy. He further believed that Croit was defrauding the government with his research and had bribed a judge to frame him for stealing his secrets. Instead of an accident causing his powers, Daniels thought Dr. Croit willfully subjected him to an experiment in exchange for dropping charges against him.

[[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] encountered Blackout on his way to exact revenge, and Blackout easily defeated the young hero. Before Nova could catch up with him, Blackout returned to the labs, killing Croit and his new assistant by letting them “merge with the color spectrum” (actually, by shunting them to the Darkforce dimension). Following another skirmish with Nova, Blackout himself vanished into this dimension when he fell back onto the stabilizer during the battle, destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

The stabilizer somehow ended up at [[Project Pegasus]], the government energy research laboratory. An attack by the Lava Men and the presence of [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] (Monica Rambeau) managed to activate the device, which transported Blackout back to Earth. Still suffering from the delusion that Croit was still alive and out to harm him, he tried to escape. Blackout was coerced by another Project captive, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], into freeing herself and other superhuman criminals [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] in order to gain revenge on their captors. The villains were confronted by the Avengers, but Blackout and Moonstone escaped to the Darkforce Dimension by nearly causing the nuclear core of the complex to melt down as a distraction.

Moonstone, a former psychiatrist, treated Blackout in order to learn his true origin, but he remained in an irrational state. When the Avengers tracked them down, Blackout opened up another aperture into the Darkforce dimension in attempting to escape them, sucking himself and Moonstone inside.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #236-238&lt;/ref&gt; Moonstone helped Blackout navigate through the dimension, eventually arriving on the surface of the moon. She hoped to find another stone similar to that which gave her powers, but they encountered the [[Inhumans (comics)|Inhumans]] and their ally, [[Dazzler]], who defeated the villains and returned them to Project: Pegasus on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Dazzler'' #32&lt;/ref&gt;

Moonstone next appeared recruited by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] to form his version of the [[Masters of Evil]], and she brought Blackout in tow. By this time, Blackout's mental condition was so unstable that at times he sank into a nearly catatonic state, only responsive to Moonstone's manipulative commands. Zemo, however, with the help of the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] had created a device to mentally force Blackout to obey his commands. Blackout was instrumental in Zemo's takeover of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' [[Avengers Mansion|headquarters]] by sending the entire mansion into the Darkforce dimension in one of the team’s darkest hours. [[Doctor Druid]], used his psychic ability to break through Zemo and Moonstone’s manipulations, restoring some of Blackout’s mental faculties. With relative sanity restored, Blackout resisted Zemo's mental commands, the strain of which made Blackout collapse from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #273-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout's body was remanded into the custody of the Commission on Superhuman Activities. Years later, his body was taken by Baron Zemo, manipulated like a puppet on strings to serve as a member of his team as he confronted the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] over the life of their member [[Genis-Vell|Photon]]. During the battle between the two teams, Zemo revealed Blackout was merely a shell in which he kept the [[Smuggler (comics)|Smuggler]] trapped. This had the desired effect of turning his brother, [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] against his team, and Zemo gained the upper hand. He also used Blackout’s access to the Darkforce dimension in severing Photon’s physical form.

A person who looks like the original Blackout appears as part of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s alliance with super-powered heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #61&lt;/ref&gt; He was later seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Blackout was a darkness-generating superhuman and professional criminal who first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]'' #2 (1990). He has the ability to automatically generate a light-dampening field which negates all visible light in a significant area. His albino-esque complexion and extreme physical sensitivity to sunlight and light in general likely accounts for this power-manifestation, and its vampiric similarities apparently led him to have his teeth and fingernails replaced with mechanically-enhanced metal ones.

Blackout was initially employed by the demonic crime lord [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] as an enforcer and assassin. Deathwatch ordered Blackout to search for bio-toxin canisters stolen by a youth gang named the Cypress Hill Jokers under their leader Paulie Stratton. Blackout murdered detective Frank Loretti and his family as well as Ralph D'Amato's parents before battling the Ghost Rider ([[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch]]) for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #2&lt;/ref&gt; Deathwatch and Blackout then attacked the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]]'s 75th Precinct police station, murdered several police officers, stole the bio-toxin canisters, and abducted Paulie and the Cypress Hill Jokers. Subsequently, Blackout battled the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s men as well as Ghost Rider again. Blackout was disfigured in the battle when he was scorched by hellfire by trying to bite through Ghost Rider's jacket. This caused him to become Ghost Rider's sworn arch-enemy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #3&lt;/ref&gt; Blackout learned Ghost Rider's identity as Dan Ketch, and murdered his comatose sister Barbara Ketch in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #7&lt;/ref&gt; Blackout then kills Ketch's acquaintances, newspaper vendor Theodore Larsen and Father Michael McDonald.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #8&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout continued to stalk Ghost Rider. He encountered [[HEART (comics)|HEART]], and menaced some [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] children, murdering the Morlock [[Pixie (Morlock)|Pixie]] (not to be confused with the X-Men character of the same name, [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]]). The Morlocks had been in conflict over a plan to change babies into mutated forms. Ghost Rider's incorrect belief it was Blackout behind the vanishing of babies brings the attention of the real Blackout. Though the children are rescued safely, with the assistance of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], Blackout manages to kill Pixie and escape after battling Ghost Rider again.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #9 (Jan. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout murdered several sewer workers, then battled Ghost Rider, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] and HEART again; during this battle, his face is further disfigured by Blaze's gun, and Blackout was finally captured by the police.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #14-15&lt;/ref&gt; He was freed from prison by the [[Firm (comics)|Firm]], then abducted Ketch's mother and friends, seemingly murdering Dan Ketch by tearing his throat out while he is in human form. Only supernatural intervention from other sources allows Dan to recover. In the meantime, Ghost Rider is still able to fight. Around this time, Blackout went on a murderous rampage through [[Central Park]], leading to a hostage situation with the police. With Mr. Stern, Blackout is captured by Ghost Rider and sealed in a [[mausoleum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #25&lt;/ref&gt;

With Mr. Stern, Blackout escaped the mausoleum. Blackout experienced a vision of [[Lilith (Marvel Comics)#Mother of All Demons|Lilith]], the demon-goddess, who claimed she was his grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #28&lt;/ref&gt; Blackout joined forces with Lilith and the Lilin, and would team up with many super-powered offspring of Lilith, all doing her will. Blackout, [[Creed (comics)|Creed]], and [[Pilgrim (comics)|Pilgrim]] abducted John Blaze's son, then battled Blaze and Ghost Rider.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirits of Vengeance'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Lilth and the Lilin, Blackout battled Ghost Rider, John Blaze, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Dr. Michael Morbius]], the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]], and the [[Darkhold|Darkhold Redeemers]] in [[Greenland]]. [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] impaled Blackout through the eye, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #31&lt;/ref&gt; Blackout was later reborn along with the rest of his fallen brethren, thanks to Lilith. He has a fresh new face but it is burned in battle with Ghost Rider.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #41 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

During one of his many times working with Lilith, he re-inspires the police officer Badilino into becoming [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]] again. Wracked with doubt after learning his demonic mission means little, Badilino is frozen with indecision as Lilith's forces, Blackout, Dark Legion and Meatmarket attack his precinct. Seeing Blackout threaten to consume a small child, Badilino transforms and literally leaps into action. The child is saved. Blackout takes an opportunity minutes later to attack Dan Ketch's friend Stacy Dolan. She is saved by Ghost Rider. Blackout and the Lilin are distracted by the arrival of [[Doctor Strange]] and other [[Midnight Sons]], who are their primary objective. A spell, cast as the Sons retreat from overwhelming forces, protects the citizens in the precinct from being seen by Lilin.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #44 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

After being defeated by the [[Midnight Sons]], Blackout had his face deformities repaired and went back to work as a hired assassin, also eliminating a few personal grudges along the way. He becomes romantically obsessed with Wei, a female reporter who has figured out Ghost Rider's secret identity. His murderous torment of Wei causes her to snap and commit suicide live on camera.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #54 (October 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; He is captured by Ghost Rider and chained over the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] where he is thought to have burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #66 (October 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later, Blackout was seen among the escaping villains in the prison breakout in ''New Avengers'' #1, and his sudden lack-of-death is later explained in the ''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'', where it is revealed he was arrested before burning to death.

Blackout was hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #35&lt;/ref&gt; He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', he is one among many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout is later seen aiding [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Danny Ketch]]'s attack and killing [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]] before facing off against [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; He was recruited by Zadikiel to assemble a &quot;task-force&quot; of Ghost Rider foes in order to hunt down and destroy both the Ketch &amp; Blaze Ghost Riders.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' vol. 6 #33&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he attacked the church filled with the gun armed [[nuns]], alongside [[Orb (comics)|Orb]], [[Deacon (comics)|Deacon]] and the new [[Vengeance (comics)|Vengeance]]. He cloaks the place in darkness threatening and mocking the nuns but is stopped by being shot with bullets that were covered in holy water. Blackout runs away screaming in pain into the night.&lt;ref&gt;'' Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor'' vol. 1 #608&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Blackout and [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] assist [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] (in the form of Skadi) in attacking Dayton, Ohio. Since Johnny Blaze is no longer Ghost Rider, a man named Adam performs a ritual in a pyramid in Nicaragua in which one of his followers, a woman named Alejandra, becomes the new female Ghost Rider who is able to defeat Deathwatch and Blackout II.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 7 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappears as one of the villains summoned by Sin to battle Earth's heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself: The Fearless'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to rebuild his reputation, Blackout goes after [[Superior Spider-Man]]. He kidnaps Peter Parker's [[Aunt May]], and holds her hostage, demanding that Parker, as Spider-Man's &quot;tech designer&quot;, hand himself over in exchange. Superior Spider-Man tracks him down, and they fight. Blackout gains the advantage and tries to bite out Spider-Man's neck. Unfortunately for Blackout, Spider-Man was wearing a metal neck cover under his costume, which electrocuted him. Spider-Man then tortured Blackout, ripping out his claws and teeth. In agony, Blackout begs for mercy, promising never to go after anyone Spider-Man knows again. Spider-Man tells him to spread the word to all the other criminals that &quot;Peter Parker is off limits&quot;, then exposes Blackout to artificial sunlight, burning him.&lt;ref&gt;''Superor Spider-Man Annual'' #1 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The first Blackout was exposed to cosmic radiation, giving him the power to tap into the [[Darkforce]], a source of infinite dark energy, and to manipulate it in various ways. He could project Darkforce as concussive energy with tremendous force. Blackout could mentally open portals to and from the Darkforce dimension. He could create and control simple, solid geometric shapes from Darkforce, such as discs, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and planes. These objects absorbed energy directed against them, and would remain solid as long as he exerted conscious control over them. He could psionically levitate Darkforce objects, and could fly by riding on them. Blackout was mentally unstable due to his time spent in the Darkforce Dimension, and sometimes entered a nearly catatonic state. His control over Darkforce was dependent on his mental clarity, and would weaken when he was fatigued. Training with [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] allowed him to maintain his Darkforce constructs for a considerably longer period of time. Blackout wore a costume with circuitry that helped him confine the Darkforce within his body. The costume was designed by Dr. Abner Croit. Blackout had a master's degree in physics, especially in the study of radiation.

The second Blackout is half demon, giving him several superhuman abilities. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes are superhuman. He can see in near darkness, and he has the mystical ability to extinguish both natural and artificial light sources in his immediate vicinity. However, his skin is highly sensitive to light. He has enhanced teeth, jaws, and claws, which he usually employs to tear out the throats of his victims and enemies. He is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant, a superior acrobat, and wrestler.

==In other media==
===Television===
Marcus Daniels appears in the 2014 ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode &quot;[[Providence (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Providence]]&quot;, portrayed by Patrick Brennan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brennan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/2014/3/28/22242/exclusive_patrick_brennan_brings_a_blackout_to_marvels_agents_of_shield. |title=Exclusive: Patrick Brennan Brings a Blackout to Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. |publisher=Marvel |date=March 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OQReELfq?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmarvel.com%2Fnews%2Fmovies%2F2014%2F3%2F28%2F22242%2Fexclusive_patrick_brennan_brings_a_blackout_to_marvels_agents_of_shield. |archivedate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Daniels worked as a lab assistant as part of an experiment to harness Darkforce, but his exposure to that energy gave him the superhuman ability to absorb all forms of energy, even the kinetic energy of firearms. In the episode &quot;Providence&quot;, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] takes over the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility known as the Fridge, where Daniels was incarcerated (thanks to [[Phil Coulson]]), and frees him. In the following episode, &quot;The Only Light in the Darkness&quot; Daniels pursues cellist Audrey Nathan, whom he considered his personal light. Coulson's team confronts him, overloading him with modified spotlights that produce [[gamma radiation]], causing his body to explode.

===Film===
[[Johnny Whitworth]] has confirmed that his character Ray Carrigan in ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'' was based on Marvel's half-demon Blackout. As stated by Whitworth he plays &quot;the villain who, at the beginning, up until like page 70, is human, [...] I'm not a very nice guy. I'm bad. I get turned into, for those who read 'Ghost Rider', the character Blackout. I get turned into him by the devil to complete my job. That gives me the fortitude to fight Ghost Rider and the supernatural abilities to compete on some level with that guy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/128896-blackout-confirmed-for-ghost-rider-spirit-of-vengeance|title=Superherohype.com: Blackout Confirmed for 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film creators have confirmed that the character will not follow the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] mythology of the character and admitted that they based his characterization on the look of the character alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/168750-ghost-rider-sequels-blackout-wont-follow-marvel-mythology|title=Ghost Rider Sequel's Blackout Won't Follow Marvel Mythology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Carrigan is a [[mercenary]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]], and [[gun runner]] who works for Roarke (the human form of the [[Mephisto (comics)|Devil]]). He and his men are hired by Roarke to kidnap Danny, the son of Nadya (a woman who once was an ex-girlfriend of Carrigan and was saved from the brink of death by Roarke). Even though Ray and his men succeeded in capturing Danny, they end up pursued by Nayda and Ghost Rider. After being badly injured during a fight with Ghost Rider at a quarry, Carrigan's body is found dying under some rubble by Roarke. To ensure that Carrigan finishes his job, Roarke uses his powers to heal Carrigan by transforming him into Blackout. A difference between the comics version is that this Blackout has powers over darkness and decay and not a vampire. Blackout's decay powers don't work on a [[Twinkie]] when every other food he tries to eat rapidly decays the moment he touches it. When Ghost Rider, Moreau, and Nadya bring Danny to a holy area where Danny would be protected, the monks there wanted to kill the boy to prevent the Devil from getting them only for Blackout to kill the monks and recapture Danny. During the fight with Roarke to rescue Danny, Moreau sacrifices himself to distract Blackout from attacking Johnny Blaze (who is then repowered by Danny). In the final fight with Ghost Rider on the road, Blackout is killed when Ghost Rider uses the Penance Stare on him and throws him off of Nadya's truck.

===Video games===
* The Marcus Daniels version of Blackout appears in ''[[Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal]]'' as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]].

First appearing in ''Superman'' Vol. 2 #4 (April 1987). An [[African-American]] man named '''Robert DuBois''' has a mental breakdown and becomes obsessed with the [[Vietnam War]], after learning that his brother, Michael aka &quot;Micky&quot; had gone to fight in his place and became a quadruple amputee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | story = Bloodsport! | Title = Superman | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = April, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agent of [[Lex Luthor]] persuades DuBois that [[Superman]] is the enemy and supplies DuBois with a teleporter and weapons including bullets made from [[kryptonite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | story = Bloodsport! | Title = Superman | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = April, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuBois adopts the name Bloodsport, rampaging through Metropolis, and injures Superman with the kryptonite bullets before collapsing when confronted by his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Bloodsport | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 56  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloodsport appears in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' as a villain who ambushes [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Aquaman]] with a group of other villains. He fights [[Iron Man]] and is restrained by Green Lantern.
Bloodsport was killed during a fight with Alex Trent, the secon Bloodsport.

[[Image:Bsport.png|250px|right|thumb|Panel from ''Adventures of Superman'' #507 of Bloodsport II,]]
First appearing in The Adventures of Superman #506, '''Alex Trent''' is a fanatical [[racism|racist]], a member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], a [[white supremacist]] group that [[Perry White]] and [[Franklin Stern]] encountered when they were younger. He adopts the name Bloodsport, ironically used previously by an African American. He also has a similar teleporter grafted into his body, which he can likewise use to summon weapons. He is captured by Superman after [[Ron Troupe]] destroys the warehouse from which he was teleporting his weapons.

Some time later, in an effort to provide an outlet for rising tensions at Stryker's Island Prison, a boxing match between the two Bloodsports is organized.  Trent is able to activate his teleporter, and bring in weaponry. In the resulting confusion, DuBois is killed while trying to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;  Trent is later burned in his prison cell by the Brotherhood for showing weakness in front of DuBois.

The teleporter technology has since been used by the anti-corporate vigilante [[Demolitia]].

===Unnamed===
A new Bloodsport has recently appeared in Superman comics, teaming up with [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]] and [[Riot (DC Comics)|Riot]], but little has been revealed about him thus far.

Bloodsport is seen among the captured villains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. &lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Salvation Run'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunst received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, which was often considered one of the best performances of 2015,&lt;ref name=&quot;screenrant&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffpoperformances2015&quot; /&gt; She won the [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries]], and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016-critics-choice-awards-winners-856447 |title=Critics' Choice Awards: The Complete Winners List |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |author=THR Staff |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/emmy-nominations-2016-full-list-1201786437/|title=The 68th Annual Emmy Nominations: The Complete List|work=[[Deadline.com|Deadline]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=July 14, 2016|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
Peggy Blumquist is a [[hairdresser]] in [[Luverne, Minnesota]] who is married to her high school sweetheart, local [[butcher]] Ed Blumquist. She is dissatisfied with small-town life and wants to take a $500 course in &quot;self-actualization&quot; (which is implied to be a scam) so she can better herself.  This conflicts with Ed's plans to use the money to buy the butcher shop where he works.

One night, she accidentally runs over Rye Gerhardt after he wandered onto the road after spotting a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]. Peggy panics and brings Rye back to her house instead of calling the police; when he regains consciousness and attacks Peggy, Ed kills him to protect her. They dispose of the body and wreck Peggy's car to make it look like Ed crashed it. 

Unbeknownst to Peggy, Rye is a member of the Gerhardt crime family. Deputy Sheriff [[Lou Solverson]] figures out what happened and tries to persuade the Blumquists to come forward so the police can protect them, but Peggy tells him to leave. Peggy at first wants to flee to California, but Ed convinces her to stay. She sells her car so Ed can buy the butcher shop, but Ed tells her that a criminal working for the Gerhardts attacked him and burned the shop down, and that they have to leave town.

When the Gerhardt family matriarch, [[Floyd Gerhardt|Floyd]], learns that Rye was killed by &quot;the butcher&quot;, she mistakenly assumes that Ed is a hitman and sends her eldest son Dodge to kill him. Peggy and Ed manage to subdue Dodd, tie him up and hold him prisoner in their home, planning to give him to a rival crime family in [[Kansas, Missouri]] in return for money and protection. Dodd gets loose of his bindings, however, and attacks Peggy. Just as Dodd is about to kill Peggy and Ed, however, traitorous Gerhardt enforcer Hanzee dispatches him just in time. Moments later, the police arrive and Hanzee opens fire on them; Peggy stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors, and she and Ed are taken into police custody.

The [[Minnesota State Police]] strong-arm Peggy and Ed into wearing [[wiretap]]s when meeting with the Kansas City mob in return for reduced jail time, and place them under proective custody in a hotel. The Gerhardts attack the hotel, believing that Ed has taken Dodge there, and Peggy and Ed flee during the resulting gunfight between the Gerhardts and the police. Ed sees a UFO as they run away, but Peggy dismisses it as &quot;just a flying saucer&quot;.  Hanzee runs after them and mortally wounds Ed, but Peggy manages to drag him into the burned-out butcher shop and hole up in the walk-in freezer. As Peggy frantically tries to figure out a means of escape, Ed says that their relationship has been irreparably damaged by all that has happened; he then dies in her arms. Lou arrests her and takes her to jail. On the way there in Lou's police car, Peggy laments that she just &quot;wanted to be somebody&quot;.

==Production==
[[Noah Hawley]] has stated that when he started writing season two, he initially planned the season out as being more focused on Ed and Peggy instead of being an ensemble drama, saying &quot;this idea of a couple, played by [[Jesse Plemons]] and Kirsten Dunst, who are caught between these two rival crime organizations, the Gerhardt family and the Kansas City mafia. Well, suddenly you have two rival crime organizations that need characters, and you also need your cops who are going to interject themselves between these people. So suddenly you have four or five huge moving pieces that have to be serviced.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Rick|title='Fargo' Boss Noah Hawley Explains Where Season 2 Goes From Here|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fargo-season-two-noah-hawley-831324|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During filming, Dunst purposely did not read any of the non-Ed and Peggy related storylines, saying &quot;Peggy's so in her own world, I didn't want to be influenced by anything else that was happening in the story. So I just would read things that were happening with Ed and Peg. She's so tunnel-visioned about her goals and what needs to happen that I didn't want to think about the whole show. It makes it more fun for me now, because I can watch and enjoy it myself and not know what everyone's going to say.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HRDunst&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Rick|title='Fargo' Star Kirsten Dunst: Peggy's &quot;Mental Illness&quot; Is Manifesting|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fargo-star-kirsten-dunst-peggys-832967|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 19, 2015|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character overview==
{{plot|Character|date=September 2015}}
Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Blundetto is introduced in the second episode of season 5, &quot;[[Rat Pack (The Sopranos episode)|Rat Pack]]&quot;. He is a cousin of Tony Soprano and [[Christopher Moltisanti]]. To distinguish between them, they were called &quot;Tony Uncle Johnny&quot; (Soprano) and &quot;Tony Uncle Al&quot; (Blundetto) when they were kids, after their fathers' first names. Blundetto, Soprano, and Moltisanti all grew up and played on a farm owned by their uncle, [[List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_Soprano_crime_family#Patrizio_.22Uncle_Pat.22_Blundetto|Pat Blundetto]]. Growing up, both Tonys were very close and Blundetto told Moltisanti that he loved Soprano like a brother. The two Tonys would often [[bullying|bully]] Moltisanti. Blundetto is the father of Kelli Blundetto, who is Meadow's contemporary and is said to have run away from home, and identical twin boys Justin and Jason Blundetto, whom he fathered by having Tony Soprano smuggle his [[semen]] out of prison nine years before, while still incarcerated. In the episode &quot;[[Unidentified Black Males]]&quot;, it is also revealed that he has a genius level [[I.Q.]] of 158. He sports a large number of crude [[prison tattoos]], on his forearms, biceps, chest, back, and legs.

In 1986, Blundetto was arrested, tried, and incarcerated for almost 17 years for the armed [[truck hijacking|hijack]]ing of a truck. Soprano was supposed to go along with his cousin the night of the hijacking but was not able to make it due to a severe [[panic attack]] during which he passed out and injured his head, which was caused by an argument with his mother. Although Blundetto doesn't know that's the reason Soprano never showed, Soprano tells Blundetto he was mugged by a group of black men the night of the hijacking, and was knocked unconscious. Soprano strongly believes Blundetto holds some ill-will towards him because Blundetto was busted, went to prison, his wife divorced him, and his daughter ran away, while Soprano prospered, became boss of the family, and was able to send his daughter to an Ivy League university. Blundetto denies this ill will, but Tony still harbors enormous guilt. 

In the Spring of 2004, Blundetto is released from [[Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood]], along with a string of other well-known mobsters, which the media labels &quot;The Class of '04.&quot; These other mobsters include former high-ranking [[caporegime]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna|Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna]], [[Lupertazzi crime family]] [[caporegime]] [[Phil Leotardo]], and former Lupertazzi family [[consigliere]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Lupertazzi crime family#Angelo Garepe|Angelo Garepe]], who returns and decides to stay semi-retired. After Blundetto's [[parole]], he decides not to return to a life of crime and has the incentive to stay straight and clean. Instead, he initially decides to go into [[massage therapy]]. Tony is seemingly disappointed that Blundetto has decided to pursue a legitimate career after he declines Tony's offer to get back started working with the [[DiMeo crime family]] with a stolen airbag scheme Soprano had lined up for him but respects his cousin's decision regardless. Soprano gets his cousin a job working for a laundry company owned by a [[Koreans|Korean]] man named Kim. Kim doesn't trust Blundetto at all and shows his overt racial prejudice against him since he is a white ex-con. When Kim, however, finds out about Blundetto's aspiration to become a professional massage therapist, he begins to take a liking to him and even says he will go in on the business with him 50/50. With the help of Gwen, a girlfriend he met via the Internet while in prison, Blundetto passes his &quot;New Jersey State Massage Licensing Board&quot; exam and is hopeful to open his own massage/spa facility. Kim sets up Blundetto with an empty storefront he owns in [[West Caldwell]] to establish the massage parlor/spa. In the episode &quot;[[Sentimental Education (The Sopranos episode)|Sentimental Education]]&quot;, Blundetto comes across $12,000 in the street, thrown out of a car window by a paranoid drug dealer who believed he was being tailed by the police, and everything appears to be going his way. He manages to start fixing the storefront up, but then goes on a self-destructive tear, staying out nights and blowing much of the remainder of the money on gambling and expensive clothes, to seemingly &quot;keep up&quot; with the modestly wealthy members of Tony's crew, and Tony himself. After fighting on the phone with Gwen, he takes his anger and frustration out in a beating he gives Kim, ostensibly because he has been doing all of the work, and he'd finally had enough. Blundetto then meets Tony Soprano, at Nuovo Vesuvio for a meal. After hinting that he has messed up his business with Kim, Blundetto asks if he still needs someone to cover the airbag scheme, Soprano tells Blundetto &quot;it's hard doing business with strangers&quot; (meaning Kim). At this, Blundetto then begins working with Tony's crew. 

[[Little Carmine]]'s crew simultaneously begins courting Blundetto through his old prison buddy, Angelo Garepe. In an earlier season episode &quot;[[Where's Johnny?]]&quot;, Phil Leotardo had performed a [[mock execution]] on a female [[loan shark]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Lupertazzi crime family#Lorraine Calluzzo|Lorraine Calluzzo]] for siding with Little Carmine during the Lupertazzi power struggle between Carmine and Johnny Sack.  When Lorraine fails to give her money to Sack upfront, Phil gets his younger brother, Billy, and crew-member &quot;Joey Peeps&quot; to shoot Lorraine along with her boyfriend and partner in her shylock business, Jason Evanina, after breaking into her Brooklyn home. In retaliation, Little Carmine loyalists, Rusty Millio and Angelo Garepe offer a contract to Blundetto to murder [[Joey Peeps]] (&quot;[[Marco Polo (The Sopranos episode)|Marco Polo]]&quot;) in retaliation. Although he is reluctant at first, he later accepts the contract after he decided that he isn't moving up fast enough in Soprano's crew. Blundetto shoots Joey, and a prostitute he was seeing, inside his car. but the vehicle still in drive, rolls over his foot. Blundetto limps away from the scene and leaves quickly in his car. In &quot;[[Unidentified Black Males]]&quot;, Soprano discovers Blundetto has a limp. Blundetto lies and says he was jumped by gang members in Newark, while making collections. Soprano learns from Johnny Sack, while playing golf, that a witness got a look at the man who killed Joey Peeps and that the witness said he was limping away from the scene. Soprano instantly puts the puzzle together and has a panic attack on the first tee and collapses. He later confronts Blundetto who calmly pleads his innocence. Although Soprano knows the truth, he tells Sack that Blundetto did not kill Peeps; he knows there would be dire consequences if the truth were known. 

In &quot;[[The Test Dream]]&quot;, Phil and Billy Leotardo shoot Angelo savagely, in the trunk of Phil's car, in revenge for Peeps' death. This drives Blundetto into a rage, and he tracks down the Leotardo brothers one night on a New York street, he wounds Phil and kills Billy. By the end of season 5, Tony Soprano is under heavy pressure to deliver his cousin to Johnny Sack (who has taken over his crime family after Little Carmine's abdication), explicitly so he can be tortured to death by Phil Leotardo.  With his entire crime family now targeted in revenge, Tony Soprano confronts his capos (especially an increasingly vocal Carlo Gervasi), telling them he is giving Blundetto the protection he would give to any of them. But after much prevarication, Soprano realizes that he has to make a painful choice.  He uses a contact at a phone company to track down Blundetto at their Uncle [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family|Pat Blundetto]]'s former farm. Blundetto is coming back from grocery shopping and is ambushed by Soprano who kills him with a [[12-gauge]] shotgun on the porch of the farmhouse. Soprano then tells Johnny Sack where Blundetto is. When Phil arrives later to avenge his brother's death, he finds Blundetto's body lying on a pile of wood on the front porch and is furious to be deprived of his vengeance. [[Tony Soprano]] then tells Christopher Moltisanti to bury his cousin Tony secretly, and in one piece, off the premises. Tony and Johnny reach an accord over Blundetto's demise (which does not come close to satisfying Phil) but Johnny is arrested by the FBI soon afterwards, meaning Tony may have been able to either save his cousin or leave him alone to face off against Phil if he hadn't already killed him.

When Soprano is shot and falls into a [[coma]] the following season, his dreams include an encounter with Blundetto. In the dream, occurring in the season 6 episode 3 &quot;[[Mayham (The Sopranos episode)|Mayham]]&quot;, his cousin (named in the credits merely as &quot;Man&quot;) is stuck as a doorman in [[purgatory]], urging Soprano to let go of his life as a mobster and spend the rest of eternity with his dead loved ones. Specifically, Soprano arrives outside an Inn where a fancy dinner party is being held. He wants to go in and is invited inside by Blundetto, but is told that he will have to leave his briefcase outside. Soprano is reluctant to let go of the briefcase, since he says his &quot;whole life is in there.&quot; The implication is that he is on the verge of crossing over into the [[afterlife]] and must leave the briefcase, symbolizing his mortal life, behind. The presence of Blundetto, a man he murdered, and his [[Livia Soprano|dead mother]] inside the Inn, adds further credence to this idea.

=== Characterization and introduction ===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=&quot;I’ve always played people who are considerably younger, so it’s nice to be playing a grown-up. Bonnie is a grown-up. She’s a serious lady, man. Bonnie is very much navigating and delegating to the students. The students are the only people Bonnie and Frank can assert their power over and I think they’re enjoying that. Bonnie presents as more warm, but she does have an edge. I can relate to her.&quot;|source = — Actress Liza Weil on Bonnie's personality.&lt;ref name=buzzfeed&gt;{{cite web|last=Orley|first=Emily|date=September 17, 2014|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyorley/liza-weil-how-to-get-away-with-murder?utm_term=.dczAlWwwJ8#.wywGo8XXrP|title=The Actress Behind Paris Geller Is All Grown Up|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Early in the series, Bonnie was portrayed as a sweet and responsible adult.&lt;ref name=Pilot&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=[[How to Get Away with Murder]]|credits=Writer: [[Peter Nowalk|Nowalk, Peter]]. Director: Offer, Michael|season=1|airdate=September 25, 2014|network=[[American Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the course of the series, her personal life collapses, and Bonnie finds herself facing numerous problems. She was pressed by Annalise, who wanted her to work more and more, and was involved in a fateful relationship with Analise's intern Asher Millstone. Bonnie's portrayer, Liza Weil, said the character is a grown-up woman and Weil's first role as a &quot;serious lady.&quot;&lt;ref name=buzzfeed/&gt; Bonnie had a terrifying past; her father sexually abused her when she was a girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Meet Bonnie|series=How to Get Away with Murder|season=2|credits=Writer: Thompson, Sarah L..

In an interview with [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], series creator, Peter Nowalk, commented that on Season 3, &quot;Bonnie is going to have to choose sides, basically. Bonnie is like, Annalise, we can forgive Frank, it was Sam's fault! She's trying to be the peacemaker,&quot; he said, regarding the [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep30|season 2 finale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='How To Get Away With Murder': Viola Davis Shows Love For Castmate Liza Weil Before Season 3|url=http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/86255/20160606/how-to-get-away-with-murder-viola-davis-shows-love-castmate-liza-weil-before-season-3.htm|website=Fashion &amp; Style|accessdate=June 15, 2016|date=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero''', played by [[Vincent Pastore]], is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] [[television|TV]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Not to be confused with fellow [[New Jersey]] [[mobster]] [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Gennaro &quot;Little_Pussy&quot; Malanga|&quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga]], Big Pussy was one of the men who worked for [[Tony Soprano]] and the two were close friends.

==Biography==

{{Very long section|date=April 2015}} 

The son of Lino Bonpensiero,&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Allen &amp; David Chase. ''The Sopranos, A Family History.'' New York, American Library, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Salvatore Bonpensiero started out as a [[cat burglar]], and was affectionately known as &quot;Big Pussy&quot; because of this early career (&quot;Pussy&quot; in reference to a &quot;pussy cat&quot; since he was a cat burglar). It is also very likely that he started out solely with the nickname &quot;Pussy,&quot; then got the nickname &quot;Big Pussy&quot; to avoid confusion with [[Pussy Malanga|&quot;Little Pussy&quot; Malanga]]. The name confusion is referenced in the first episode when Tony's confidante Herman &quot;Hesh&quot; Rabkin mistakenly believes that Junior plans to whack Big Pussy. Tony corrected Hesh by saying that Junior planned to whack Little Pussy; that if Junior was to attempt an attack on Big Pussy that would result in an automatic mob war since Big Pussy was highly respected, even outside the DiMeo crime family and was also both made and a &quot;good earner.&quot; This showed in particular Bonpensiero's high status in the Soprano crew and his closeness to Tony, referring to him as &quot;''my'' Pussy.&quot; 

Big Pussy also ran an auto body shop with his brother [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Edward &quot;Duke&quot; Bonpensiero|Edward &quot;Duke&quot; Bonpensiero]]. He married his wife, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Angie Bonpensiero|Angela]] in 1976. He was an associate of [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#John Francis &quot;Johnny Boy&quot; Soprano|Johnny Boy Soprano]] during the 1960s alongside Paulie Gualtieri, until he supported Johnny during the unrest of 1983. Bonpensiero was [[made man|made]] sometime after this and acted as a soldier in the Soprano crew from then on. He remained loyal to the Soprano family and backed Johnny's wishes to have his son, [[Tony Soprano]], become [[caporegime|capo]] of the crew following Johnny's death in 1986. Bonpensiero worked alongside other longtime Soprano soldiers, [[Paulie Walnuts|Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri]] and [[Silvio Dante]]. Following the death of the elder Soprano, Bonpensiero also took on Johnny's tradition of dressing as [[Santa Claus]] and giving out presents to local children at [[Satriale's Pork Store]] at Christmas time.

Bonpensiero was a kind-hearted man who doted on his wife Angie and their three children, and was a long-time friend of Tony's. However, the money he made from the mob was not enough to raise his three children and put them through college, and he began [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] in [[heroin]] on the side. Soprano, his capo, and Jackie Aprile Sr., then acting boss, were aware of his sideline and urged him to stop dealing. Aprile had advised Big Pussy that if he were in need of money, Pussy could come to him.

It was around this time that he was caught by the [[FBI]] and given the choice of either working for them as an informant against Tony Soprano and his mob family or facing the possibility of 30 years imprisonment to [[life in prison]]. Given Bonpensiero's middle adulthood, even the concept of facing the minimum thirty years in jail would have been an effective [[life sentence]]. He agreed and was assigned FBI [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Skip Lipari|Agent Skip Lipari]] as a handler — he was revealed as an informant in the episode &quot;[[Do Not Resuscitate (The Sopranos episode)|Do Not Resuscitate]].&quot;

In various flashbacks to 1995, it is shown that Bonpensiero was instrumental in organizing a sit-down between high ranking captain, [[Junior Soprano]], and acting boss, [[Jackie Aprile Sr.|Jackie Aprile Senior]]. He traveled to [[Boca Raton]] to persuade Junior to return to [[New Jersey]] and settle a trucking dispute with Aprile. He was suspiciously late for the sitdown and blamed health problems with his [[Mistress (lover)|comare]]'s mother. He arrived to the Christmas celebrations that year already in his Santa suit and appearing drunk. He became angry when Gualtieri hugged him, quizzed Soprano about business, and almost got into a fight with Moltisanti. Soprano later remembered these events and decided Bonpensiero must have turned informant shortly before this. This conflicts with the episode &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;, when Agent Lapari said to Pussy &quot;you been with us (the FBI) since '98&quot;.

In 1999, Bonpensiero was an essential part of the Soprano crew's operation and was exposed to a number of things he could have reported. He intimidated a debtor into starting up [[Hesh Rabkin]] and Soprano's [[HMO]] insurance scam. He also helped [[Christopher Moltisanti|Moltisanti]] dispose of the body of [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family#Emil Kolar|Emil Kolar]]. As the crew's car expert, he was assigned to retrieve a car stolen from [[A.J. Soprano|Tony's son's]] teacher — he found the thieves and kidnapped them but the car had already been [[chop shop|chopped]]. He came up with a novel solution — steal a car of the same model and repaint it. He was present when Soprano and the other capos discussed their problems with new figurehead acting boss, Junior. When indictments were threatened, he fled and burned papers in his back garden, perhaps a sign that he was not co-operating fully.

Later that year, he was arrested at a card game run by Soprano family capo [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family#Jimmy Altieri|Jimmy Altieri]]. He tried to escape but threw his back out and was caught (he was later criticized for breaking the Mafia's policy against running from the authorities). He was quickly [[bail]]ed out, but was confined to his house. Shortly after, dirty cop [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the DiMeo Crime Family#Vin Makazian|Vin Makazian]] told Soprano he had a rat in his organization and pointed the finger at Bonpensiero. Soprano assigned Gualtieri to see if he could feel out where Bonpensiero's loyalties lay, by checking him for a [[wire tap|wire]], even authorizing him to kill his old friend if he saw one. Soprano was obviously distressed to have to ask Gualtieri to do this to a trusted member of the crew. However, his orders were cut-and-dried, that if Gaultieri did not see a wire, he was not to do the hit. Gualtieri then surprised Bonpensiero with a trip to a bath house, where he refused to undress and left, blaming high blood pressure. This behavior served to heighten his crew's suspicions, but meant Paulie had to abide by Tony's orders. After this experience, he disappeared. While he was away, Gualtieri took over his collections, and the crew killed Altieri, taking the heat off Bonpensiero as the crew figured Jimmy was the &quot;rat.&quot;

Bonpensiero resurfaced at Sopranos' home in 2000, claiming to have been in [[Puerto Rico]] receiving treatment for his bad back from an [[acupuncture|acupuncturist]]. When reporting to Lipari after the meeting, Bonpensiero lied about Soprano, showing a reluctance to give anything up. He was left out of the crew's trip to [[Italy]] to discuss exporting stolen cars with a local mafia family. While meeting Lipari in a distant party goods store, he was spotted by an [[Elvis impersonator]] and acquaintance named Jimmy Bones. Lipari reassured him that they had handled it well. However, Bonpensiero later went to Bones' house and murdered him for fear of being revealed. 

Since his return, he and his wife had been having trouble and she discussed leaving him with [[Carmela Soprano]], who dissuaded her because of their [[Catholicism]]. Angie settled for sleeping in separate bedrooms.

Upon his return from Italy, Soprano reorganized his crew — Gualtieri would be a capo now that Tony was acting boss, Dante would become Tony's consigliere, and new addition [[Furio Giunta]] would be on an equal footing with Bonpensiero despite his years of long service. Bonpensiero was distressed at the new order, openly hostile to Giunta, and complained to Lipari that &quot;this thing of ours&quot; turned into &quot;this thing of mine.&quot; His reservations about informing on Soprano began to dissipate.

Lipari persuaded Bonpensiero to wear a wire to A.J.'s confirmation, but he spent most of his time upstairs with A.J., telling him that his father would do anything for him instead of talking business. He ends the evening sobbing in the bathroom, still trapped in an impossible situation.

Following Moltisanti's shooting by associates [[Matthew Bevilaqua]] and [[Sean Gismonte]], Bonpensiero fell back into his loyal soldier role; he tracked down the escaped Bevilaqua, phoned Soprano, met him at Satriale's to tool up and took him to get the traitor. They drew out the murder, talking to the frightened upstart for a while before unloading their weapons into him. Soprano took Bonpensiero for dinner afterward, and it seemed to be just like old times. When Lipari called Bonpensiero, saying a witness to Bevilaqua's shooting identified Soprano and &quot;a second, husky figure,&quot; he flatly denied any involvement. Lipari chose to believe him, but pressured him to get a confession from Soprano on tape. The FBI's murder case fell apart when the witness withdrew his statement when he realized that he had implicated high-level Mafia figures. 

Bonpensiero eventually began to co-operate and gave Lipari information on Soprano's stolen airline ticket scam. Lipari said that Bonpensiero had a case of [[Stockholm syndrome]] when he suggested that he could work in law enforcement once he finished helping the FBI build their case. Lipari coldly said that Bonpensiero's future involved testifying against Tony Soprano and his friends, doing prison time for selling heroin, and then a life in the Witness Protection Program. Bonpensiero began recording notes and tailing members of his crew. He ended up in a car accident in an unrequested &quot;stake-out&quot; gone wrong.

Soprano eventually abandoned his blinding affection for Bonpensiero and realized his old friend's betrayal after a portentous dream where Bonpensiero appeared as a fish and told him that he had known all along. Soprano decided he had to be sure, so he visited Bonpensiero's home to search for evidence while Silvio distracted him. Soprano found a [[Covert listening device|wire]] in the false-bottom of a cigar box on his dresser. He then had Bonpensiero meet him on the pretense of checking out a new boat. Soprano, Dante and Gualtieri confronted their former friend once they got out to sea and got him to admit that he had informed on them. Bonpensiero claimed that he had been acting as a double agent to feed misinformation to the FBI. Soprano, Gualtieri, and Bonpensiero have some Tequila, and have one last toast to good times. Dante then came down into the cabin and Bonpensiero realized that he would not make it off the boat alive and requested to not be shot in the face. Paulie Walnuts told Bonpensiero, &quot;You were like a brother to me.&quot; Pussy requested to sit down, and then Soprano opened fire; Paulie and Silvio also shot Bonpensiero. They didn't hit him above the neck. Paulie then took his jewelry off and the three bagged him up, weighed him down and threw him overboard. All three have since been haunted by the memory of their old friend's betrayal and murder.

Bonpensiero was survived by his wife, Angie, and children, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Matt Bonpensiero|Matt]], [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Kevin Bonpensiero|Kevin]], and Terri. He is also survived by his illegitimate son, Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; LaRocca, as revealed in the videogame ''[[The Sopranos: Road to Respect]]''. Angie [[Inheritance|inherited]] the body shop, which she co-owns with Salvatore's younger brother Duke, and continued his involvement with the DiMeo Crime Family. Although Tony was at first hostile to Angie because he believed she was scamming Carmela for money, Carmela has seen Angie struggling and later sees her working at a grocery store, handing out free samples. Carmela's insistence changed Tony's attitude towards Angie, and he has referred much of his crew and other people to the Bonpensiero Body Shop.

'''Frank Booth''' is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[antagonist]] of [[David Lynch]]'s 1986 [[psychological thriller]] ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', portrayed by [[Dennis Hopper]].

Booth became one of the best-known villains in cinema. He ranks #36 on [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|list of the top 50 film villains of all time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFI&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.filmsite.org/afi100heroesvilla.html | title=AFI's 100 Heroes &amp; Villains |date=June 2003 | work=American Film Institute | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the film==
A [[Antisocial personality disorder|psychopathic]] [[gangster]], [[drug dealer]] and [[pimp]], Frank is the central figure of [[Lumberton, North Carolina]]'s criminal underworld. He kidnaps singer Dorothy Vallens' husband and son, holding them hostage to force Dorothy to satisfy his [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] sexual urges. When he is with Dorothy, he exhibits a kind of split personality: &quot;Daddy&quot;, a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] who beats and demeans her; and &quot;Baby&quot;, a child who ritualistically [[rape]]s her while begging her to gag him with a piece of blue velvet cloth. His sexual arousal is highlighted by fits of violent rage, enhanced by inhaling an unidentified gas from a tank.

Frank kills Dorothy's husband and cuts off his ear, which is found by college student Jeffrey Beaumont. While investigating the case, Jeffrey spies on Frank abusing Dorothy, and sees that Dorothy actually enjoys being brutalized. Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together days later and forces them to accompany him to the apartment of Suave Ben, his crony who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben lip-syncs a performance of [[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of &quot;In Dreams&quot;. He then beats Dorothy within an inch of her life, and dumps her, naked, on Jeffrey's lawn.

Jeffrey follows Frank to his hideout, where he finds the corpse of Dorothy's husband and the &quot;Yellow Man&quot; – Det. Tom Gordon, whom Frank has [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Jeffrey hides in the closet again, this time armed with a gun. Frank kills the Yellow Man and attacks Jeffrey, who shoots him in the head and kills him.

==Cultural impact==
Booth's lines and extensive use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; are frequently referenced in pop culture. The line, &quot;Don't you fucking look at me!&quot; was voted by ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'' as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Quotes in Cinema&quot;, and was sampled by electronic act [[Faultline (musician)|Faultline]] for use in the title track of the album ''Closer, Colder''. [[Industrial music|Industrial]] group [[Pigface]] sampled one of Booth's lines for use in the remix song &quot;Sick Asp Fuck.&quot; Samples of Frank speaking are strewn throughout [[Mr. Bungle]]'s [[Mr. Bungle (album)|self-titled album]]. Most notably, the track &quot;Squeeze me Macaroni&quot; samples Frank's lines &quot;Man, where's the fucking beer, man?&quot; and &quot;One thing I can't fucking stand is warm beer, makes me fucking puke!&quot;

When hosting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Dennis Hopper appeared in a skit as Frank Booth, hosting a game show titled &quot;What's That Smell?&quot;, which he opened with Booth's line &quot;Hello, neighbor.&quot;

In a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Prato, Greg. [http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-lynchs-first-solo-album-is-on-crazy-clown-time-20110817 &quot;David Lynch's First Solo Album is on 'Crazy Clown Time'&quot;] ''Rolling Stone''. August 18, 2011. Retrieved 2012-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; David Lynch was asked &quot;Who is a more dangerous gentleman, Frank Booth or [[Wild at Heart (film)|Marcellus Santos]]?&quot; and Lynch replied &quot;That's a good question. I'd rather hang with Frank Booth. I'd rather chill with him, and wait for a booty call, than with Marcellus.&quot;

*''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as #54 on its list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, calling him &quot;the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Premiere&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | date = | url = http://www.premiere.com/features/1539/the-100-greatest-movie-characters-of-all-time-page2.html | accessdate = 2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine placed Frank Booth as the 67th Greatest Film Character of all time.
*&quot;Don't you fucking look at me!&quot; was voted by ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'' as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Quotes in Cinema&quot;.

==Casting==
The part of Frank Booth was originally offered to [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]], who both turned it down. When Hopper read the script, he called director [[David Lynch]] and said, &quot;You have to let me play Frank! Because I am Frank!&quot;

[[Robert Loggia]] had expressed interest in playing the role of Frank Booth. He showed up for an audition, unaware that Dennis Hopper had already been cast, and proceeded to wait for three hours, growing increasingly agitated. Upon seeing Lynch and learning of Hopper's casting, Loggia launched into a profanity-laden rant, which remained in Lynch's head for years. Loggia, years later, received a phone call from Lynch requesting his performance for antagonist Mr. Eddy in his 1997 psychological thriller ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''. His tirade would  eventually become Mr. Eddy's road rage scene.

==Unexplained drug==
Throughout the film, Frank Booth uses a medical mask and tube to inhale some kind of stimulant from an [[aerosol]] canister. The identity of this gas is a subject of controversy. Lynch's script specified [[helium]], to raise Booth's voice and have it resemble that of an infant. However, during filming, Hopper, an experienced drug user, claimed to have insight into Booth's choice of drug, and said that helium was inappropriate. Lynch later explained the change:

{{cquote|I'm thankful to Dennis, because up until the last minute it was gonna be helium &amp;mdash; to make the difference between 'Daddy' and the baby that much more. But I didn't want it to be funny. So helium went out the window and became just a gas. Then, in the first rehearsal, Dennis said, 'David, I know what's in these different canisters.' And I said, 'Thank God, Dennis, that you know that!' And he named all the gases.}}

In a documentary on the 2002 Special edition [[DVD]] version of the film, Hopper claims the drug was [[amyl nitrite]], an [[angina]] medication used recreationally as an [[inhalant]] in the [[disco]] club scene.

== Appearances ==
In the original ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', Jess is a sorority member of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sig. Jess, along with her sorority sisters, began to receive disturbing phone calls from an disorientated man. During a Christmas party, Jess receives another obscene phone call and lets Barb, Phyl, Clare and several other girls to listen to the incoherent ramblings of the disturbed caller, who does several different voices within each call he makes. The next day, Jess meets with her boyfriend, Peter, to tell him that she is pregnant and getting an [[abortion]] which causes him to get upset. Jess later attends a search party to help find a missing girl. After the girl's corpse is found, Jess heads home and receives another phone call. She calls the police and, unaware that Peter is in the house until he startles her and argues with her. He leaves as the police come and tap the phone. She manages to keep the caller on the phone long enough for the police to trace the call and they tell her the man is calling from inside the house. 

Jess calls for Phyl and Barb and grabs a fireplace poker and goes upstairs. She discovers the corpses of her friends and then sees the eyes of the caller who reveals himself as Billy looking at her through the door crack, telling her not to &quot;tell what we did, Agnes...&quot; before she slams the door on him. He then chases her downstairs and grabs her hair as she tries to unlock the front door. Jess manages to escape, fleeing to the basement with a fire poker for protection. 

She locks the door just as Billy starts to bang on the door in rage. As Jess wanders the basement, she sees Peter looking into the window, and Jess kills him, believing him to be the killer. The police then hear her screams. They sedate Jess and unknowingly leave her in the house with the real killer, Billy, who is in the attic. Her fate is left ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classic-horror.com/reviews/black_christmas_1974|title=Black Christmas (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=Classic-Horror.com|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horrorfreaknews.com/black-christmas-1974-review|title=Black Christmas (1974) Review|last=|first=|date=|website=Horror Freak News|publisher=|access-date=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2009/12/17/black-christmas/|title=Black Christmas (1974)|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinemassacre Productions|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jess appears as the main character in the novelization of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terapeak.com/worth/black-christmas-movie-tie-in-novelization-paperback-with-olivia-hussey-cover/251227628123/|title=Black Christmas Movie Tie-in Novelization|last=|first=|date=|website=terrapeak.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly after the release of the [[Black Christmas (2006 film)|2006 reboot]], [[Bob Clark]] began to work on a direct sequel to the original film. [[Olivia Hussey]] was set to reprise her role as Jess. In this film, Jess would have been the new house mother of the sorority house. The film was eventually abandoned after the untimely death of Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/10860|title=BLACK CHRISTMAS 2' After 27 Years' Really'|last=|first=|date=November 26, 2001|website=Ain't It Cool News|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In ''The Mammoth Book of Slasher Movies'', Peter Normanton praised the importance that Jess has on the film saying &quot;Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) has to confront a dilemma in her own life, one that will have a major bearing on the outcome of this film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mammoth Book of Slasher Movies|last=Normanton|first=Peter|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|year=2012|isbn=1780330413|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Fright Xmas,'' Alan-Bertaneisson Jones stated that the plot of ''Black Christmas'' did not focus on the killer but rather on Jess and the other girls from the film, saying that &quot;This is quite refreshing, because unlike in later movies where the victims (especially the female ones) are just a line of meat to feed to the grinder, in this film Jessica is a much more fully realized character; a character with great courage, intelligence and strength (more akin to Laurie from ''Halloween,'' Ripley from the ''Alien'' movies or Sidney from the ''Scream'' movies than most female victims of slashers, perhaps especially in the 1980s).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fright Xmas|last=Jones|first=Alan-Bertaneisson|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2010|isbn=1452061998|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen'', Richard Crouse praised Olivia's performance saying &quot;Hussey brings a quiet strength to Jess that hints at a fountain of inner resolve.&quot; and noted the complexity around her character stating that &quot;In ''Black Christmas'' Jess rebels against her boyfriend, planning to have an abortion. Clearly she is no virgin, and yet she is the sole survivor of Billy's rampage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Son of the 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen|last=Crouse|first=Richard|publisher=ECW Press|year=2010|isbn=1554903300|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheryl Nicolette Tenbury-Newent''' (also '''Brady''')  is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Bronagh Waugh]]. The character first appeared on-screen on 25 November 2008, during the [[Hollyoaks Later (series 1)|first series]] of the ''Hollyoaks'' spin-off, ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'', as the former love interest of [[Malachy Fisher]]. She made her first appearance in main ''Hollyoaks'' episodes in July 2009, introduced to the serial by series producer, [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]]. In 2010 when [[Paul Marquess]] began producing the serial, he felt that Cheryl was being used in the wrong way, subsequently making her a central character to the show. It was announced on 1 February 2013 that Waugh quit her role. Cheryl departed ''Hollyoaks'' on 22 March 2013, after three and half years on the show.

==Character creation==

===Background===
The character of Cheryl was created to help correctly show a cross-section of young people in British society.&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/liverpool-lifestyle/2009/07/22/hollyoaks-actress-bronagh-waugh-i-m-standing-up-for-ordinary-girls-100252-24211478/#|title=Hollyoaks actress Bronagh Waugh: I'm standing up for ordinary girls|publisher=The Liverpool Echo|author=Collinson, Dawn|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl was given immediate links to [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]), being his ex-girlfriend and [[Kris Fisher]] ([[Gerard McCarthy]]) who also knew her from his time living in Belfast. When Cheryl was introduced to the main cast she had already established links with character [[Zak Ramsey]] ([[Kent Riley]]), who she had previously shared a fling with. Series producer Lucy Allan also stated she had big plans for the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;/&gt; Bronagh Waugh and [[Ricky Whittle]] ([[Calvin Valentine]]) discussed why they believed the character was introduced into the main series stating: &quot;I think they brought me in to lighten it [Hollyoaks] up.&quot; and &quot;They have brought Cheryl in to introduce a bit of comedy, a bit more fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lw&quot;/&gt;

===Casting===
Actress Bronagh Waugh received a call to audition for the part of Cheryl in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; At first Waugh thought it was a mistake because she did not see herself fitting in with the typical stereotype of the female cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; Waugh went on to get the part, which was initially a short term stint in spin-off series, ''Hollyoaks Later''. After Waugh had impressed series producer Lucy Allan, Waugh was called back and offered a one-year contract to appear in the main series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ds&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a142154/new-oaks-producer-signs-two-sexy-regulars.html|title=Soaps - News - New 'Oaks producer signs two sexy regulars|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On hearing the news Waugh jumped up and down screaming, claiming she didn't think she would get the call back.&lt;ref name=&quot;atc&quot;/&gt; Initially the casting department were looking for an actress that weighed far more, but couldn't find anyone and decided to find someone of normal size with curves.&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; Of the part she said: &quot;I think it's good to see someone with flaws. I feel an enormous responsibility to younger viewers who may be watching and going 'oh my God, the girls in ''Hollyoaks'' are so skinny and gorgeous' and I really want to stand up for ordinary girls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; Waugh also credited actor Gerard McCarthy who plays Kris Fisher in the series for helping her secure the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/bronaghrsquos-hot-dates-14384929.html|title=Bronagh's hot dates - Sunday Life|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=5 July 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Waugh announced she was staying with ''Hollyoaks'' until at least April 2011 after signing an 18-month contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a195912/oaks-star-waugh-on-18-month-deal.html|title='Oaks star Waugh on '18-month deal'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to ''PA'', Waugh explained: &quot;It is quite long actually. Most people are six months or a year. But I'm glad they've let me know longer term because at least you're not going 'Should I look for another job?'. I can really put my head down and concentrate and enjoy the next couple of years.&quot; She also admitted she was &quot;happy&quot; to stick with the show for another two years, but believes it will be &quot;time to go&quot; after that. She continued: &quot;It's such a big character that I wouldn't want to get pigeon-holed in just that type of thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deal&quot;/&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
Cheryl has an outlandish personality, she is loud and a larger than life character, speaking on in conjunction with this series producer Lucy Allan made a comment stating &quot;You can't have anything but big with Cheryl, can you?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a156720/plot-teasers-from-new-oaks-producer.html|title=Hollyoaks - Soap Scoop - Plot teasers from new 'Oaks producer|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waugh has also has compared her to a popular cartoon character stating: &quot;She's like the Tasmanian devil, just a whirlwind hurricane leaving carnage in her wake and then totters off as if that's completely normal and goes and buys a loaf of bread.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a164364/oaks-bronagh-cheryl-like-tasmanian-devil.html|title=Soaps - News - 'Oaks' Bronagh: 'Cheryl like Tasmanian devil'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Green, Kris|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also spoke about her character's softer side stating: &quot;She's like a bulldozer, she just storms in and goes nuts, and she's a real maneater. But at the same time what I love is that they let me show her vulnerability. If you're a big two-dimensional comedy character, it's good fun for a couple of weeks but then that's it. I think someone who's as brash and brazen as her needs to show a flip-side, there's a reason why she acts the way she does and we get to see that too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; The official ''[[E4 (channel)|E4]]'' publicity describes her as 'the bubbly tart with a heart’ and states that she spells out trouble for the males and causes a ruckus for the females.&lt;ref name=&quot;cb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/cast/girls/cherylbrady.html|title=Hollyoaks - Cheryl Brady (played by Bronagh Waugh)|work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]]|publisher=([[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television Corporation]])|date=June 2009|accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview on loose Women Waugh spoke about her character stating: &quot;I play the maneater of the village that tries to get them all but it doesn't really work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lw&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Bronagh Waugh, Ricky Whittle, Sherie Hewson, Jane McDonald|date=29 July 2009|title=Loose Women|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIIkHEeBFYw|format=FLV|medium=Television production|publisher=[[ITV plc|ITV]]|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheryl is often seen in many outlandish outfits consisting of hot pants and items of many bright colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;clothes&quot;/&gt; Waugh was stated that she doesn't mind the outfits because they remain true to her larger-than-life personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;clothes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a201570/waugh-unfazed-over-hollyoaks-wardrobe.html|title=Waugh unfazed over 'Hollyoaks' wardrobe|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|author=Kilkelly, Daniel|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that Cheryl has a lot of confidence in order to dress the way she does.&lt;ref name=&quot;clothes&quot;/&gt;

===Malachy Fisher===
Cheryl's only long term relationship with a fellow character was with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), their relationship happened off-screen. The characters have often been shown recalling how good they were together, although it was Malachy who left her. She has shown a keen interest in a strew on male characters since her first appearance but always seems to be unlucky in love. Speaking of Malachy and other men Waugh spoke about their special connection saying:&quot;I think Cheryl is kinda after everyone, she'll be eternally after Malachy he'll always hold a very special place in his heart for her, shes after a lot of other boys, but I think there will always be a connection between Malachy and Cheryl throughout all the time they stay on the show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atc&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Bronagh Waugh, Ricky Whittle|date=2 July 2009|title=Hollyoaks: Ask The Cast|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIIkHEeBFYw|format=FLV|medium=Internet Broadcast|publisher=Lime Pictures|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later paired with the character [[Gilly Roach]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]) for a few months, but their relationship was ruined after Cheryl found out he was actually in love with [[Steph Cunningham]] ([[Carley Stenson]]).

===Departure===
On 1 February 2013, it was announced that Waugh had decided to leave ''Hollyoaks''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaving&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a455764/hollyoaks-bronagh-waugh-leaving-cheryl-brady-role.html|title='Hollyoaks': Bronagh Waugh leaving Cheryl Brady role|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 February 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last scenes as Cheryl will air in March and will see her depart during the same week as [[Emmett Scanlan]], who plays Cheryl's brother [[Brendan Brady|Brendan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaving&quot;/&gt; Of her decision to leave, Waugh stated &quot;Deciding to leave ''Hollyoaks'' was tough - I have had the most incredible four years on the show and the cast and crew really are like my family - but it just feels like the right time for me and for Cheryl.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaving&quot;/&gt; Waugh revealed that she was keen to pursue new acting role in Ireland and the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaving&quot;/&gt; [[Digital Spy]]'s Daniel Kilkelly reported that Cheryl and Brendan's departures will occur during an &quot;explosive week&quot; of ''Hollyoaks''.

==Storylines==

Cheryl first appeared in Hollyoaks Later when Malachy and Kris returned home for their father's funeral. She then continually clashed with Malachy's fiancée [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]). She eventually convinced Malachy to go ahead with the wedding despite her still present feelings for him. She had a brief fling at this time with Zak, but she appeared too keen on him and scared him off.

She first appeared in the Hollyoaks village in the back of a taxi and visited Malachy at the McQueen's, claiming she was looking for Zak Ramsey, whom she had shared a kiss with. On learning Zak was attending the funeral of [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]), she and Malachy went to find him. [[Michaela McQueen]] ([[Hollie-Jay Bowes]]) displayed her dislike for Cheryl and was jealous. [[Sasha Valentine]] ([[Nathalie Emmanuel]]) ordered a noisy Cheryl to leave the church and, on her exit, she walked into Mercedes. The pair ended up in a fight and were restrained by Calvin and Malachy. Cheryl revealed to Malachy and Kris that the reason she is in Hollyoaks village was because a man had died whilst having sex with her and she was scared the police might arrest her, however Kris later informed her that the police were not looking for her. Steph gave Cheryl a job at MOBs and she moved into the Halls. Cheryl began looking after [[Spencer Gray (Hollyoaks)|Spencer Gray]] ([[Darren John Langford]]) in an attempt to get closer to Calvin, but showed genuine guilt when she allowed Calvin to refer Spencer to a care home as he couldn't cope with him. Cheryl moved in with the Valentines when she got kicked out of halls and struck up friendship with [[Leo Valentine]] ([[Brian Bovell]]). Cheryl remained living with the family, despite Calvin's reluctance, until Sasha returned and demanded Cheryl move out. Leo and Calvin ask Cheryl to leave, but she eventually proved herself by persuading Malachy and Mercedes not to sue Spencer for Malchy's accident on the building site.

In order to make Calvin jealous Cheryl kissed Gilly, who was trying to make Steph jealous. However, things do not go to plan when his false tooth falls out in her mouth. Cheryl began to realise she had feelings for Gilly. When Calvin insulted him, she told him she loves him, and is not using him. Cheryl sees Gilly holding an engagement ring, which [[Fernando Fernandez (Hollyoaks)|Fernando Fernandez]] (Jeronimo Best) plans to give to Steph. Cheryl immediately assumes Gilly is planning to propose and announces their engagement. Gilly is horrified to find himself engaged and tries to act like a slob to put Cheryl off of marrying him. However, this does not work. When Gilly accuses her of having an affair with [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]), she dumps him. Gilly realises he does love Cheryl so he proposes for real, which she accepts. Cheryl finds out Gilly has feelings for Steph and she ends their relationship.

Gilly goes travelling however cuts his holiday short when he meets Jem and gets engaged again which upsets Cheryl. When Calvin is shot dead by [[Theresa McQueen]] ([[Jorgie Porter]]) at his wedding with [[Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]), Cheryl tells a grieving Carmel that Calvin had been having an affair with Carmel's sister Mercedes. Cheryl later tells the police that she believes Mercedes is involved in Calvin's death, Malachy tells the police it was him. Cheryl wins £250,000 on the lottery. After her lottery win Cheryl's brother [[Brenden Brady]] (Emmett Scanlan) turns up and convinces her to buy The Loft, which she renames 'Chez Chez'. Cheryl's best friend Lynsey also arrives in the village.

Cheryl's old mate [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) turns up, and Cheryl is delighted to see her. Cheryl informs her she fancies Malachy, and Lynsey is too afraid to admit she does too. Malachy also fancies Lynsey, so in an attempt to not hurt Cheryl's feelings, the pair agree to keep their affair private. Cheryl sets employees Rhys and Jacqui up on a date, convinced they're in love and hoping to create a new relationship.

Cheryl's brother Brendan gets up to bad business in Hollyoaks, dealing with drugs to raise money and often stealing from Cheryl. However, Cheryl is completely unaware of his dodgy side and thinks Brendan is an &quot;angel&quot;. Cheryl get mugged accidentally by Brendan who didn't think it was her. Malachy tells Cheryl that her brother was the one who attacked him - however Cheryl is repulsed at how he could think that, and fires him and throws him out of the house. After emerging from hospital, Cheryl finally meets her &quot;silent partner&quot; [[Danny Houston]] ([[Darren Day]]). However, she is unimpressed and picks up that he is dodgy, and realises this is not the guy she wants to share her business with. She also discovers Rhys and Jacqui are no longer an item, and is not happy. Cheryl is heartbroken when she finds out Lynsey and Malachy are seeing each other behind her back. Cheryl also struggles to cope with Steph dying of cancer.

Cheryl and Lynsey make up when Malachy gets back with Mercedes during a night out they come back to find the village destroyed, Malachy in hospital and Steph dead (leaving Cheryl devastated).

She is unaware that Silas Blissett, has swapped the slimming pills for sedatives and she ends up in hospital. Brendan returns and buys Cheryl's share of Chez Chez.

Cheryl feels especially guilty when Lynsey's claims that [[Silas Blissett]] ([[Jeff Rawle]]) is actually a serial killer, having murdered [[India Longford]] ([[Beth Kingston]]), [[Rae Wilson]], Rebeccah Massey, are true and that Silas has been charged with the killings. Silas' evil side is discovered when he accidentally murdered his daughter [[Heidi Costello]] ([[Kim Tiddy]]), intending to kill Lynsey instead, who was wearing the same costume as them on [[Halloween]]. Cheryl resents herself as she threw the party at Chez-Chez that Heidi attended, before leaving and being mistaken for Lynsey by Silas, and strangled. Lynsey rejects Cheryl's constant apologises, saying that she was her best friend, and she wasn't there when she needed her. Cheryl is glad that, now Silas has been proved to be the killer, it proves that Brendan is innocent and can return home from prison.

'''Luca Brasi''' is a fictional character in [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', as well as its [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. In the film, he was portrayed by [[Lenny Montana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ex-wrestler&lt;ref name=II&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the gangsters still love The Godfather of all movies|date=April 13, 2001|url=http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/why-the-gangsters-still-love-the-godfather-of-all-movies-26089900.html|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ex-bodyguard for the [[Colombo crime family]].

== Plot details==

Luca Brasi is [[Mafia boss]] [[Vito Corleone]]'s personal enforcer. Brasi has a reputation as a savage killer, making him one of the most feared and dangerous criminals in the [[American Mafia]].  Vito is the only person who can control Brasi, but he also fears him and becomes nervous whenever they meet.

Brasi can perform any job or murder without accomplices that could implicate him. He also eliminates witnesses, making a criminal conviction nearly impossible. In one two-week killing spree, he murders six men who attempted to assassinate Don Corleone. Only Vito, recuperating from the attack, could call him off. These six deaths end the famous &quot;Olive Oil War.&quot; Brasi's fanatical loyalty to Don Corleone is unquestioned, and he is said to have killed a Corleone [[soldato|soldier]] merely for making the Corleone family look bad. Brasi often claims he would sooner kill himself than betray the Godfather.

Another early incident involved Brasi killing two of [[Al Capone]]'s henchmen who were hired to murder Don Corleone. Brasi subdues both men, binding and then gagging them with towels. As Brasi hacks up one with an ax, the other man, terrified, chokes to death on the towel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Puzo |first=Mario |authorlink=Mario Puzo |year=1969 |title=[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]] |isbn=0-7493-2468-6 |pages=214–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the novel, Vito's youngest son, [[Michael Corleone]], learns that years earlier Brasi murdered an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[prostitute]] hours after she bore his child. He then forced the [[midwife]], under threat of death, to hurl the live infant into a burning furnace. The distraught woman, who described Brasi as an unholy [[demon]], sought Vito's protection. Don Corleone intervened, covering up Brasi's crime and earning Brasi's undying service and loyalty.

Brasi is honored and grateful to be invited to Vito Corleone's home on the day of his daughter's wedding. To show proper respect, Brasi personally presents the Don a large cash gift for his daughter, Connie's, bridal purse, purportedly the largest sum given. During the reception, Michael's girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], notices Brasi and asks Michael about him. He tells her how his father once helped his godson [[Johnny Fontane]]'s career with Brasi's assistance. Don Corleone had offered bandleader Les Halley $10,000 to release Fontane from a personal service contract that unfairly exploited Fontane's rising fame. When Halley refused, Don Corleone returned the next day with Luca Brasi to make Halley an &quot;offer he couldn't refuse.&quot;  Within an hour Halley signed a release for only $1,000.&lt;ref name=TAG&gt;{{cite book|title=The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay|first=Jenny M.|last=Jones|date=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffvkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT99&amp;lpg=PT99&amp;dq=godfather+release+band+leader+one+thousand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S6XvnSv-Pf&amp;sig=g0eX3QYBCiAFdiIJJPQkMdT8QC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w7M-VY6yCsScsAW-_YDADQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=godfather%20release%20band%20leader%20one%20thousand&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Brasi held a gun to Halley's head, Don Corleone assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the contract.&lt;ref name=TAG/&gt; In the novel, the circumstances and tendered amount differs somewhat. Accompanied by Brasi, Vito Corleone held Halley at gunpoint after initially offering the bandleader $10,000. The Don then paid $1,000 after forcing Halley to sign the release.

To draw out rival mobster [[Virgil Sollozzo]], Don Corleone orders Brasi to pretend he is switching allegiances. Brasi hangs out at [[Bruno Tattaglia]]'s nightclub, beds a waitress working there, and openly complains that he is underpaid. When that information filters back to Tattaglia, he offers Brasi a meeting. Brasi arrives, wearing a bulletproof vest. Sollozzo, after promising friendship, a job, and $50,000, has him subdued and garroted to death.  Sonny Corleone, Tom Hagen, and others in the family learn of Brasi's demise by receiving dead fish wrapped in Brasi's bulletproof vest, indicating he &quot;sleeps with the fishes&quot;.

Brasi's role as personal enforcer/bodyguard to the Don is later filled by [[Al Neri]]. Following Neri's initiation, Corleone family ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]] tells Michael that now he has his &quot;Luca&quot;.

Luca Brasi plays a major role in the prequel novel ''[[The Family Corleone]]'' by [[Edward Falco|Ed Falco]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Luca Brasi is the leader of a small but feared gang, which makes deals with Vito´s oldest son [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]. The younger Brasi is described as a [[psychopath]] who kills his own newborn child by having it thrown alive into a burning furnace, lets his Irish-American girlfriend Kelly die, and abuses drugs. Brasi also wants to kill Hagen for having an affair with Kelly. Brasi suffers a [[drug overdose]], which leads to a mental breakdown and stroke-like behavior. Although Vito dislikes and fears Brasi, he recruits him into his crime family, knowing that Brasi's formidable reputation would intimidate the Corleone family's enemies. 
Luca Brasi appears early on in ''[[The Godfather: The Game]]''. Vito tells Brasi to rescue the protagonist, [[Aldo Trapani]], from a brutal gang and train him. Brasi functions as a &quot;trainer&quot; for the player, demonstrating how to perform various game functions, such as shooting and punching. The player witnesses Brasi's eventual death and must escape to inform the family.

Brasi is also mentioned by Michael Corleone in [[The Godfather II (video game)|the video game version of ''The Godfather Part II'']], where the player, Dominic Corleone, acquires Brasi's old apartment.

Brasi inspired [[Baton Rouge]] rapper [[Kevin Gates]] to create his 2013 mixtape, ''The Luca Brasi Story'', and its sequel, ''Luca Brasi 2'', hosted by [[DJ Drama]] and released on December 15, 2014.

Luca Brasi features in the lyrics to [[Catatonia (band)|Catatonia]]'s song &quot;I am the Mob&quot; on their 1998 album ''[[International Velvet (album)|International Velvet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Metrolyrics]]|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-am-the-mob-lyrics-catatonia.html|title=I am the Mob lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luca Brasi is also the name of an Australian punk rock band from Tasmania. Luca Brasi have released three albums on Poison City Records, &quot;Extended Family&quot;, &quot;By A Thread&quot; and &quot;If This Is All We're Going To Be.&quot;

Luca Brasi is also referenced in [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]]'s song &quot;Luca&quot; on their 2006 album &quot;[[The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luca Lyrics|website=Genius.com|url=http://genius.com/Brand-new-luca-lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casey Braxton''' is a fictional character from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Lincoln Younes]]. Casey made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2011. Younes was about to go travelling when he auditioned for the role of Casey. He changed his plans upon winning the role. In late 2010 the Seven Network began airing trailers for a new trio of characters known as &quot;The River Boys&quot;. The trio consist of Casey and his older half-brothers [[Darryl Braxton|Darryl]] ([[Steve Peacocke]]) and [[Heath Braxton]] ([[Daniel Ewing (actor)|Dan Ewing]]). The River Boys arrive in [[Summer Bay]] from neighbouring town [[Mangrove River]]. Casey is characterised as being a &quot;modern day ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''&quot;; who is intelligent and unsure about what he wants out of life. Younes has described him as the &quot;epitome of teenage angst&quot;. The River Boys cause trouble in Summer Bay and producers were inspired by Koby Abberton's [[Bra Boys]] in the creation process. Casey is portrayed as wanting to distance himself from their bad reputation; but his anger issues often mar his attempts.

Casey is the first of the Braxton brothers to build friendships with established characters. He also begins a relationship with [[Ruby Buckton]] ([[Rebecca Breeds]]). Younes was later required for filming of the television series ''[[Tangle (TV series)|Tangle]]''; producers then devised an exit storyline to accommodate his temporary departure. The storyline consists of Casey succumbing to the bad reputation of the River Boys when he commits an arson attack against an adversary of the Braxton's. Casey was sentenced to time in juvenile detention and was given early release upon his return to the series. Casey and the rest of the River Boys have been well received by viewers. Critics also welcomed their inclusion in the series. Series producer Lucy Addario said that the response from fans had been &quot;utterly overwhelming&quot;. However, Bree Hoskin of [[Gaydar Radio]] felt that Casey has been overshadowed by his brothers and a poll ran by ''[[Inside Soap]]'' indicated that Casey was not as popular as Darryl. Younes announced his intentions to leave ''Home and Away'' in March 2014 and Casey made his final appearance on 16 September 2014.

==Creation and casting==
In 2010, [[Network Seven]] began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as The River Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sunday-telegraph/bay-surf-gang-making-waves/story-e6frewt9-1225983762243|title=Bay surf gang making waves|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|date=9 January 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said to be a &quot;bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations&quot;, The River Boys consist of three brothers – Darryl, Casey and Heath.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;/&gt; Kristy Kelly of [[Digital Spy]] reported Koby Abberton's [[Bra Boys]] were the inspiration for The River Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a305999/real-river-boy-discusses-ha-gang.html|title='Real River Boy' discusses 'H&amp;A' gang|last=Kelly|first=Kristy|date=25 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braxton brothers made their on screen debuts in February 2011.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

Younes had been starring in the television series ''[[Tangle (TV series)|Tangle]]''; after which he felt depressed and received no auditions.

==Character development==

===Characterisation===
[[File:Steve Peacocke and Dan Ewing.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Steve Peacocke and Dan Ewing (''pictured left to right'') play Brax and Heath, who create a bad reputation for the Braxtons.]]
{{cquote|Baby-faced Braxton brother Casey has grown up as something of an outsider: at home he's overshadowed by his older brothers, surfing legend Brax and bad boy Heath; at school he's floundered academically and socially, at best facing trouble with the teachers and, at worst, expulsion from Reefton Lakes High. Dig a little deeper, though, and Casey is an intelligent teen who, although uncertain about what he does want from life, is in no doubt about what he doesn't.|4=''[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on Casey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Casey Braxton|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/home-and-away/characters/casey-braxton|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Casey is the youngest of the Braxton brothers. ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' said that Casey is trying to break out of the River Boys mould and that he was kicked out of his last high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;/&gt; Casey is described as being a &quot;modern day ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/8732150/casey-braxton/|title=Casey Braxton|work=Home and Away|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has never quite fitted in and he does not know what he wants from life. He has been overshadowed by both of his brothers and he has struggled at school.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;/&gt; He was expelled from Reefton Lakes High for disruptive behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;/&gt; However, Casey is intelligent and has resisted becoming a typical River Boy, instead he is a loner.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;/&gt; Channel Seven said &quot;When Casey eventually makes friends at Summer Bay High his true personality shines through, revealing a courageous, sensitive, mischievous guy, with a sly, laconic wit. However, acceptance at Summer Bay can be seen as betrayal in Mangrove River, putting Casey in conflict with some of his brother's River Boy mates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;/&gt; Casey's mother leaves him to his own devices and he misinterprets that as disapproval from her.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaseySeven&quot;/&gt; [[Holy Soap]] questioned whether a new life Summer Bay could be Casey's chance to turn his life around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/homeandaway/news/meet-the-river-boys-12265 |title=More about the River Boys |date=8 February 2011 |work=[[Holy Soap]] |publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] |accessdate=15 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213072243/http://holysoap.five.tv:80/homeandaway/news/meet-the-river-boys-12265 |archivedate=13 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younes told Melinda Houston of ''[[The Age]]'' that Casey has come from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;. Casey wants to &quot;establish himself on the straight and narrow&quot;, while his brothers show little interest in following his example.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; Casey finds it hard to shake off the Braxtons' bad reputation and distance himself from his brothers.&lt;ref name=alicia/&gt; Although; Younes has opined that Casey does try to &quot;break out of the mould set by his older brothers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Younes (as Casey Braxton)|url=http://www.tv3.co.nz/Lincoln-Younes-as-Casey-Braxton/tabid/1288/articleID/71893/Default.aspx|work=[[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey is a mixed up young man; Younes said that portraying Casey's confusion &quot;screwed&quot; with his head because he had previously been in a similar situation.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; Casey was the first of the Braxton brothers to befriend some of the locals of Summer Bay. He forges friendships with [[Ruby Buckton]] ([[Rebecca Breeds]]), [[Xavier Austin]] ([[David Jones-Roberts]]) and [[Dexter Walker]] ([[Charles Cottier]]). Casey is also the first to display &quot;softer emotions&quot;; which often surface when he shares scenes with Ruby, who becomes Casey's love interest.&lt;ref name=bigone&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln: Casey is no bad boy|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/home-and-away/interviews/lincoln-casey-is-no-bad-boy|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younes told a reporter from [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] that Casey is not a &quot;bad boy&quot; role. Younes was attracted to the part of Casey because he is &quot;a product of his two older brothers and their clashing personalities&quot;.&lt;ref name=bigone/&gt; He has both sensitive and volatile sides to his persona. Younes explained that as the &quot;epitome of teenage angst&quot;, Casey does not have any idea of who he is. He does not know how to act around others and can be impressionable. Casey also has deep rooted issues with his anger; Younes said that he empathised with the way Casey feels due to his previous experiences.&lt;ref name=bigone/&gt;

===Relationship with Ruby Buckton===
In January 2011, Breeds told Debbie Schipp of ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'' that the River Boys added a new dynamic to the series. She revealed that Ruby would soon end up in a &quot;love-hate relationship&quot; with Casey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|title=New faces in a breed of their own|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ipad/new-faces-in-a-breed-of-their-own/story-fn6ci13q-1225992843379|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Younes told Alicia McCumstie of the ''Central Coast Express Advocate'' that Casey would get &quot;more action&quot; on the female front.&lt;ref name=alicia&gt;{{cite web|last=McCumstie|first=Alicia|title=Home and Away teenager all set to get hearts racing|url=http://express-advocate-wyong.whereilive.com.au/news/story/home-and-away-teenager-all-set-to-get-hearts-racing/|work=Central Coast Express Advocate|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that Casey was to have a fling with Ruby, after her romance with [[Romeo Smith]] ([[Luke Mitchell]]) ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;RubyCasey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a304777/ruby-casey-to-hook-up-on-home-and-away.html|title=Ruby, Casey to hook up on 'Home and Away'?|last=Rainey|first=Naomi|date=19 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ruby realises that Romeo is back with his girlfriend, she sleeps with Casey.

Anderson told ''[[TV Week]]'' that Charlie thinks Ruby is getting into a new relationship &quot;too quickly&quot;. Brax offers Charlie parenting advice about Ruby's relationships; Anderson said that Charlie listens to the advice yet refuses to admit that Brax is correct.&lt;ref name=eggfe&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='H&amp;A' star: 'Charlie struggles with Ruby'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a310725/ha-star-charlie-struggles-with-ruby.html|work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=24 March 2011|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arson and temporary departure===
[[File:Lincoln Younes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lincoln Younes (''pictured'') left ''Home and Away'' temporarily to film for the television series ''[[Tangle (TV series)|Tangle]]''.]]
In August 2011, it was announced that Younes would temporarily leave ''Home and Away''; while he returned to film his part in the television series ''Tangle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadly storm to hit Summer Bay|url=http://tv.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?ucsort=4&amp;cp-documentid=158811462|work=[[MSN]]|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ewing revealed that the serial had developed a storyline to compensate Younes' departure.&lt;ref name=ewing/&gt; His exit storyline begins after the Braxton's feud with the Pivoric family heightens. Casey goes to [[Jake Pirovic]]'s ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) headquarters and sets fire to the building. Younes told ''[[TV Week]]'' that Casey commits arson to stop tension between the two gangs, but just makes the situation worse.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Casey realises the ramifications of his actions and acknowledges that he did not want to turn out like his siblings. Younes said that Casey's &quot;whole demeanour and mood changed because he knows what he's done&quot;. Casey &quot;established himself as a River Boy&quot; through his act, Younes opined that it &quot;goes against everything he's been fighting for, as he's always tried not to be a River Boy.&quot;&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|title=Paying the price|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=24–30 September 2011|pages=6, 7|issue=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, Casey's relationship with Ruby is tested. Ruby betrays her sister and informs Casey that the police know that he committed the crime. Younes said that it &quot;stretched their relationship quite a bit&quot; because he places a lot of responsibility on Ruby; who has to keep his secret. Casey acts &quot;unfairly&quot; because he does not know what to do about the situation either. Heath tries to convince him to run from the law.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Younes told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that &quot;Brax is afraid for Casey&quot; because he knows the police will use the long arm of the law when they catch him. Brax makes Casey realise that he should hand himself over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Casey arrested!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=12–18 November 2011|issue=45|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Younes observed Casey to be the most &quot;emotional and volatile&quot; of the Braxton brothers, adding that Casey &quot;breaking down&quot; is a rarity. So when Casey breaks down in front of Brax, it becomes clear that Casey is remorseful for his actions. Brax realises that Casey is &quot;in too deep&quot; and feels &quot;scared&quot; for his future. When Casey hands himself in to the police it changes his attitude. He remains afraid but loses his emotions and feelings near to the point of becoming stoical.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Casey then pushes Ruby away; Younes explained that Casey thinks he is doing it for her own good because he does not want to &quot;drag her down with him&quot;. Ruby does not understand Casey's actions, but he realises it will add to the &quot;strain&quot; on her when he is sent to jail.&lt;ref name=week/&gt;

Casey is sentenced to thirty days in juvenile detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=5401: Casey hears his fate in court|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/spoilers/a351725/5401-casey-hears-his-fate-in-court.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=11 January 2012|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peacocke told ''TV Week'' that &quot;Brax is disappointed that it's got to this because, he has always wanted to keep Casey out of trouble.&quot; He said that Casey is not like Brax or Heath and because juvenile detention is &quot;dangerous&quot; he would not cope as well as they would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Erin|title=Bitter and broken-hearted|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=8–14 October 2011|issue=41|pages=6–7|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younes confirmed that Casey's time in jail would not go well and viewers would see a &quot;darker more wary Casey&quot; upon his return.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Ewing also said the storyline would &quot;harden Casey up&quot; and not return as the &quot;same teenager&quot; that departs.&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;{{cite web|last=Kikelly|first=Daniel|title='Home and Away' Casey to &quot;toughen up&quot; in new plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/scoop/a333957/home-and-away-casey-to-toughen-up-in-new-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=10 January 2012|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car accident===
Casey is accompanied to Bianca and Heath's wedding party with new friend [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]). She meets [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh Barrett]] (Jackson Gallagher) and flirts with him. Maddy's foster mother [[Roo Stewart]] ([[Georgie Parker]]) attempts to convince a reluctant Maddy to leave the party so Casey agrees to look after her. She defies Casey by sneaking off with Josh. Younes told a reporter from ''TV Week'' that Casey is unhappy with Maddy's actions and believes she should not lose her virginity because she wants to rebel.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; When Casey drags Maddy away from Josh a fight ensues and they drive off. However Josh and his brother [[Andy Barrett]] ([[Tai Hara]]) start a car chase. Younes explained that Maddy is making amends for her behaviour towards Casey when a four-wheel-drive hits them and sends the car careering off the road. The actors explained that &quot;Maddy is unconscious and the car is burning so he has to act very quickly, he's really hurt but manages to carry Maddy out of the car before it explodes.&quot; The car then explodes and the impact knocks the duo to the ground. They are not thought to be missing and spend the night injured on the road side until Maddy manages to get help.&lt;ref name=crash/&gt; ''Home and Away'' invested in big stunt scenes for the storyline. Younes revealed that he filmed his own stunts carrying Clementi when the explosion was carried out and he dived to the ground. The car chase scenes were filmed at night on location down a narrow road. Younes described the shoot as a &quot;scary&quot; scenario.&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Heroes of the Bay|date=24–30 August 2013|issue=34|pages=10, 11|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident leaves Casey with life changing injuries and is bound to a wheelchair. The storyline sees him struggle to accept his situation and struggle to recover. Tamara tries to support Casey through his recovery despite his reluctance to use his wheel chair or attend physical therapy.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt; Younes told Gavin Scott (''TV Week'') that Casey feels &quot;completely deected and depressed, because Casey is such an active person, to come to terms with the fact he might not be able to be active again is incredibly hard. For him, as soon as he gets into that wheel chair it's giving up.&quot; Younes did not enjoy using the wheel chair and found it &quot;horrible&quot; because of the emotional impact. When he researched the storyline many of the stories he encountered upset him.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gavin|last1=Scott|journal=[[TV Week]]|title=Love to the rescue?|date=7–13 September 2013|issue=36|pages=10|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was nice to see him, for a moment in time, turn into Brax and what Brax had taught him and that was to put family first. He died trying to protect him after Brax had spent his life protecting Casey...it was nice to see that switch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickery&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
Casey arrives in Summer Bay with his brothers Darryl, known as &quot;Brax&quot;, and Heath, as their gang, the River Boys, are extending their turf beyond Mangrove River. Casey befriends [[Romeo Smith]] ([[Luke Mitchell]]), who becomes concerned about Casey's attitude situation. When Romeo goes to Casey's house, as he needs assistance with his school work, he realises that Casey has a bad home life. His alcoholic mother [[Cheryl Braxton]] (Suzi Dougherty) shows little interest in him and his older brothers Heath and Brax continuously puts him down. Casey has a [[one-night stand]] with [[Ruby Buckton]] ([[Rebecca Breeds]]), who is attempting to move on from her ex Romeo. Casey furiously attacks Romeo when he discovers that he treated her poorly and ends their friendship. Casey and Ruby's attraction leads to a romantic relationship, but their future is put into question when they have to overcome disapproval from Ruby's police sergeant sister, Charlie, who cannot accept the fact he is a River Boy.

Casey gets a job at Angelo's delivering pizza. He and Ruby organise a party at the home of one of his customers. Heath and the other River Boys gate crash the party, causing the police to break it up. Casey struggles with his school work and [[Miles Copeland (Home and Away)|Miles Copeland]] ([[Josh Quong Tart]]) suspects that he may be dyslexic. Cheryl is angry at the school's recommendation that he gets tested. Miles decides to mentor Casey to help him through the HSC. Casey feels pressured by Cheryl to leave school, especially when she gets him a job at the fishery. Casey quits school, angering Brax, who feels Casey is throwing his bright future away. Brax endeavours to persuade Casey to return to school. When he does, Cheryl throws him out of the house and Brax hires a motel room for him to live in. Brax realises that the set-up is not practical, so he convinces [[Roo Stewart]] ([[Georgie Parker]]) to let him live at her flat with Romeo and [[Indigo Walker]] ([[Samara Weaving]]).

Casey lets [[Tegan Callahan]] ([[Saskia Burmeister]]) hide money belonging to rival gang member Jake Pirovic at his place. Jake kidnaps Casey and Ruby and when Brax turns up to rescue them, he is stabbed. Jake is arrested and sent to jail and his brother [[Hammer Pirovic|Hammer]] ([[Benedict Samuel]]) sets out to gain revenge on the Braxtons. Casey brings a knife into school in order to protect himself, just in case he is attacked and Miles sees it. [[Gina Austin]] ([[Sonia Todd]]) then excludes Casey. She later gives him a second chance so he can concentrate on the HSC. Shortly after, Casey dumps Ruby when he becomes annoyed at her constantly nagging him about the HSC. Casey is frustrated at being unable to help his older brothers in the fight with Hammer's gang. Casey decides against attending Tegan's funeral and he goes to Jake's place and sets it on fire. As everyone is at the funeral, no one is injured and the fire is put out. Brax learns Casey started the fire and while angry, he helps him cover his tracks. [[Georgina Watson]] (Jaclyn Albergoni) suspects Casey is behind the arson attack and questions him over the incident. The police later find CCTV evidence placing him in the area minutes before and after the fire. Heath tries to convince Casey to run away, but he hands himself in. Casey continues to push Ruby away to protect her. When he assumes she is flirting with [[Xavier Austin]] ([[David Jones-Roberts]]), they resume dating and she agrees to wait for him. On the day of Casey's court case, Magistrate Hanson ([[Rhett Walton]]) decides to make an example of Casey and sends him to jail for thirty days. Casey is later given early release and surprises Ruby by accompanying him to the school formal. He then comforts Ruby and Brax after Charlie is murdered by Jake.

Heath's ex-girlfriend, [[Henrietta Brown]] (Emma Leonard), begins teaching at the high school and she becomes Casey's tutor. Casey develops a crush on her and they later share a kiss. Casey and Henri begin a secret relationship, but when Heath finds out, he publicly outs the affair to Gina. Henri ends the relationship and leaves the Bay. [[Sasha Bezmel]] ([[Demi Harman]]) supports Casey when he is bullied by a teacher and she later confesses her feelings for him, but Casey reveals he does not feel the same way. Casey meets his father, [[Danny Braxton|Danny]] (Andy McPhee), and decides to forge a relationship with him. However, he later admits to Brax that he is spending time with Danny, so he can stop him from targeting Ruby and her money. Danny involves Casey in his plan to rob a pub. When Danny tells Casey to shoot the owner, he refuses and shoots Danny instead and he dies. Casey struggles to cope with what he has done and he later goes out to the forest with Sasha, where he has sex with her. He later dismisses their night together, upsetting Sasha. Casey is kidnapped by his half-brother, [[Kyle Braxton|Kyle Bennett]] (Nic Westaway) who wants to avenge their father's death and is taken to the desert and deprived of food and water. Kyle forces Casey to make a goodbye call to Brax unaware that Casey gives Brax hints to his location before Kyle leaves him to die of thirst and hunger. [[Tamara Kingsley]] ([[Kelly Paterniti]]) finds Casey and gives him water. Kyle soon returns after learning of Brax searching for Casey and forces both he and Tamara into his truck. Casey distracts Kyle long enough for Tamara to escape.  She seriously injures Kyle after throwing a lit petrol container at him, which alerts Brax to Casey's location. He and [[Natalie Davison]] ([[Catherine Mack]]) rescue Casey and take him home. Tamara turns up in the Bay for Casey's court case. Casey develops feelings for her and they begin dating. Casey is wrongfully arrested for a robbery that he did not commit. [[Ricky Sharpe (Home and Away)|Ricky Sharpe]] (Bonnie Sveen) later confesses to framing Casey on the orders of her brother, [[Adam Sharpe|Adam]] ([[Martin Lynes]]). On his release from prison, Casey refuses to forgive Ricky which causes a strain in his relationship with Brax when he starts a relationship with Ricky. After Tamara is kidnapped by Adam, the trauma causes her to lose her memories of her time in the Bay. Casey tries to get her to remember him and he is devastated when she begins a relationship with Kyle. Having a difficult time coping with losing Tamara, Casey starts drinking heavily and isolates himself from his friends and family. After a night of partying with [[Maddy Osborne]] ([[Kassandra Clementi]]), Casey suffers from [[alcohol poisoning]] and is rushed to the hospital but later recovers. Whilst driving her home from Heath and [[Bianca Scott]]'s ([[Lisa Gormley]]) beach party wedding reception, Casey and Maddy are run off the road by [[Josh Barrett (Home and Away)|Josh]] (Jackson Gallagher) and [[Andy Barrett]] ([[Tai Hara]]) and he suffers a spinal injury. Casey has difficulty coping with the news that he may be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Brax and Heath are furious upon finding out the truth but are stopped by Bianca and Maddy from taking revenge against the Barretts. A depressed Casey refuses to get out of bed to try his wheelchair or go for physiotherapy. After much persuasion from Tamara and [[Dexter Walker]] ([[Charles Cottier]]) he begins his recovery and takes his first steps.

While recovering, Casey and Tamara rekindle their relationship and Tamara breaks up with Kyle. Torn between his love for Tamara and loyalty to his brother, Kyle chooses to let Tamara go, but Casey later breaks up with Tamara, believing their relationship is no longer right. Casey supports his brothers through tough times and has a brief fling with a girl called [[Home and away characters#Linda Somerset|Linda Somerset]] (Hannah Britland) when the brothers visit London together. Back in the bay, Casey struggles when Brax reveals that he is in fact the son of Johnny Barrett; making him Josh Barrett's half-brother, and meaning that Kyle is unrelated to him. He feels betrayed that Brax kept this from him for several months, but eventually comes to accept it with the help of [[Denny Miller (Home and Away)|Denny Miller]] (Jessica Grace Smith). Casey helps Tamara when she is hit by a car and her eyesight is affected due a bleed in her brain, and eventually convinces her to leave Summer Bay to get treatment near where her parents live. Denny's boyfriend [[Chris Harrington (Home and Away)|Chris Harrington]] ([[Johnny Ruffo]]) becomes jealous and punches Casey when he believes he has feelings for Denny; afterwards, Casey and Denny briefly end their friendship before realising their feelings for each other and begin dating after Denny breaks up with Chris. Casey realises Andy is dealing drugs for Jake, who has escaped from prison where he had been serving his sentence for Charlie's murder, and tries to stop him; the situation escalates further when Brax discovers Andy's actions and Jake holds Josh hostage. Casey rushes to Josh's aid and is shot dead by Jake, saving Josh's life. In 2015, Ricky gave birth to her and Brax's son and they both named their son after Casey in his honour.

==Creation and casting==
In late 2010, [[Network Seven]] began running teaser trailers for a new trio of characters known as &quot;The River Boys&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;/&gt; Said to be a &quot;bad-boy surf gang with dodgy reputations&quot;, The River Boys consist of three brothers – Heath, [[Darryl Braxton]] ([[Steve Peacocke]]) and [[Casey Braxton|Casey]] ([[Lincoln Younes]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;/&gt; Koby Abberton's [[Bra Boys]] were the inspiration for The River Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a305999/real-river-boy-discusses-ha-gang.html|title='Real River Boy' discusses 'H&amp;A' gang|last=Kelly|first=Kristy|date=25 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath made his on screen debut in February 2011.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web|last=Houston|first=Melinda|title=Teenage dream|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;kw=lincoln+younes&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SAG110123S5MLS7DH4B6|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=3 February 2012|date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath was the first of The River Boys to be announced, with Ewing's casting revealed on 24 September 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVHeath&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/09/new-hunk-for-summer-bay.html|title=New hunk for Summer Bay|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heath is Ewing's second role with ''Home and Away'', having appeared as Reuben Humphries in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVHeath&quot;/&gt; For his role, Ewing had to get fit and he joked &quot;I don't think they would cast overweight guys to play surfers, so yeah, I'm sure it was a factor for the producers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RelishesRiver&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/homeandaway/news/dan-relishes-river-boy-fever-12954|title=Dan relishes River Boy fever|date=15 March 2011|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he cannot surf well and was relieved that the producers did not test his surfing skills at his audition.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelishesRiver&quot;/&gt; Initially, Ewing was employed as a member of the guest cast. He told Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]] that Heath was originally planned to be a part of the series for six months, but revealed that he had since joined the regular cast.&lt;ref name=dsint&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Dan Ewing - 'Home and Away' Heath Braxton|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/interviews/a332031/dan-ewing-home-and-away-heath-braxton.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=5 February 2012|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterisation===
{{cquote|There's no messing with Heath Braxton. Famed for his short fuse, hot temper and powerful left hook, police, Mangrove River locals and even his fellow surfers would do well to keep their distance. Brawn over brain, action man Heath is quick to let his fists do the talking, and has earned himself a reputation with gang members and cops alike. He's proud of and loyal to his River Boy connection, valuing the respect that comes with being a member; for him there's no stronger bond.|4=''[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on Heath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heath Braxton|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/home-and-away/characters/heath-braxton|work=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|publisher=([[Northern &amp; Shell]])|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heath is the second oldest of the Braxton brothers and was initially described as being &quot;feared by cops and the residents of his home town of Mangrove River&quot; and having a short fuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;SurfGang&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sunday-telegraph/bay-surf-gang-making-waves/story-e6frewt9-1225983762243|title=Bay surf gang making waves|last=Schipp|first=Debbie|date=9 January 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Heath is described as &quot;Mad, bad and dangerous to know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HeathSeven&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/8732111/heath-braxton/|title=Heath Braxton|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Network Seven]])|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of The River Boys, Heath is the most volatile and he is feared by everyone from the police to the Mangrove River residents. Darryl is the only person Heath listens to and he follows his guidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeathSeven&quot;/&gt; Channel Seven say Heath &quot;loves the camaraderie and sense of family, not to mention the respect that comes with being a member.

==Storylines==
Heath arrives in Summer Bay along with his brothers; Darryl and Casey. Heath earns a reputation as a troublemaker and he harasses Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood) in the Diner. When Heath notices [[Dexter Walker]] ([[Charles Cottier]]) filming him and friends, he puts him in the boot of his car and dumps him in the bush. Heath causes a lot of trouble with the police for dealing drugs and loitering on the beach. He makes an enemy out of local policewoman [[Charlie Buckton]] ([[Esther Anderson (Australian actress)|Esther Anderson]]). Heath develops an interest in [[Bianca Scott]] ([[Lisa Gormley]]) and they have sex, even though Bianca is dating [[Liam Murphy]] ([[Axle Whitehead]]). Bianca tells Heath that it was a mistake. Heath learns that he has a daughter, [[Darcy Callahan|Darcy]] (Alea O'Shea), and starts to bond with her. When Bianca is raped at a party, Heath becomes the prime suspect. However, he is later cleared. Heath stops a man from harassing Bianca and her friends, and she starts to respect him. Bianca and Heath have sex again. On the way home from a trip, Charlie and Brax crash into Liam. Bianca realises that she still loves Liam and ends her relationship with Heath. Heath begins dating Bianca's younger sister, [[April Scott (Home and Away)|April]] ([[Rhiannon Fish]]). Bianca gets angry at Heath and warns him to stay away from April. Heath cheats on April with [[Henrietta Brown]] ([[Emma Leonard]]) and she breaks up with him.

Bianca marries Liam and finds out that she is pregnant. She initially tells Heath that the baby cannot be his, but later discovers her pregnancy is too far along for the baby to be Liam's. April tells Heath that he is the father and he is furious with Bianca and Liam for not telling him. When he learns that the couple are planning to leave the Bay, Heath hires [[Hayley O'Connor]] ([[Alyssa McClelland]]) to help him get joint custody. Liam and Bianca split up and Heath drops the court case. Heath goes to visit his father, [[Danny Braxton|Danny]] (Andy McPhee), in prison and decides to help get him released. Bianca develops pre-eclampsia and tells Heath that if anything happens, he must tell the doctors to save the baby. Bianca gives birth prematurely to a boy. She develops postnatal psychosis and thinks her baby is dead. Heath supports Bianca and visits their son. Bianca eventually recovers and she and Heath name their son Rocco. Heath and Bianca start dating again. Heath becomes angry with Casey when he shoots their father dead and refuses to talk to him for a while. Bianca comes to stay with Heath and briefly clashes with his mother. Rocco dies from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, devastating Heath. Bianca pulls away from him and he later breaks down in front of Brax. Bianca asks Heath to restrict the funeral to family only and they say goodbye to their son. Heath later places a wreath in the ocean and joins the River Boys for an all night memorial at the beach.

Heath proposes to Bianca and she accepts. During a trip to Melbourne for his stag party, Heath has a one-night stand with [[Jess Lockwood]] (Georgia Chara). During his wedding, Heath confesses to Bianca and she punches him. Heath decides to leave the Bay, but Bianca stops him. Heath and Bianca get married. When [[Jade Montgomery]] ([[Tasma Walton]]) comes to the Bay after Mangrove River High is burnt down, she tries to frame Heath with an assault claim, but is thwarted by [[Tamara Kingsley]] ([[Kelly Paterniti]]). While Heath is visiting Brax's girlfriend, [[Ricky Sharpe]] (Bonnie Sveen), in the hospital, a bomb explodes. Heath is okay, but Bianca suffers a serious head injury, which causes some memory loss. A heavily pregnant Jess comes to the Bay to tell Heath that he is going to be a father. Heath helps deliver his son, [[List of Home and Away characters (2014)#Harley|Harley]], on the beach and he spends time with Jess and Harley in Melbourne, causing a strain on his marriage. Heath soon learns that Jess has terminal cancer and when she dies, he brings Harley to live with him and Bianca. Bianca struggles to cope with Harley's presence and she and Heath break up. They eventually get back together, but Bianca soon learns that her transfer request to the city has been accepted. Heath encourages her to go, saying he will join her soon. Darcy's grandmother, [[List of Home and Away characters (2013)#Connie Callahan|Connie]] ([[Celia Ireland]]), initially refuses to let Darcy live with Heath and Bianca in the city, but later relents. After one final surf with his brothers, Heath says goodbye to his family. Bianca returns to collect Heath, Darcy and Harley and take them to their new place in the city. Heath attends Casey's funeral weeks later. Brax refuses to let him seek revenge on [[Jake Pirovic]] ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and Heath replies that he does not want to bury Brax the following week.

Two years later, Heath follows Bianca to the Bay despite her asking him to give her some space. Bianca asks him to leave, but he stays in the Bay. Bianca invites him over to talk and it emerges that Heath killed [[Trevor Gunson]] ([[Diarmid Heidenreich]]).

Since their inception, the Braxton brothers have been well received. Claire Crick of ''[[All About Soap]]'' said the publications staff were happy with their arrival.

'''Brendan Seamus Brady''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Emmett J. Scanlan]]. The character was introduced in 2010 by series producer [[Paul Marquess]] during part of the show's overhaul, and has become one of ''Hollyoaks''{{'}} most popular characters. He is easily recognised by his famous moustache. He is the older half-brother of already established character [[Cheryl Brady]] ([[Bronagh Waugh]]). Following the announcement of Brendan's casting, he was quickly billed as the show's new &quot;bad boy&quot; character. Despite having the persona of a villain at the start of the show, as the show progressed the character was portrayed to be more of a tragic [[antihero]] than a villain. He made his last appearance on 22 March 2013.

==Creation and casting==
Irish actor Emmett J. Scanlan was cast as Brendan by series producer [[Paul Marquess]] after being put forward for the role by casting director Dorothy Andrews.&lt;ref name=&quot;marquess int&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a295717/paul-marquess-producer-hollyoaks.html |title=Paul Marquess (Producer, 'Hollyoaks') |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scanlan previously auditioned for the roles of [[Kieron Hobbs]] and [[Des Townsend]], but was asked by producers to drop his accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a303940/scanlan-hollyoaks-reaction-is-flattering.html |title=Scanlan: 'Hollyoaks reaction is flattering'
|work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brendan was originally to be from [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], like sister [[Cheryl Brady]]. This detail was however changed to make Cheryl and Brendan half-siblings and Brendan's backstory was changed so he comes from [[Dublin, Ireland]], to avoid confusion with Scanlan's accent.&lt;ref name=&quot;marquess int&quot;/&gt;

Details of the character of Brendan were first hinted in April 2010, when Marquess referred to Brendan as a &quot;very nasty man&quot; appearing from Cheryl's past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a215259/new-mcqueen-heading-to-hollyoaks.html |title=New McQueen heading to Hollyoaks |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td4Gmfip|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in April, Brendan's casting was officially announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;new bad boy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a215499/new-bad-boy-for-hollyoaks.html |title=New bad boy for Hollyoaks |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |author=Daniel Kilkelly and Kris Green |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td4LPnLr|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;new cast&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a233106/hollyoaks-confirms-more-new-cast.html |title=Hollyoaks confirms more new cast |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td4OomNb|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time of his casting, the characters of [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) and [[Bart McQueen]] ([[Jonny Clarke]]) were also signed to appear in the show. Marquess spoke of the characters' arrivals, saying: &quot;This is a really exciting time for ''Hollyoaks'' and Brendan, Lynsey and Bart bring more fun, drama and sexiness to the show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new cast&quot;/&gt; Scanlan commented on his new role, saying: &quot;I'm a bad-ass in it. I play a bad guy with a dark secret who goes by [the] name of Brendan. It's a good healthy stint of six to seven months and I can't wait to get started. It's all about new experiences and ''Hollyoaks'' has a very impressive history. It's great to be part of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new bad boy&quot;/&gt; Scanlan originally signed a six-month contract, which was later extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a295729/more-hollyoaks-chat-from-paul-marquess.html |title=More 'Hollyoaks' chat from Paul Marquess |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
The main focal point of Brendan's characteristics was his 'villain' persona. Scanlan described Brendan's personality, saying: &quot;I don't know how to describe him in five words. I don't think he is either good or bad. Brendan's a man who defines his own moral code and principles, and lives with the consequences. He's the type of dude that will hit you as quick as look at you, but never touch a girl. His principles may be different to yours or mine but he's not good or bad, he's just... Brendan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e4.com/hollyoaks/interviews/2010/emmettjscanlan.html |title=Interview with Emmett J. Scanlan (Brendan Brady) |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4]] |publisher=([[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television Corporation]]) |date=August 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td3V3j04|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Hollyoaks'' spokesperson has said that Brendan &quot;loves having power over people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/gameon/view/156559/Hollyoaks-Ste-Hay-asks-Brendan-Brady-for-cash/ |title=Hollyoaks: Ste Hay asks Brendan Brady for cash |work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] |publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]] |first=Susan |last=Hill |date=3 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td3iiKTU|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress Bronagh Waugh, who plays Brendan's sister Cheryl, has claimed that Brendan is &quot;one of the most evil soap villains ever&quot;, stating: &quot;Brendan is the nastiest bad boy I've ever seen — I'm talking worse than ''[[EastEnders]]''' [[Den Watts|Dirty Den]]. If you think he's been mean so far, you haven't seen anything yet! The thing is that he does care for Cheryl and has good intentions towards her. But events won't turn out the way he planned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a269391/waugh-oaks-brendan-nastiest-bad-boy-ever.html |title=Waugh: 'Oaks Brendan nastiest bad boy ever' |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Colin |last=Daniels |date=29 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td3uIppr|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in May 2010, Marquess was asked about Brendan and if he was a bad boy. He replied: &quot;Oh, definitely — he's an absolute bastard! I think people are going to think, 'Here's the next [[Warren Fox|Warren]]', but they'll be surprised when they find out what the real story is. He is Cheryl's half-brother… and Cheryl won't hear a bad word against him...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a220233/loads-of-hollyoaks-gossip-from-paul-marquess.html |title=Loads of Hollyoaks gossip from Paul Marquess |work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Kris |last=Green |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td3p4OJb|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further interview with ''[[Press Association]]'', Scanlan said: &quot;I have never had the opportunity to play somebody as complex and as damaged as Brendan. He is without doubt a sociopathic, self-loathing, homophobic gay man and that in itself is a fascinating attraction for any actor to play. I think any actor would love a challenge, when you're doing a role if it pushes your boundaries and takes you out of yourself and allows you to experience different things. I think that's great. So coming up to do the part was exciting for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brendan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a281229/scanlan-playing-brendan-is-a-challenge.html |title=Scanlan: 'Playing Brendan is a challenge' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Colin |last=Daniels |date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td3xzhC3|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanlan later spoke about his character and said: &quot;Brendan is a king manipulator. He lulls people into a false sense of security — it's like a fly being drawn to the spider. Because he's such a king manipulator, he can talk the underwear off this fella [Ste] and he's very confident. So yeah, he definitely knows. He sees Stephen as a young, vulnerable guy who has no male friends, who hasn't had a father figure, and who — like Brendan — is a father himself. So Brendan can play with that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;escanlan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a282611/emmett-scanlan-brendan-brady-hollyoaks.html |title=Emmett Scanlan (Brendan Brady, Hollyoaks) |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-18&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td45IK1V|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called Brendan &quot;unpredictable&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;escanlan&quot;/&gt;

Marquess revealed in December 2010 that 2011 would explore more of the character's background and the reasons for his &quot;twisted&quot; personality: &quot;What we've played in 2010 in introducing Brendan is this very dark and twisted character. One thing we want to do in 2011 is to explain why he's like that. The whole domestic violence angle does continues to play but in really quite an unexpected way. The safest thing I can say is everyone should remember it was Ste who hit Amy [Barnes] first. So it's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jQJaHKh64lj8D6tFJh0oJIK6enNQ?docId=N0403211293795326410A |title=Brendan's dark side to be explained |work=[[Press Association]] |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
In September 2010, [[Kieron Richardson]] announced an upcoming gay plot featuring his character [[Ste Hay]] and Brendan, claiming the pair would embark on an &quot;unusual friendship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gay plot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a276979/oaks-actor-comes-out-confirms-gay-plot.html |title='Oaks actor comes out, confirms gay plot |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Ryan |last=Love |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-09&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td2k2rna|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brendan and Ste's relationship will become violent, touching on [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gay plot&quot;/&gt; After the announcement, Paul Marquess said: &quot;This is a long running storyline and while it is dark to begin with, the lessons that Ste learns are ultimately positive and life affirming. This story is about not being afraid to be who you are and while this is something Brendan struggles with, Ste is refreshingly accepting of his feelings towards another man. I hope viewers will be glued throughout the twists and turns as we unravel how Brendan came to be the twisted person we have been watching on screen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gay plot&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Brendan and Ste.png|thumb|left|200px|Ste kisses Brendan, the start of the gay plot (2010).]]
Meanwhile, Scanlan admitted he was glad Brendan is becoming &quot;a complex character&quot; and &quot;not a gratuitous soap villain, but a multi-layered character with depth, a troubled past and an unsure future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://holysoap.five.tv/hollyoaks/news/brendans-just-misunderstood-9806 |title=Brendan's just misunderstood! |work=[[Holy Soap]] |publisher=([[Channel 5 (UK TV channel)|Channel 5 Broadcasting]]) |date=17 September |accessdate=2010-10-10&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td2XhKwI|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued: &quot;I hope that as the storyline develops, viewers will be able to understand why Brendan has become the villain they see today. Brendan is compelled to manipulate and control everyone who crosses his path. At the moment this makes him dangerous but when we identify why he behaves this way, we will discover his vulnerabilities and this is exciting...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gay plot&quot;/&gt;

Scanlan later explained: &quot;Because ''Hollyoaks'' is a 6.30pm show we had to find different ways to tell the story in a convincing way and leave most of it to the imagination of the audience. And in more cases than not, your own imagination is much more visual and more horrific than what you see on screen, so we tried to push things, drop little things, without actually showing anything explicit, but it was an incredible experience. Brendan's an extraordinary character to play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brendan&quot;/&gt;

A spokesperson for ''Hollyoaks'' described the storyline in October 2010, saying: &quot;Ste doesn't realise how much power and control Brendan is wielding over him. He's still coming to terms with his sexuality. Brendan is the only man he's ever slept with so he feels a connection he’s never felt before. Even when Brendan beat him up he somehow managed to turn it all on Ste so he was the one that ended up apologising. And sadly, once they've slept together things are only going to get worse. This storyline is one of the darkest in the soap's history and viewers will be shocked at the lengths Brendan goes to over the next few months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/gameon/view/158595/Hollyoaks-Brendan-gets-Ste-excited/ |title=Hollyoaks' Brendan gets Ste excited |work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] |publisher=([[Northern and Shell|Northern and Shell Media Publications]]) |date=17 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-17&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tczNSd7Q|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right|quote=&quot;&quot;I think that the Brendan and Ste storyline has been fantastic — they're both brilliant and, God, you couldn't have asked for stronger chemistry than what they've got on screen&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;marquess int&quot;/&gt; |source=—Paul Marquess discussing Brendan and Ste's relationship}}
Scanlan, in an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', explained the research he put into the abuse storyline: &quot;The thing about it is that every case is different and every story is different. The principles are the same, but it's always different. With this, the writers give you your homework, so to speak — you explore it and you research it, because you want to give it the best truthfulness that you can. Obviously it's your work that's going out on screen, and your credibility goes with that. So you definitely need to do your homework.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;escanlan more&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282709/more-from-hollyoaks-star-emmett-scanlan.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Emmett Scanlan |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-18&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5td2qobHZ|archivedate=20 October 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; After asked about what kind of impact and response he wanted the storyline to have, Scanlan replied: &quot;I've always wanted the storyline to be subtle. I didn't want it to be thrown into this violent, sociopathic gay relationship straight away as that would lose its credibility — and credit to the writers and Paul Marquess because it has been very subtle and it's built over the weeks,&quot; he continued, &quot;I also want the story to evoke emotion — not just in the cast around me, but in the crew, the writers, the producers and the people who are investing half an hour of their lives into watching Hollyoaks each night. Whether those emotions are hatred, disgust or love or anything — I just want it to evoke something. I want it to touch on things, and I hope people are affected by it. But things like this are completely outside of the actors' control - we just have to give some truth to the storyline and try to make it as interesting as possible. We can't leave people short-changed. You never know, Brendan might become the most hated guy in England soon - that'd be a nice thing to have on the resumé!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;escanlan more&quot;/&gt;

===Departure===
On 9 January 2013, Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]] announced Brendan's departure from the show. Scanlan had decided to leave the role and his character is scheduled to depart in March 2013.&lt;ref name=leavingtheshow/&gt; He explained that &quot;the time has come for me to sign out of Hollyoaks, to bow out as Double B aka Brendan motherfucking Brady.&quot; Sharing the experience with fans had been the &quot;greatest honour&quot; for the actor. Kilkelly added that producers had devised a dramatic exit storyline for Brendan but remained secretive about any other details.&lt;ref name=leavingtheshow&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Hollyoaks': Emmett Scanlan leaving Brendan Brady role|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a449506/hollyoaks-emmett-scanlan-leaving-brendan-brady-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
Brendan first arrives during a fight between [[Mercedes McQueen|Mercedes Fisher]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) and Cheryl. He holds Cheryl back, and introduces himself as Cheryl's brother. He then catches up with Cheryl and reveals he caught his wife Eileen in bed with another man, and so he left his wife and kids behind in Ireland. Cheryl is sympathetic towards him. Whilst staying with Cheryl, Brendan steals £20 from her wallet. Later on in [[The Dog in the Pond]], Cheryl mentions how she was unable to buy The Loft nightclub. Brendan tells her he has a friend called [[Danny Houston]] ([[Darren Day]]) who could help out. Barman [[Carl Costello]] ([[Paul Opacic]]) recognises the name and warns [[Malachy Fisher]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) that Danny is shady and potentially dangerous. Malachy confronts Brendan about this, but Brendan warns him to mind his own business. The McQueen home is robbed by [[Veronica (Hollyoaks)|Veronica]] (Lynsey McLaren), an accomplice of Brendan's. Brendan begins working as a manager at ChezChez after Cheryl goes into partnership with Danny. Brendan then robs the club, but is recognised by Malachy. Cheryl does not believe that Brendan is responsible for the theft of the club's takings. To cover his tracks, Brendan later frames Veronica, who is arrested.

Brendan befriends [[Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]), and plans to use her to smuggle drugs into the country from [[Barcelona]]. Ste convinces Carmel not to go, but when Brendan decides to take Ste's ex-girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]), Ste convinces Carmel to go ahead with the holiday after all. The student halls of residence is burgled by [[Doug Carter]] (PJ Brennan), who gives Brendan the money for drugs. Brendan's wife Eileen turns up at ChezChez unexpected. She reveals that their son Declan is ill and needs money for specialist treatment. Brendan accidentally mugs Cheryl, believing it was [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]). He then pays Eileen the money. As she leaves, Ste tells Malachy he believes Brendan was responsible for Cheryl's mugging, after seeing Brendan give Eileen the money. Malachy and [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) confront Cheryl, who again refuses to believe Brendan would do such a thing.

When [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) returns, Brendan is jealous of her and Ste's relationship. Veronica arrives at ChezChez and ends up kissing Ste, following Brendan's orders, as Rae walks in. When Ste overhears Brendan talking to Veronica, he confronts him as to why he was trying to end Ste and Rae's relationship. Brendan invites [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) to lunch with him and Danny. He assumes that he and Jacqui have a relationship, however seems angered when Jacqui does not show interest. Ste overhears a phone conversation between Brendan and Macca, whom he is shouting at. Brendan violently begins trashing the office when Macca ends the phone call and when he notices Ste, he tells him to leave. After Brendan returns from a business trip, he is furious to discover Macca has arrived in Hollyoaks and has been given a job by Cheryl. Brendan later threatens Macca, who is not seen again. Jacqui finds Brendan with bloody hands, suggesting he beat Macca up. After a night out, Brendan and Ste return to Brendan's home, where they eventually kiss. Brendan reacts by throwing a confused Ste out. The next day, Ste is worried when Brendan confronts him. However, they kiss again. Ste questions whether Brendan is avoiding him, however Brendan tells him to lock the door to the cellar so they are alone. As Ste tries to kiss Brendan, Brendan punches Ste, and he falls to the floor. Brendan later manipulates Ste into telling Cheryl that he was mugged.

Brendan later tells Ste that it was all his fault and manages to get Ste into bed yet again. Amy finds out about Ste and Brendan and Brendan's abuse of Ste. Brendan continually threatens her to keep quiet. On the same night, Il Gnosh is set fire to whilst Amy is babysitting in the flat above and she is almost killed. At hospital, Macca reappears following his beating from Brendan, who he tells he wants back. Brendan threatens Macca, telling him to leave for Northern Ireland once again. Cheryl then invites Macca to stay with her and Brendan. Amy tells Ste that she thinks Brendan started the fire and decides to move away for her own safety. Macca tells Rae about Ste and Brendan's relationship. Rae confronts Ste over the affair and later tells Cheryl that Brendan is gay, which he denies. Brendan begins a brief relationship with [[India Longford]] ([[Beth Kingston]]).

Brendan and Ste go on a date in public. However, Brendan is uncomfortable and leaves. Danny and Brendan decide to get rid of [[Warren Fox]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]). Brendan, however, double-crosses Danny after discovering he was responsible for the death of Brendan's former male lover. Danny agrees to sign over his half of Chez Chez, but tells Brendan he will be paying Ste a visit. Angered by Danny's threats, Brendan attacks and murders Danny by beating him with a hammer until he is killed. Warren and Brendan then dispose of Danny's body. Amy returns and confronts Brendan, telling him Rae is pregnant with Ste's child. Brendan later ends his relationship with Ste, giving him a final kiss as Mitzeee watches. Mitzeee confronts Brendan and agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend in exchange for him managing her modeling career, to which Brendan agrees. When Rae goes to an abortion clinic, Brendan manages to stop her and reveals that his first child Niamh died at birth. He also reveals his father left his mother for Cheryl's mother. Brendan and Rae become friends, but he continues to sleep with Ste. Mitzeee causes Rae to discover the affair. Brendan and Rae argue, which causes Rae to miscarry her child. After this, Rae blames Brendan.

After Danny Houston's body is found, Warren is arrested because Brendan planted his credit card into Danny's dead body. Warren realises that Brendan has set him up and so reveals to Ste that Brendan killed Danny Houston to protect him. After Ste confronts him, Brendan confirms that he killed Danny. Devastated, Ste tells him they're over. Brendan realises that Warren told Ste about Danny. Furious, he goes round to his and Mitzee's new flat where he catches her and Warren kissing. Fuming, they both storm outside and a huge fight erupts. Eventually, after fighting their way around the village, they decide to call a truce on their silly feud. After pushing Ste too far, Ste attacks Brendan then reveals to Cheryl he's gay. Cheryl also overhears Brendan telling old friend Pete Hamill he did steal from the club. Cheryl blames Brendan for her falling out with Malachy before his death and refuses to speak to Brendan. Brendan returns to Ireland but comes back two weeks later and hires Jenny to scam Warren out of £200,000. After getting the money Warren threatens to tell everyone he is gay which leads to Brendan outing himself by kissing Ste in the middle of the club. With his £200,000 Brendan buys 49% of Chez Chez.

Ste tells Brendan he has a new boyfriend Noah Baxter. Brendan then goes out of his way to split them up, first by attempting to seduce Noah. Though the plan works briefly, and Ste and Noah split, they reunite quickly. Ste then decides to move away with Noah but later changes his mind, after witnessing Noah cheating once again. Ste contemplates reuniting with Brendan, but he finds out the man Noah was with had been hired by Brendan. However, Brendan goes out of his way to get Ste back, eventually telling Ste he loves him. The pair sleep together again, when Brendan's ex-wife Eileen walks in on them and demands to know what is going on. Brendan revels it is a misunderstanding, and Eileen warns Brendan that if the children find out, she will ban him from seeing them. Eileen then tells Brendan he will have to look after [[Declan Brady|Declan]] (Jay Duffy) while she is away. He agrees to do so. Desperate to keep Ste as well though, Brendan agrees to go to Florida with him, but at the last minute, bottles it, heading to Blackpool with Declan instead.

Brendan also supports Lynsey, after she believes Silas Blissett is out to get her. Ste returns, and soon reveals to Declan that he is gay. Having to suffer Declan's questions, Brendan is angered by this, and warns Ste to stay away. As Ste continues making sniping comment to Brendan, Brendan lashes out, as Declan walks in. Ste threatens to go to the police, and gets as far as the police station before Brendan stops him, telling him about life growing up with his father. Brendan reveals that his dad would often come home drunk, drag Brendan out of bed, wanting to fight, whilst calling him names, which are linked to sexuality, but also in Brendan's head as weakness. Ste tells Brendan to tell Declan the truth, and Brendan agrees to do so, but changes his mind later.

Brendan decides that he wants to be in a relationship with a woman, and sees a vulnerable Lynsey as the perfect one. He makes his move on her, but is quickly rebuffed, and as the pair argue over the coming days, are unaware they are being watched by a camera Silas has hidden in the flat. As Lynsey continues to think she is being manipulated by Silas, she decides to leave for a while, but Brendan witnesses Silas watching Lynsey depart and warns Silas that he is keeping an eye on him. A week later Lynsey returns from her trip and says she feels calmer. However Brendan confesses to Lynsey that she might be right about Silas and tells her that he saw Silas watching her as she left. Brendan then helps Lynsey and Cheryl with their friendship. Silas however keeps on breaking into the flat and keeps messing with Lynsey's mind. So Brendan confronts Silas and threatens to kill him if he ever goes near Lynsey again.

After confronting Silas, Brendan tells Ste to go and keep an eye on Lynsey. Rae is not happy by the way Brendan bosses around Ste. She calls Brendan selfish and a bully. Brendan then grabs Rae's arm and tells her to stay away from him. Silas then helps Rae by telling her she should stand up to Brendan more often, but really he is after revenge on Brendan after his threat. Rae then goes to Lynsey's flat and yells at Ste, accidentally admitting Brendan is gay in front of his son Declan. Brendan then confesses to his son that he is gay and that is why he left his mother. Declan however, takes the news well and the pair hug. But Brendan goes after Rae and puts his hands on her throat and tells her to stay away from Declan and his family, or he will kill her.

Rae is murdered by Silas and her body is planted in Brendan's car boot. Silas leaves a note on the car telling Brendan to go to the woods, and Brendan assumes this note is from Lynsey, who earlier told him she was meeting someone from an online chatroom. He then goes to the woods to look for her, but she is not there. A phone rings in the boot of the car, and Brendan opens the boot to find Rae's dead body. At that moment, the police arrive and arrest Brendan, having been tipped off by Silas and suspecting Brendan of Rae's murder and the murders of India Longford and Rebecca Massey previously. He is put in prison and refused bail. He is then visited by Cheryl and Warren, who say they will find a way to show the police that he is innocent. Lynsey tries to show the police her online chat with the stranger, but the stranger's account has been deleted. Warren visits Brendan in prison and threatens Brendan to try to get him to sign over his share of the club. When Brendan refuses to hand over his part of the club, Warren orders his friends inside to beat Brendan up. However even after this, Brendan refused to hand over his share of the club. Later, during Halloween, Silas is finally exposed for his crimes after accidentally killing his own daughter Heidi Costello who he mistakes for Lynsey and is later jailed. The next week in the aftermath of the events Cheryl visits Brendan in Prison where he comes out bruised and battered by cellmates under contact with Warren.

After Brendan is released, he meets Warren's long lost son Joel. Joel lives with Warren and Mitzeee. When Mitzeee worries about the fact that Warren murdered his ex-wife, she turns to Brendan for comfort and together they hatch a plan to rid of Warren once and for all. A month later, Warren proposes to Mitzeee. When Warren discovers that she and Brendan had been plotting against him, he decides that he and Mitzeee should elope. Warren soon kidnaps Mitzeee and takes her to the place that he buried his ex-wife. He forces her to dig her own grave. Brendan takes Joel to rescue Mitzeee when in the car Joel pulls a gun on Brendan. When Brendan reaches Mitzeee and Warren, he tells Warren that he murdered Joel. They fight for the gun before Joel appears and knocks Warren out, revealing that he wasn't killed. The police arrive and arrest Warren.

Three months later, Joel returns to the village and reveals that Warren sold him his half of the club, much to Brendan's anger. Joel and Brendan battle for weeks until Brendan decides to take him under his wing as an apprentice. Over the next few weeks Brendan orders Joel to stay and live with him. When Brendan witnesses an encounter between Ste and Joel, resulting in a push and a broken bottle of wine, he is reminded how much he cares for Ste still. He offers to give Ste and Doug a business loan for a deli. After being rejected by Ste, Doug agrees after much persuasion. Later, finding out what had happened, Ste fakes getting back with Brendan so he can sign over the business over to him and stay with Doug. When Walker (an old cellmate) returns from prison, trouble comes with him. Brendan offered him a bed for the night, Walker takes it. Cheryl confronts him about the stash of money under his bed. Brendan kicks him out and concentrates on keeping Joel, Cheryl and Lynsey safe. When Walker returns later on, it results in Joel being stabbed and Brendan beating up Sampson. Joel eventually forgives Brendan and the two's relationship is on the up side.

A few weeks later Mitzeee turns up on his door step crying and shaking. Brendan is oblivious to what has happened. When Lynsey rings him and tells him about Merecedes he beckons Mitzeee to his car. Aware that the police are watching them, Mitzeee screams at Brendan to drive but Brendan tells her that she will not be able to live with the guilt and hands her over to the police. A week later Brendan receives a call from Sampson explaining that Joel is in a white van with a hand grenade tied to his hands. Walker and he rescue Joel and discover that the hand grenade was fake. When Brendan arrives at Chez Chez to find it trashed by Samson he clashes with Walker. He races home to find a dead Lynsey lying on the sofa. He swoops her up and lifts her into the middle of the village. Cheryl spotts her brother carrying a lifeless Lynsey and carefully placing her in the middle of the road. Cheryl screams over her body, while Brendan is still in shock, assuming that Sampson murdered Lynsey. He is later questioned by the police.

Brendan takes Cheryl to Ireland in an attempt to keep her safe. He returns when Walker reports that Sampson has trashed the club again. After Cheryl comes back, he confesses to her that he Sampson murdered Lynsey and she stops speaking to him. A week later, Brendan takes Samson's right-hand man hostage and finds out that Sampson is planning a million pound drug deal. He and Walker plan a drug heist for the next three weeks. A few days before the heist, Brendan's son Declan returns. When Walker and Brendan perform the heist, it all goes wrong and they only just escape the police after Walker shoots a cop.

At the beginning of September 2012, Brendan witnesses Joel's stepdad, Mick, beating up Joel, and Brendan encourages Joel to take the power back. They follow Mick to Southport, where they dangle him off a lighthouse. They did not mean to cause Mick any harm, but Joel's will to save Brendan from a grappling Mick causes Joel to push Mick off the lighthouse to his presumed death. Brendan then meets Cheryl and his Nana in Southport, and learns that his Nana is dying. She wants to visit her old holiday home one last time, and this makes Brendan noticeably uneasy. On the night before the journey to the home, Cheryl witnesses Brendan chopping up the definitely dead body of Mick. She is horrified. At the holiday home, Brendan remembers the past there with his Dad, and it is revealed how he was sexually abused by his father and that his grandmother knew and did nothing. She tries to apologize and asks him if that is the reason he is gay. He replies that no, it's not the reason he's gay. It's the reason he's a freak. They have a heart breaking talk in the garden where he blames her lack of action for his inability to be a father or love anyone. He tells her that she took his children, Ste and his sister away because she did nothing. He is visibly unhinged and when she tries to hug him, he smothers her against his chest, crying over her body afterwards. Brendan's anger causes him to smash up the house, resulting in a leaking gas pipe. Just before the house explodes, Brendan finds out that Walker is a cop. The holiday home explodes and the audience is left wondering whether Brendan is dead or alive.

Brendan survives the explosion, and once partially better, spends his time trying to save his loved ones (Ste, Cheryl and Declan) from the wrath of Walker. In his desperation to save Ste, Brendan jumps in front of a gun, and Walker accidentally shoots into the village and kills Riley. Walker then disappears.

With Doug away in America for Riley's funeral, Ste and Brendan growing increasingly closer. Cheryl suggest they go to a counselor as a last-ditch effort to repair their broken relationship. Brendan is reluctant but goes along with it, looking visibly upset when his childhood is brought up. Cheryl tells the story of how they met when Brendan ran away at her birthday party and stole all the attention on himself. The audience is able to infer from his short replies that he was concerned for her welfare from his father's abuse even at an early age and did it to protect her. He does not share any of this and instead trashes the desk in their second session in an attempt to not talk about it. Brendan realizes he needs to fix himself and leave immediately, moving into a nearby church, focusing on God to fix him. It is a powerful step in his redemption arch. Not long after, he agrees to me Cheryl in a park and is horrified to find out that Ste is to be married to Doug with in the week. Due to the insistence of the priest at the church, he is prepared to reveal his feelings to Ste, but bottles it at the last minute, and allows Ste to go ahead with the wedding. Ste is seriously injured in the bus crash at the wedding, and Brendan rushes to his side when he hears the news. After his trip to the hospital, Brendan turns to God and makes a promise to stay away from Ste, so long as God allows Ste to survive. Ste pulls through, and Brendan is therefore forced to keep his promise.

Ste and Doug try to make it as a married couple but Ste's feelings for Brendan are still obvious. When Doug's parents return for a visit from America they make the shocking confession that Doug's father is ill. Ste and Doug pack up to move to America but not before Ste visits Chez Chez and tells Brendan to ask him to stay. The pair kiss but Brendan pushes Ste away and punches him, later telling Cheryl it was because of his pact to God to stay away from Ste and the only way to make Ste move on. Brendan then leaves Hollyoaks and heads to Dublin. Cheryl tries to convince Ste his heart lies with Brendan but ends up accidentally telling Doug. When at the airport ready to depart to America Doug hands Ste a ticket to go to Dublin instead and the pair say an emotional goodbye after Doug admits to not wanting to be 'second best' to Brendan who is who Ste truly loves.

In Dublin Brendan is unable to spend time with his family, who tell him they want nothing to do with him at the train station. He bumps into [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) who recently broke up with boyfriend [[Craig Dean]] ([[Guy Burnet]]). The two are seen talking in a pub after Brendan buys John Paul a drink. Later when Ste arrive in Dublin and at Brendan's hotel room - he walks in on John Paul and Brendan after they have sex. Angry and humiliated he storms off but not before arguing with Brendan about why they are not together. Forced to let him go because of his promise to God, heart-broken Brendan watches Ste leave insisting that Brendan 'never has to see him again'.

Later that night, after a phone call from Cheryl insisting that Brendan run after Ste Brendan bumps into a nun. She convinces him that God would forgive him for breaking his promise and Brendan leaves to find Steven. The two finally reunite on [[ha'penny Bridge]] where Brendan finally tells Ste the truth about why he's been staying away from him and the two share mutual &quot;I love you&quot;'s and their reunion kiss. They finally go back to Brendan's hotel room in Dublin.

The next morning Brendan shows Ste around Dublin before the pair arrive at Brendan's dad's old pub. Ste helps pull Brendan out of the dark place the memories of the pub put him in and the pair end up trashing the pub before having sex in it. Once back in Hollyoaks, they're greeted by a happy Cheryl. Unfortunately, their happiness is short lived as Brendan's evil father [[Seamus Brady]] ([[Fintan McKeown]]) who abused him as a child arrives at the Bradys' front door step. Haunted by his father Brendan tries to push Ste away but the pair make it through as Ste insists that Brendan is changing that he will never give up on him. Ste and Brendan then spend Christmas and New Years together with Ste's children Leah and Lucas as Brendan tries to forget about his dad. Seamus decides to stay in the village however and after finding out from Joel that Brendan is gay and in a relationship with Ste he torments Brendan about it until Brendan comes to the decision to have his father murdered.

Brendan offers to buy Joel out of his half of the club if Joel kills Seamus to which Joel eventually begrudgingly agrees. He hits Seamus over the head with a base ball bat and then drags him into an abandoned shed which he sets fire to. At first Brendan is finally at peace with the knowledge that his father is gone but unfortunately Joel's not a very good murderer. As Joel didn't hit him several times with the base ball bat or setting fire to the body instead of the shed Seamus survived. Brendan then punched Joel as revenge and took back the money.

Ste makes Brendan promise that all of his dark side, such as the people after him or the trail of bodies is over. After Joel tries to steal Brendan's money back instead of hurt or kill him, Brendan honors his promise to Ste and lets Joel run away instead. He then sets about building a life with Ste, helping him look after his kids and developing a strong relationship with them to the point where Ste's daughter Leah calls him &quot;daddy Brendan&quot;. Brendan's father however is still a looming presence over their relationship, making several jibs to Brendan regarding his sexuality and emasculation him by calling him 'Brenda'. Ste and Brendan's relationship is tested several times during the next week but they pull through. Doug comes back from America much to Brendan's dismay and would like to continue a working relation with Ste in the deli as well as see Leah and Lucas - to which Ste agrees. With Doug and his father both causing him to melt-down Brendan confides in Mitzeee about his childhood abuse from his father. The former glamour-girl advises him to tell Ste about it or else he'll never get over his past. Ready and intent to tell Ste all about his past Ste turns up at the Hays but overhears a Ste telling Leah that Amy must never know that Brendan and Ste are now together. Distraught, Brendan goes slightly off the rails. Ste and Brendan fight, and Ste tells Brendan that he will not chose between him and his kids because Brendan will lose. Later Brendan ensures that the position of a new barman goes to a hot new guy before preparing to seduce him. Mitzeee quickly makes him see sense before he is able to go through with it and Brendan goes to the deli to make up with Ste.

The pair quickly reunite and Ste inadvertently stops Brendan from telling him about his childhood trauma. Seamus continues being a burden to their relationship though and Ste tells Brendan that he must sort out that relationship. Brendan decides that he doesn't want to stay in the house with Seamus anymore and moves out of his Cheryl's flat. He turns up to Ste's with a bag in hand and the pair move in together. It is later shown that new barman Kevin is in fact working for Walker who is back and set to take revenge on Brendan. He is shown with a beard and going through pictures of Brendan, Ste and Seamus in his home, an abandoned trailer beneath an overpass. After failed attempts to put Brendan away, Kevin is eventually beat up by Walker and forced to accuse Brendan of sexual assault, causing Brendan to be arrested and most of Hollyoaks to turn against him. [[Maxine Minniver]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]), sister of Mitzeee, who Kevin lives with soon discovers that Walker is back, at which point he orders Kevin to kill her. But instead, he continually drugs Maxine and keeps her hidden in their apartment. Eventually, Walker finds out she is still alive and gets Kevin to help him kidnap her and take her to his home. After the first day in court for Brendan's alleged sexual abuse, a depressed Brendan shows up drunk at his sisters engagement party. After being kicked out, Ste tries to take him home when Brendan accuses him of believing he abused Kevin. Ste then lashes out at Brendan and tells him he is just like his father, oblivious to the childhood sexual abuse. Seeing red, Brendan beats Ste five times. When Ste runs away, Maxine bumps into Brendan after Kevin helps her escape from Walker, and tells him that Walker's back.

This takes us into Brendan's final week, also known as Brendan's last dance. Fueled by panic and love, Brendan gets Cheryl into a car and drives her away. During the ride they bump into Ste, at which point Brendan admits to beating him. They take Ste back to his apartment, when he escapes. Brendan goes looking for him and, outside the deli, proclaims his pain and undying love to Ste. He takes him back to the flat, where Cheryl, Ste and Brendan prepare to leave. CHeryl says she won't leave without her father. Brendan goes back to his flat to find Seamus where he finds him tied up with Walker standing over him with a gun.

Walker ties Brendan up with Seamus while he captures Ste and Cheryl, trapping them in his trailer with a limited oxygen supply. When he returns, he forces Brendan to open up about the childhood abuse. He gives Brendan a steel pipe and tells him to kill his father. When Brendan goes to, Seamus apologizes for everything he did. After that, Brendan feels he can't kill him and attacks Walker. Walker escapes and is apprehended by the police. Cheryl and Ste are found by Nate and Darren and Brendan feels he's made progress with his father. Walker, however, escapes the squad car. The next day, the police tell the Bradys that Walker has escaped. Brendan then visits his trailer and sets it alight. Walker, at the graveyard visiting his brother, is found by Texas. He sends her back to Hollyoaks with a message for Brendan to meet him at the church. Brendan finds him on his bike and a car chase ensues. Walker abandons the bike near a viaduct, where Brendan and he fight. Brendan pushes Walker into a moving train, instantly killing him.

Cheryl then notices that the bullets are in her hand and screams to him that the gun isn't loaded. Ste then tries to push past police. Brendan then mutters to himself &quot;In the next life, Stephen.&quot; He then shuts the door to Chez Chez and pulls his gun on police, meaning to be shot dead by police snipers. In the final episode, it is revealed that, while he was shot, it wasn't lethal and is seen in hospital. He and Ste talk before the police drag Brendan away. He tells Stephen that he changed everything. Brendan is then escorted to prison.

A writer for the gay blog and news website ''[[AfterElton.com]]'' expressed his shock at the scene featuring Brendan hitting Ste and also called the story &quot;compelling&quot;. He said, &quot;I must say that even though I've been following this storyline since it began, and I knew what was coming, seeing Brendan hit Ste was quite shocking… and the storyline is just beginning. The show has said it's going to be a dark, long-running story arc so I can only imagine what's ahead. I admit that I find the storyline quite compelling, and I've been drawn into it. While some people have seen this as a romance, it's never played that way to me. Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/gayslives/10-17-2010-hollyoaks-preview?page=0%2C1 |title=&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; Preview: You Sometimes Hurt The One You Love |work=[[AfterElton]] |publisher=(afterelton.com) |first=Anthony D. |last=Langford |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/tv/gayslives/10-20-2010-hollyoaks-update |title=&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; Video Update: Coming Out On Top |work=[[AfterElton]] |publisher=(afterelton.com) |first=Anthony D. |last=Langford |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inside Soap]] writer Laura-Jayne Tyler also praised Scanlan's character: &quot;Ever since the moustache-twitching rogue rocked up in Chester, he's been pure dynamite. His criminal antics are so dodgy that I'm sure he's going to put the likes of Dirty Den to shame, and the gay domestic abuse plot involving him and Ste has got to be the biggest love shock of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/inside-story/brendan-is-best/ |title=Inside Story: Brendan Is Best |work=[[Inside Soap]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Laura-Jayne |last=Tyler |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Deller of [[Lowculture|lowculture.co.uk]] listed Brendan as her favourite character of soap opera during the second half of 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;adf&quot;/&gt; She also commented on him, stating: &quot;Twirling his comedy evil moustache, turning Ste into his sex slave, randomly bullying the weakest residents of the village just because he can, Brendan has made our forum users come over all unnecessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;adf&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2010/12/30/soapstar-superstars-july-december-2010/|title=Soapstar Superstars: July – December 2010|last=Deller|first=Ruth|date=30 December 2010|publisher=[[Lowculture|lowculture.co.uk]]|accessdate=30 December 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vQ5HSnEu|archivedate=1 January 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland &quot;Wee-Bey&quot; Brice''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', played by actor [[Hassan Johnson]]. Wee-Bey is the [[Barksdale Organization]]'s most trusted soldier.

==Character storyline==
Wee-Bey dropped out of school in sixth grade and started dealing drugs on a corner with [[Avon Barksdale]] and [[Stringer Bell]] (both slightly older than he was), eventually becoming the primary soldier in their criminal organization. Wee-Bey was also responsible for more mundane activities including driving and picking up money. Despite his history of violent crime, Wee-Bey is good-natured towards his friends, and has a passion for keeping [[tropical fish]]. He has a son, [[Namond Brice|Namond]], by a woman named [[Barksdale Organization#De'Londa Brice|De'Londa]], though he has no hesitation about sleeping with other women and maintains a separate residence. De'Londa uses his last name although they are not married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/delonda_brice.shtml HBO]&lt;/ref&gt; Wee-Bey has the distinction of being one of the few &quot;street&quot; characters to appear in every season of [[The Wire]], the others being [[Poot (The Wire)|Poot]], [[Proposition Joe]], [[Omar Little]] and [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]].

===Season one===
Wee-Bey is Barksdale's main soldier. When Avon is &quot;cleaning up&quot; any possible trail of evidence leading back to him, Wee-Bey [[Cleaning Up|kills a witness who had previously been bought off]]. Wee-Bey gets involved in two different gun fights with legendary stick-up man [[Omar Little]], after torturing and killing Omar's partner, accomplice and lover [[Omar Little and Associates#Brandon Wright|Brandon]]. Their first encounter ends with Wee-Bey being shot in the leg, but he later defends Avon against Omar, shooting him in the shoulder and forcing him to retreat. Wee-Bey is noted as having the distinction of being the only character in the Wire to get the better of Omar in a one-to-one gunfight.

Wee-Bey was also linked to the body of a dancer from Orlando's strip club, a Barksdale [[Front organization|front company]]. Although not responsible for her death, he slept with her the evening before and showed little concern after she died from a drug overdose. His callous disposal of her body leads [[Barksdale_Organization#Shardene_Innes|another stripper]] to give information to the police.

Wee-Bey's eventual downfall comes when he and [[Barksdale Organization#Little Man|Little Man]] kill [[Barksdale Organization#Wendell &quot;Orlando&quot; Blocker|Orlando]], who was working as a police informant. During the killing, Little Man shoots and critically wounds the undercover [[Kima Greggs]], in the car with Orlando. Wee-Bey is stunned to learn that the second shooting victim was an undercover cop. Stringer orders Wee-Bey to kill Little Man, stating that he is unreliable as a soldier, and flee town; [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] is responsible for driving Wee-Bey to [[Philadelphia]] (and taking care of his fish). When D'Angelo is arrested soon after, he gives the police information concerning Wee-Bey's whereabouts and his murder of Deirdre Kresson, a former girlfriend of Avon's.  Later, through a combination of the active wiretap and phone records, the police are able to determine Wee-Bey's exact location. Baltimore and Philadelphia police arrest Wee-Bey by activating his car alarm, luring him out of his residence without his gun.  Once in custody, and guaranteed a life sentence for his involvement in Kima's shooting, Wee-Bey confesses to numerous murders, including several he did not commit (with the aim of protecting other people in the [[Barksdale Organization]]); in return he asks for a [[Culture of Baltimore#Pit Beef|pit beef]] sandwich with extra [[horseradish]].

===Season two===
Wee-Bey is imprisoned with Avon, serving life without parole. He keeps artificial fish in his cell and enjoys a relatively easy life under Barksdale's protection. A correctional officer named [[Law_enforcement_characters_of_The_Wire#Dwight_Tilghman|Dwight Tilghman]] harasses him because he confessed to murdering a relative of Tilghman's. Wee-Bey complains to Avon. Avon and Stringer resolve the problem by arranging for Tilghman to smuggle tainted drugs into the prison. When the bad drugs kill several inmates, Avon comes forward as an &quot;informant&quot; and implicates Tilghman as the culprit.  Later on, after D'Angelo is murdered, Wee-Bey reassures Avon that D'Angelo's death was not his fault.

===Season three===
Wee-Bey appears only briefly, helping Avon approach [[Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise]] to offer him a position. 

===Season four===
Wee-Bey's [[Namond Brice|teenage son]] becomes involved with the drug trade, getting a job with his old colleague [[Bodie Broadus]]. Namond is also responsible for his fish. De'Londa and Namond visit Wee-Bey regularly and Wee-Bey gives Namond advice on life, especially about surviving on the streets. When [[Brianna Barksdale]] cuts off the monthly payments that the Barksdale organization had been making to the Brices, Namond is further pressured into dealing, mainly by his mother De'Londa. [[Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin]] takes a liking to Namond after meeting him in a special program for troubled youth that Colvin helped supervise. Seeing potential in the boy, Colvin approaches Wee-Bey and asks his permission to take Namond into his home. Colvin tells Wee-Bey that the changing face of the drug trade and Namond's capabilities in other areas make him better suited to a life off the streets. Though initially reluctant, Wee-Bey agrees that Colvin's offer gives Namond the best chance of escaping the drug trade and making something of himself. Acknowledging that anything would be preferable to a life as a soldier, Wee-Bey orders De'Londa to allow Colvin to assume guardianship of Namond, implicitly threatening her when she appears reluctant to let Namond go.

===Season five===
Wee-Bey is briefly seen during the end-of-season montage conversing amicably with [[Chris Partlow]] in the courtyard of the Maryland State prison; they are in a similar situation, both having been primary enforcers for West Baltimore kingpins, and now both serving life sentences for committing (and taking sole responsibility for) murders at the behest of their respective bosses.

==Real life origins==
[[Ed Burns]] investigated several high-end drug traffickers in the 1980s.  One of these was a heroin dealer named Thomas H. Taylor, whose partner, Vernon Collins, was known as Bey-Brother.  He was described by one FBI informant as a &quot;narcotics hit man who is feared throughout the narcotics underworld in Baltimore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/857/857.F2d.210.88-5503.88-5502.html&lt;/ref&gt; Collins is mentioned in [[David Simon (writer)|David Simon]]'s book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'' as one of [[Baltimore]]'s notorious contract killers in the late 1970s along with Dennis Wise (who spawned a [[Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise|character of the same name]] played by actor [[Chad Coleman]].)  Wee-Bey is a reference to this hit man and drug trafficker.  Collins was arrested in 1987 and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison.

'''Preston''' &quot;'''Bodie'''&quot; '''Broadus''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', played by actor [[J. D. Williams]]. Bodie is initially a rough, low-level drug dealer, but matures throughout the series and slowly rises through the ranks. Bodie is an intelligent and disciplined lieutenant, showing strong loyalty to the [[Barksdale Organization]] even after most of its members get imprisoned or killed. Bodie is a relatively goodhearted character who sticks to his principles, but at times he can be violent, such as when he takes part in the murder of a friend and fellow dealer on orders from [[Stringer Bell]]. His relationship with the police is also dynamic. He is initially hostile towards all police, but eventually earns the respect of Officer [[Jimmy McNulty]].

==Biography==
Preston &quot;Bodie&quot; Broadus was raised by his grandmother after his mother fell into addiction and homelessness, dying when he was four years old. Bodie's grandmother says that when she took him in, &quot;he was only four, but even then, I knew he was angry.&quot; He began working with [[Barksdale Organization|the Barksdales]] at age 13. His older brother James was also a gangster, but was killed early in Bodie's life, depriving him of immediate familial support.

===Season one===
Bodie, aged 16, worked under [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] in the low-rise projects known as &quot;The Pit&quot;, with his friends [[Poot (The Wire)|Poot]] and [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]]. He was a more prominent member of the area, and was also more openly violent and hostile than his peers. This caused Bodie to chafe under D'Angelo's soft style of leadership and lead him to sometimes challenge his authority. When The Pit's stash was robbed, he made a positive impression on [[Stringer Bell]] by noticing the name of the stick-up artist, [[Omar Little]], and describing the van.

Bodie often displayed a quick, violent temper; he instigated the severe beating of drug addict [[Street level characters of The Wire#Johnny Weeks|Johnny Weeks]] after he buys heroin from them with fake money. In a later conversation in which D'Angelo tries to emphasize decent treatment of the customers, Bodie is unsympathetic; this is perhaps because of his mother's addiction-fueled negligence while she was still alive. Later, Bodie punched Detective [[Police of The Wire#Patrick Mahon|Mahon]] while being searched. Bodie received a beating for this, from Detectives Hauk, [[Kima Greggs|Greggs]] and [[Ellis Carver|Carver]]. He was arrested, but almost immediately after arriving at a juvenile detention facility, he walked out, stole a car, and was soon back in Baltimore dealing again. He became a personal target of Herc and Carver, who picked him up in the pit and gave him a second beating. However, while waiting for prisoner transfer, they softened towards him over a game of pool. The Barksdale Organization's lawyer, [[Maurice Levy (The Wire)|Maurice Levy]], soon convinced a judge to release Bodie. Herc and Carver were incredulous at this, but when they realized he had legitimately beaten the charges against him (thanks to Levy), they relented.

Later, Bodie was tasked by [[Stringer Bell]] to murder his erstwhile friend Wallace after [[Avon Barksdale]] decided to eliminate anyone who might talk to the police. Bodie's willingness to carry out the hit further impressed Stringer. He gathered Poot with little hesitation to aid him in his job. During the lead up to the hit, Bodie was the more confident of the two; however, when they cornered a fearful Wallace, who pleaded with his friends, Bodie showed much hesitation. Only after Poot told him to finish it did he pull the trigger. Poot then takes the gun and finishes Wallace off. After the arrest of his one-time mentor and crew chief D'Angelo, Bodie's leadership skills shone and he stepped into the position by gathering The Pit's members to physically force away a rival drug gang.

===Season two===
Stringer began entrusting Bodie with more difficult tasks, such as picking up the main supply in [[Philadelphia]], and assigned him one of the prized Franklin Terrace Towers to run. Poot was assigned to run the pit and he reported to Bodie. They faced problems with poor quality product because the Barksdales' favored [[New York City]] suppliers severed ties following Avon's arrest. Bodie came up with considered suggestions to work around the problem at Stringer's meetings. When Stringer enters a deal with [[Proposition Joe]], to give away some of Barksdale territory for Proposition's Joe's superior heroin, Bodie tries to find new territory and steals it from another crew. This results in the other crew starting a gunfight which resulted in the accidental death of a child. After failing to adequately dispose of the guns, Bodie was picked up and interrogated by detectives [[Police of The Wire#Ed Norris|Ed Norris]] and [[Police of The Wire#Ray Cole|Ray Cole]] in connection with the crime. They attempted to bluff a confession out of him, but he saw through their trick and was released.

===Season three===
The Franklin Towers were demolished and Avon Barksdale was released from prison. Western District Major [[Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin|Colvin]] tried to deal with the spread of the drug problem by offering &quot;drug zones&quot; where dealers and users would go unpunished. Bodie worked in one such zone nicknamed &quot;Hamsterdam&quot;; this brought him back into contact with Herc and Carver, now working in the Western District. When the police made their inevitable move on shutting down the free zones, Detectives [[Jimmy McNulty|McNulty]] and Greggs tried to arrest Bodie for possession. Bodie, having already once been stopped but quickly released by McNulty on his way into Hamsterdam, displayed his characteristically sharp mind during interrogation and cited entrapment (or &quot;contrapment&quot; as he mistakenly put it) leading to wrongful arrest, leaving an impressed McNulty and [[Rhonda Pearlman|Pearlman]] no choice but to let him go. He also helped [[Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise]] to contact Avon Barksdale on several occasions; the two appear to have a rapport and mutual respect most likely derived from Cutty having known Bodie's older brother.

The Barksdale organization became embroiled in a turf war with [[Marlo Stanfield]]'s crew. Although Bodie's crew was badly beaten, Bodie himself was not present at the time of the assault. The escalating murder rate brought further police attention. Avon was sent back to prison, Stringer was murdered and the gang was scattered. Bodie was one of the few prominent Barksdale members not present at the home-base, which spared him from the weapons charges.

===Season four===
Bodie was forced onto a less-desirable corner due to the Stanfield Organization's complete control of what used to be the Barksdale Organization's territories. His newest crew included his second in command Curtis &quot;Lex&quot; Anderson, [[Stanfield_Organization#Little_Kevin|Little Kevin]] and Reesy; he employed [[Namond Brice]] as a runner out of respect for [[Wee-Bey Brice|his father]]'s reputation, despite Namond's poor attitude and lack of street skills. He tried to tempt [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael Lee]], a far more effective runner, to take a permanent position at his corner, but Michael declined. Bodie's experience and intelligence allowed him to build up a solid business in his out of way corner, even with a lack of muscle and experienced support, as he only was able to hire younger dealers and inexperienced students like Namond. He continued to have dealings with Sergeant Carver and Officer McNulty, since his operation fell within their jurisdiction, and was considered a source of information for the two; this was shown most when they immediately came to him in confidence after Lex's disappearance. After being released from prison mid-way through the season, Bodie's oldest surviving colleague Poot returned and helped Bodie by working on his corner.  

Bodie was supplied quality product by ex-Barksdale enforcer [[New Day Co-Op#Slim Charles|Slim Charles]], now working for Proposition Joe. Slim's connections and support helped Bodie build his corner into a good drug market. [[Chris Partlow]] and Marlo noticed this and offered Bodie an ultimatum: let Marlo's operation take over the corner by force, or remain but work Marlo's less profitable heroin package. Bodie had no muscle in his crew, and even after seeking out Slim Charles was still enraged to submit. He ultimately agrees to selling the package offered by Marlo after realizing that he would receive no support in defying Marlo.

In a fit of romantic jealousy, Bodie's subordinate, Lex murdered his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend: a Stanfield dealer known as [[Stanfield Organization#Fruit|Fruit]]. In retribution, Stanfield enforcers [[Chris Partlow|Chris]] and [[Snoop (The Wire)|Snoop]] executed Lex, in an ambush he was lured into by his co-worker Little Kevin. Little Kevin in turn was executed by the pair weeks later because of his failure to follow directions to the letter. Bodie felt that Marlo was violating the rules of the drug trade, yet he was unaware of Little Kevin's betrayal of Lex. He sought Poot for advice on the matter, but his old colleague disagreed with his resistant stance, saying when they killed Wallace, it was just as unjustified. Bodie however remained certain that Wallace's death was necessary, as it involved betrayal, whereas Marlo's murders were on the basis of ruthless killings. After Little Kevin's body was discovered, Bodie was arrested for kicking in the windows of a police car in rage; he was responsible for advising Little Kevin to go see Marlo after the latter asked for his audience. He was released on the recommendation of McNulty, who hoped to turn Bodie as an informant against Marlo. Bodie expressed resistance to giving information on his former Barksdale allies, but was eager to talk about Marlo's crew. McNulty had an increasing respect for Bodie which had been developing since Season 1; this and their unified hatred of everything Marlo had done ultimately convinced Bodie that he needed to step up in order to stop the wave of ruthless murder that Marlo had been causing.

Bodie was seen getting into McNulty's car by [[Stanfield Organization#&quot;Monk&quot; Metcalf|Monk]], one of Marlo's lieutenants, who later relayed this information to Marlo, who swiftly ordered his death. Later that night, Bodie is dealing with Poot and Spider when Chris and Snoop set up an ambush. Bodie decides to take a [[last stand]], causing an unarmed Spider to retreat. Throughout the fourth season, Chris and Snoop murder various people by taking them into abandoned houses. All of the victims put up a minimal fight and are dispatched with ease. Bodie decides to be the sole exception to this and shouts &quot;you ain't putting me in one of them empty ass houses neither&quot;. Poot tries to reason with Bodie but Bodie shakes his head, realizing that he is ready to die for what he believes in. After Poot realizes he cannot convince him otherwise, he retreats. Shortly after Poot's departure, while Bodie is still focused on Chris and Snoop, O-Dog emerges from a doorway behind Bodie and shoots him twice in the head, killing him. When McNulty later asks Poot who had killed Bodie, Poot stated that &quot;Y'all did&quot;, (meaning the police, not McNulty himself), as it happened after Marlo's lieutenant saw Bodie getting into a police car outside the station.

McNulty, having developed a genuine respect for Bodie throughout the season, is stricken with guilt. Bodie's death is what ultimately convinces McNulty to return to the Major Crime Unit, as he wishes to catch Marlo and end his violent ways.

Judging by his age at the start of the series, Bodie was around 20 years old when he was killed.

'''Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Brody''', played by actor [[Damian Lewis]], is a [[fictional character]] on the American television series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], created by [[Alex Gansa]] and [[Howard Gordon]]. Brody was a [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Sergeant]] who was held as a [[prisoner of war]] by [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists for eight years. Following his rescue and return home, Brody is hailed as a war hero. However, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, [[Carrie Mathison]], suspects that Brody was turned by al-Qaeda, and tries to stop him from potentially committing a terrorist act. Between the first and second season, he was elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]]. In the third season, he was executed by Iranian authorities after completing a CIA plot against the Iranian [[Army_of_the_Guardians_of_the_Islamic_Revolution|Revolutionary Guard]].

==Character biography==
===Background and personality===
Brody was a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper|Scout Sniper]] who deployed during the [[Iraq War]]. On May 19, 2003, both Brody and a fellow Scout Sniper, Thomas Walker ([[Chris Chalk]]), were captured near the [[Syria|Syrian]] border by forces loyal to [[Saddam Hussein]]. The two men were sold to [[al-Qaeda]] commander Abu Nazir ([[Navid Negahban]]) and held captive in [[Damascus]] for the next eight years. Brody's guards tortured him for much of his captivity, but Nazir treated him with kindness in order to gain his trust. Brody converted to [[Islam]] while in captivity. Under Nazir's direction, Brody severely beat Walker and believed he had killed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;pilot&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep1|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 2, 2011|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazir ended Brody's torture in 2008 and invited him into his home, asking him to teach his son Issa [[English language|English]]. Brody soon grew to love the boy as his own son. In 2009, however, Issa was killed in a [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] strike while attending school. Brody helped Nazir bury Issa and joined him in reciting an [[Islamic prayer]] over the child's grave. Shortly thereafter, Brody watched an interview with [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] William Walden ([[Jamey Sheridan]]), who falsely claimed that no children were killed in the drone strike. Brody swore revenge on Walden and agreed to kill him in a [[suicide attack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;crossfire&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Crossfire|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep9|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 27, 2011|season=1|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 1===
{{See also|Homeland (season 1)}}

Brody is rescued by [[Delta Force]] troops during a raid on a terrorist compound in [[Afghanistan]]. He is flown back to the U.S., where he is reunited with his wife, Jessica ([[Morena Baccarin]]), and his children, Dana ([[Morgan Saylor]]) and Chris ([[Jackson Pace]]). He also meets Walden during a press conference at [[Andrews Air Force Base]]. During his [[debriefing]], Brody finds himself interrogated by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer [[Carrie Mathison]] ([[Claire Danes]]), who was previously told by an informant that an American POW had been turned by al-Qaeda. However, the interrogation is stopped by Carrie's superior, [[Counterterrorism Center]] director David Estes ([[David Harewood]]). Even so, Carrie sets up a slipshod intelligence operation and bugs Brody's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;pilot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As he settles back into civilian life, Brody  struggles with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and has nightmares about his captivity in Damascus, all of which takes a toll on his family. The situation is worsened when he finds out that Jessica and Mike Faber ([[Diego Klattenhoff]]), his best friend and fellow Marine, had been in a relationship while he was in captivity. Brody initially shuns the spotlight, physically assaulting a reporter who enters his backyard. He also rebuffs a suggestion from Faber that he re-enlist in the Marine Corps and seek a promotion. However, Brody eventually changes his mind and addresses the press in full uniform outside of his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Grace|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep2|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 9, 2011|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrie watches Brody's TV appearances and notices that he taps his fingers in a repeated pattern, believing that he is giving a [[Code|coded message]]. This observation convinces her CIA mentor, Saul Berenson ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), to help her obtain a technically legal [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA warrant]] for Brody's home. Carrie continues surveilling Brody after her warrant expires and breaches CIA protocol by approaching him at a support group for veterans. They bond immediately over their shared experiences in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Semper I|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep4|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 23, 2011|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eventually embark on a sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Good Soldier|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep6|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 6, 2011|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brody considers leaving Jessica for Carrie until he figures out that Carrie suspects him of being a terrorist. After it is revealed that Walker is alive and also turned, Brody angrily rejects Carrie and goes back to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Weekend|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep7|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 13, 2011|season=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tells his [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] contact, Monsour Al-Zahrani (Ramsey Faragallah), to tell Nazir that he will not go through with their planned attack &amp;ndash; a suicide bombing at a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] policy summit that he and Walden will be attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Achilles Heel|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep8|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 20, 2011|season=1|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Brody reconsiders and records a suicide video, intending for it to be released after his attack. The video is collected in a drop by Nazir's men.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossfire&quot; /&gt;

Brody retrieves a bomb vest from one of Nazir's men and prepares to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Vest|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep11|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 11, 2011|season=1|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Walker opens fire on the summit, Brody and his targets are sent to a safe room inside the State Department. As Brody prepares to detonate the vest, however, he finds that it does not work. After he fixes it in a restroom, Dana calls and asks him to promise he will come home; unbeknownst to Brody, Carrie had shown up at his house and told Dana what he was about to do. Brody decides not to detonate the bomb and later kills Walker to reassure Nazir of his loyalty. He tells Nazir via phone that he plans to run for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], which will allow him to influence the U.S. military as a [[double agent]]. He then tells Carrie, who has been fired from the CIA, to leave him and his family alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Marine One|episodelink=Homeland (season 1)#ep12|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 18, 2011|season=1|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
{{See also|Homeland (season 2)}}
Six months after the State Department attack, Brody has been elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], representing [[Virginia's 7th congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Smile|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep1|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=September 30, 2012|season=2|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walden approaches Brody and offers to tap him as his running mate during his planned presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Beirut is Back|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep2|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 7, 2012|season=2|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Brody meets Roya Hammad ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]), a journalist who gives an assignment from Nazir instructing him to retrieve a list of potential attack targets from a safe in Estes' office. Despite his initial reluctance, Brody procures the list. Roya tells him to help an al-Qaeda bomb maker get to a safe house, but Brody ends up killing the man when he tries to escape. The incident causes him to miss a speaking engagement that Jessica had arranged for him. When he returns home, she tells him that she has had enough of his lies and that she is no longer sure of their marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=State of Independence|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep3|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 14, 2012|season=2|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dana admits at school that her father is a Muslim, an angered Jessica confronts Brody and throws his [[Quran]] to the floor. Later, Dana helps Brody bury the desecrated Quran. Meanwhile, Berenson finds Brody's suicide tape in [[Beirut]] and gives it to Estes. Carrie is reinstated, and an operation is set up to monitor Brody's actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They meet in a hotel bar, where she intuits that he is on to her and arrests him.&lt;ref name=&quot;newcarsmell&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Smile|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep4|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 21, 2012|season=2|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing interrogation, new team leader Peter Quinn ([[Rupert Friend]]) stabs Brody in the hand. Carrie takes over, and convinces Brody to become a [[triple agent]] for the CIA. Brody uses this as an excuse for his strange behavior to Jessica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Q&amp;Q|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep5|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 28, 2012|season=2|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana is involved in a fatal [[hit and run]] committed by Walden's son Finn ([[Timothée Chalamet]]), her new boyfriend.&lt;ref name=&quot;newcarsmell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brody takes Dana to the police department to report it. Carrie stops him, stating it will affect his cover. Angered, Dana runs away and goes to stay with Faber, who by now has discovered that Brody killed Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Clearing|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep7|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 11, 2012|season=2|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie tells Faber to stop his investigation into Walker's death, which he reluctantly does. Under pressure, Brody meets Hammad and says he wants out of the plot. During a tryst at a hotel, Carrie convinces Brody to return to Nazir so they can prevent his next attack. During a rendezvous with Hammad the next morning, Brody is taken away in a helicopter. In a warehouse, he is confronted by Nazir and reaffirms his loyalty as part of his cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=I'll Fly Away|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep8|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 18, 2012|season=2|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brody makes good on his pledge to help stop Nazir's attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Two Hats|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep9|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 25, 2012|season=2|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, he receives a call from Nazir, who is holding Carrie hostage; he threatens to kill her unless Brody helps him kill Walden. Brody goes to Walden's office and texts Nazir the serial number of Walden's [[pacemaker]] so Nazir can remotely tamper with it. Brody then demands that Nazir let Carrie go, which he does. As Brody meets with Walden and tells him he cannot accept a place on the ticket, Nazir causes Walden's pacemaker to malfunction. Brody refuses to call an ambulance and taunts Walden as he dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Broken Hearts|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep10|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 2, 2012|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, after learning that Nazir has been killed, Brody leaves Jessica and reunites with Carrie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=In Memoriam|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep11|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 9, 2012|season=2|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dana finds Brody's explosive vest and asks him if he had been planning to use it; he replies that he changed his mind. He goes to Walden's funeral with Carrie, who tells him that she has decided to leave the CIA and be with him. Just then, however, a bomb hidden in Brody's car detonates and kills 200 of the funeral's attendees, including Walden's family and many CIA agents and government officials. Brody realizes that Nazir had planned the attack in advance of his own death and reassures Carrie that he had nothing to do with it. As she smuggles him into [[Canada]], al-Qaeda airs his suicide tape, and he is branded as the mastermind of the attack. At the border, Brody and Carrie tearfully part ways, with Carrie promising to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Choice|episodelink=Homeland (season 2)#ep12|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 16, 2012|season=2|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the Langley bombing, Brody becomes one of the most wanted fugitives in the world. In [[Caracas, Venezuela]], he is shot twice and nearly dies before he is found by a group of drug dealers. They take him to a drug house, where Dr. Graham ([[Erik Dellums]]), an underground surgeon, saves his life. When Brody recovers, he asks the head of the drug ring, El Niño ([[Manny Pérez]]), why he is protecting him; El Niño replies that he knows Carrie. Anxious to keep moving, Brody convinces El Niño's daughter, Esme (Martina García), to take him outside. He approaches an [[imam]] and asks to be given sanctuary in a [[mosque]]. Instead, the imam reports Brody to the police. El Niño and his men arrive and kill the incoming police force, as well as the imam and his wife. El Niño tells Brody that he will spend the rest of his life in the drug house. Despondent, Brody injects [[heroin]] into his arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Tower of David|episodelink=Homeland (season 3)#ep3|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=October 13, 2013|season=3|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saul goes to Caracas and finds Brody in a heroin-induced stupor. Brody is taken back to the U.S. and weaned off of the drugs with [[ibogaine]]. Berenson and Carrie offer Brody a chance to redeem himself by seeking [[political asylum]] in [[Iran]] and assassinating the head of the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guard]], General Danesh Akbari (Houshang Touzie), so that CIA asset Majid Javadi ([[Shaun Toub]]) can take his place. Brody refuses, saying he wants to die. Carrie takes Brody to a motel where Dana is working as a maid but does not let him see her; she says that he must first atone for what he has done by taking part in the operation. Brody undergoes 16 days of rigorous [[Special Operations]] training, until he is once again in peak physical condition. On the night he is set to ship off to [[Tehran]], Brody asks Carrie to take him to see Dana. He tells Dana he is innocent, but she replies that she never wants to see him again. As he gets ready to depart, Brody pledges that he will survive the mission and return for Dana and Carrie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=One Last Thing|episodelink=Homeland (season 3)#ep9|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=November 24, 2013|season=3|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Special Ops soldiers drives Brody to the Iranian border, where they are stopped by [[Iraqi Police|Iraqi police]]; when of the officers recognizes Brody, the soldiers are forced to open fire. Brody panics and tries to run, but team leader Azzizi ([[Donnie Keshawarz]]) calms him down. Moments later, they hit a land mine, severely injuring Azzizi and attracting enemy fire. From Langley, Saul calls off the mission, but Brody is determined to cross the border. Carrie tries to dissuade him, saying that he will die if he goes in alone; Brody replies that she will have to think of a way to get him out safely. He identifies himself to the Iranian border guards and asks for asylum as planned, and the guards take him and one of the soldiers, Turani (Jared Ward), into custody. They are met by Javadi, who kills Turani in front of a horrified Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Good Night|episodelink=Homeland (season 3)#ep10|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 1, 2013|season=3|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three days of interrogation, Brody is taken to meet Akbari, secretly armed with a [[cyanide]]-filled syringe. Akbari does not get close enough for Brody to inject him, however, and has his men send Brody to Nazir's widow Nasrin (Naz Deravian) to vet his propaganda value. Over the next few days, Brody gives a series of interviews on Iranian television denouncing the United States, leaving Saul no choice but to order his death. Carrie calls Brody, warns him that he is in danger, and pleads with him to come with her. Brody refuses, however, instead going to see Akbari and telling him about the CIA's plan. Once he has Akbari's trust, Brody overpowers and suffocates him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Big Man in Tehran|episodelink=Homeland (season 3)#ep11|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 8, 2013|season=3|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brody escapes with Carrie to a safe house, where she tells him she is pregnant with his child. Moments later, Javadi's men arrive and take Brody into custody, part of a deal the CIA made with Javadi to help him advance to greater power within the Iranian government. Brody is found guilty of [[treason]] and [[capital punishment in Iran|sentenced to death]]. Carrie calls him in his cell to reassure him that she will save him, but he replies that he has accepted his fate and just wants it to be over. The next morning, Brody is hanged in a public square as Carrie tearfully looks on.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=The Star|episodelink=Homeland (season 3)#ep12|series=Homeland|serieslink=Homeland|network=Showtime|airdate=December 15, 2013|season=2|number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months later, Carrie &amp;mdash; who has decided to keep Brody's child &amp;mdash; tries unsuccessfully to persuade new CIA Director Andrew Lockhart ([[Tracy Letts]]) to give Brody a star on the [[CIA Memorial Wall]]. She later draws a star for him with a marker pen.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shirley Paul Browning''' (commonly known as '''Doctor Browning''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by Joseph Thompson. He made his debut screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 2012 and was introduced by [[Emma Smithwick]]. Doctor Browning was introduced as part of a storyline featuring [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) in which he &quot;shows her the benefits of 'selling her services'&quot;. Doctor Browning and Mercedes later begin a relationship, which Smithwick called a &quot;union of the dark soul mates&quot;. Thompson said that Doctor Browning and Mercedes &quot;are excited by how dangerous the other is&quot; and are &quot;kindred spirits&quot; who have an &quot;undeniable connection between them&quot;. When [[Lynsey Nolan]] ([[Karen Hassan]]) is murdered in a [[whodunnit]] plot Doctor Browning becomes a suspect before it is later revealed he had killed Lynsey. Doctor Browning is described as having an &quot;incredible capacity for Sleaze&quot; and as someone who &quot;needs to be in control and is not afraid to use underhand tactics&quot;.

Thompson was nominated in the &quot;Newcomer&quot; category at the 2013 [[National Television Awards]]. Laura Morgan of ''[[All About Soap]]'' felt that Doctor Browning was an &quot;obvious suspect&quot; in the investigation for Lynsey's murder although ''[[Inside Soap]]'' journalist Sarah was shocked at the revelation of Doctor Browning as Lynsey's killer, saying she had overlooked him as a suspect. Anthony D. Langford from [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton]] hoped that the character would not be revealed to be Lynsey's killer due to his enjoyment of Doctor Browning's relationship with Mercedes and their &quot;blistering chemistry&quot;. Thompson's departure was announced on 9 August 2013 and the character left on 16 October 2013 after killed by Mercedes following showdown with Mercedes, [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) and [[Lindsey Butterfield]] ([[Sophie Austin]]) at part of the show's 18th anniversary.

Metcalfe commented that Mercedes begins to think he could provide her with the [[WAGs|WAG]] lifestyle she has always wanted. She added that Mercedes still wants Riley but she &quot;craves a bit of danger&quot;.&lt;ref name=tvtimes /&gt; Thompson also commented on this, saying Doctor Browning offers an &quot;exciting alternative&quot; for Mercedes compared to Riley. On the relationship Thompson said: &quot;He knows what makes her tick, and the two of them are excited by how dangerous the other is&quot;. He went on to explain that Doctor Browning initially agreed to pretend to be in a relationship with Mercedes to help make Riley jealous but &quot;he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around&quot;.&lt;ref name=insidesoap /&gt; When Doctor Browning sees Riley kiss Mercedes &quot;it becomes a question of how much he can take&quot; and he decides he must &quot;make a quick move&quot; to prevent them reuniting. He takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she &quot;realises there's an undeniable connection between them&quot;. He added that the couple are &quot;kindred spirits&quot; and Mercedes spending time with him will make her rethink their relationship.&lt;ref name=insidesoap /&gt; To dissuade Riley from reuniting with Mercedes, Doctor Browning gets Riley intoxicated and then warns him off of Mercedes.

Mercedes reunites with Riley who cheats on her with Mitzeee, leading to Mercedes kidnapping her and Riley's son in revenge. Mercedes is arrested and shortly after Riley is shot dead. At her trial, Doctor Browning is called forward as a witness when her lawyer [[Jim McGinn]] ([[Dan Tetsell]]) blames Riley for Mercedes' actions, claiming he abused her so she prevented Riley from seeing their son to protect him. Doctor Browning arrives for the trial where he claims Riley was also responsible for killing Lynsey.

==Storylines==
Doctor Browning pays Mercedes for sex and asks to keep seeing her and gives her more money. When Lynsey resuscitates a [[Do not resuscitate|DNR]] patient; Doctor Browning tells her that the department are investigating the incident, he admits he forgot to write the patient's DNR request on their notes. He threatens to report Lynsey and Mercedes tries to convince him not to. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens to tell his wife of their relationship if Doctor Browning reports Lynsey for resuscitating the DNR patient. He later promises not to report Lynsey who is later given her job back as a nurse. Mercedes later calls Doctor Browning and arranges a meeting. She sleeps with him again for money and the next day he goads Lynsey about it. She warns him to stay away from her because Mercedes is not well and accuses him of taking advangtage. He later treats [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) for her burn injuries and catches Lynsey attempting to view [[Simon Walker (Hollyoaks)|Walker]]'s ([[Neil Newbon]]) medical records.

After discharging Mercedes from hospital, Lynsey is found dead and Doctor Browning confirms her time of death. He forges Mercedes' discharge papers so it appears as though she left hospital after Lynsey's murder. He moves into the flat next door to [[Riley Costello]] (Rob Norbury) to be closer to Mercedes. He blackmails Mercedes with the papers and tells her that she can make Riley jealous if they pretend to be in a relationship. His wife, Helen Browning, visits Mercedes and warns her that Doctor Browning will ruin her life. She has a black eye and Mercedes uses this to give Riley the impression that Doctor Browning has been hitting her. He tells Riley that Mercedes is lying and she leaves him. Doctor Browning finds Mercedes and they share their secrets about bad deeds. He tells her that he loves her no matter what she has done and they become closer. [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) discovers Lynsey's scarf in his office desk and assumes that he is the killer. It is later revealed that Doctor Browning went to threaten Lynsey into keeping quiet about Mercedes stalking Mitzeee. They argued and he strangled her, not knowing that Walker was watching. When Mercedes finds out the truth, Doctor Browning kidnaps her and drives off. He suggests that they go abroad and Mercedes agrees, but the police arrive and arrest him. At the trial for Lynsey's murder Doctor Browning pleads not guilty and is later acquitted when he blames Riley for Lynsey's murder, after Riley's death. Doctor Browning surprises Mercedes on Christmas Eve and spends Christmas with Mercedes' family. Mercedes is thrown out by her family and Doctor Browning proposes marriage to her which she accepts. When Mercedes' mother, [[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) begins feeling ill, Doctor Browning suggests she come and see him at the hospital as she may have a serious illness. He carries out some scans on her and switches her results with another patient so it appears as if she has cancer. Doctor Browning suggests that Myra may not have long to live so should remain close to her family and make up with Mercedes.

When he tells Myra that she's not going to die, [[Jim McGinn]] ([[Dan Tetsell]]), a lawyer, suggests that Myra could sue and get a lot of money. When Doctor Browning hears this he asks his boss if he'd make sure he didn't get fired in exchange for anything. His boss, Davies, says that he'll make sure nothing happens to Doctor Browning in exchange for one night with Mercedes. Doctor Browning says that that was a ridiculous idea, but when Mercedes finds out, she tells Doctor Browning that she'll do it, but then stop dating Doctor Browning.

When Mercedes goes, she decides to video everything that happens, but Davies finds out and proceeds to try and rape her but Dr Browning saves her. In 2013 When [[Clare Devine]] ([[Gemma Bissix]] kidnaps Mercedes, Dr Browning finds Clare and tries to strangle her in her hotel but Jim turns up and saves her. When finding out where Mercedes is, he tries to save her but gets knocked unconscious with a rock by Clare who locks him in the cage with her but when Clare is arrested they are saved by the police. He then proposes to Mercedes. After the events a new doctor appears called [[Lindsey Butterfield]] (Sophie Austin) which infuriates him because he killed Lynsey and that reminded him of her name. He begins stalking her which makes Mercedes think that he is having an affair with her.

On their wedding day Mercedes confronts Lindsey accusing her of having an affair with Paul which leads to a fist fight which has to be broken up by Browning. Paul grabs Lindsey off Mercedes so her husband [[Joe Roscoe]] (Ayden Callaghan) Punches him after he thinks he is attacking Lindsey. After the events Mercedes and Paul finally get married. Days after the wedding Paul begins stalking Lindsey again and locks himself in a lift with her and tries to rape her but Lindsey knocks him over and runs away. He then has a one-night stand with [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]) and after she threatens to tell Mercedes he tries to kill her in the Hollyoaks high school storeroom but she survives and recovers.

When [[Myra Mcqueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) tries to split up Paul and Mercedes, he hires [[Trevor Royle]] ([[Greg Wood (actor)|Greg Wood]]) to kill her but he fails and she survives which angers Browning. Myra suspects he is behind it and tells everyone that he is a murderer and puts up posters that he is a murderer so Paul and Trevor agree to kill her. However, when Jim finds out he plans to help her escape. Mercedes learns of the plan and goes along with it. Mercedes gets a gun and points it at Dr Browning but he overpowers her and locks her in the bathroom and takes the gun. Trevor goes to kill Myra but Jim helps her escape so Paul goes to kill her. He finds her by a [[dock (maritime)|dock]] and shoots her into the water just before Jim comes to take her away. It is then revealed that she survived because Jim gave her a bullet proof vest then she decides to go live in Spain so Browning goes to prison. When he gets home he tells Mercedes he killed Myra so Mercedes reluctantly agrees that she deserved it until they get to the loft and Mercedes attacks Paul. Paul manages to overpower her and tries to kill her until Jim interrupts and he is arrested. He tells Trevor he killed Myra and he confesses to the murders of Lynsey and Myra and the attempted murder of Cindy and attempted rape of Lindsey.

In October Paul escapes from prison and when Mercedes finds out she ignores the fact that he has and carries on with her life however when [[Fraser Black]] ([[Jesse Birsdall]]) and Jim get Clare out of prison, Clare plants a bomb in the loft where Mercedes is having her party. On her birthday Trevor, who is carrying the bomb, puts money in an identical bag and [[Sinead O'Connor]] ([[Stephanie Davis (actress)|Stephanie Davis]]) takes the bag with the bomb believing it was the bag with the money in to [[Doug Carter]]) and [[Ste Hay]]'s ([[Kieron Richardson]]) leaving party. Trevor tries to stop Clare from dedonating the bomb but fails and the council flats are blown up killing [[Ash Kane]], [[Leanne Holiday]] and Doug. Mercedes finds out and fights with Clare and throws her into an oncoming car which kills her. The driver turns out to be Paul who kidnaps Mercedes.

He takes her back to the McQueen house and keeps her hostage in there. When She mocks him he beats her up. He tries to kill her but gets hit with a shovel by Cindy, who is with Lindsey, and they believe he is dead until he wakes up and attacks Cindy as revenge, however Mercedes hits him with the shovel and hits him again killing him. They put him in the Price Slice freezer but when it breaks they hire [[Freddie Roscoe]] (Charlie Clapham) to get rid of the body. Freddie puts him in a car and throws it off a cliff and they all agree to keep quiet.

==Reception==
For his role as Doctor Browning, Joseph Thompson was nominated in the &quot;Newcomer&quot; category at the 2013 [[National Television Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=National Television Awards 2013: Longlist nominations in full - vote|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a407475/national-television-awards-2013-longlist-nominations-in-full-vote.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=22 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaci Stephen of the ''Daily Mail'' pondered whether &quot;Dr Browning ever do a full day’s work of, well, doctoring? While the rest of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] claims to be underpaid and overworked, Dr Browning is having a breeze. If ever he has the incentive to write a prescription, please put out the bunting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Jaci|title=SOAP WATCH: The ultimate insight into the week's soaps |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2186126/Soap-operas-Insight-EastEnders-Hollyoaks-Coronation-Street-more.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen's colleague, Claudia Connel felt that soap operas could help give [[David Cameron]] ideas to improve the NHS, noting that &quot;Dr Browning in Hollyoaks is even good enough to leave his office unlocked so patients can help themselves to whatever they fancy.

Laura Morgan of ''[[All About Soap]]'' felt that Doctor Browning is &quot;dodgy&quot; and that he is a &quot;fairly obvious suspect&quot; in the investigation for Lynsey's murder. She added that Doctor Browning &quot;might not be a murderer, but you can't deny there's something not right about the preying practitioner&quot;. Morgan explained that Doctor Browning has a hold over Mercedes due to him having proof that Mercedes was in the village when Lynsey was killed although she though that Doctor Browning &quot;could he be trying to cover his own tracks by shifting the blame onto someone else&quot;. Morgan went on to say that after Doctor Browning sees through Mercedes scheme to solve the problem, &quot;the devilish doc advised Mercedes she was better to keep him on side [...] we’re going to see a lot more of Dr Browning in the next few weeks. There’s going to be some interesting clues about his past, but will any of these lead us to be convinced he’s a cold-blooded killer?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Laura|title=Hollyoaks: Dr Browning Is Dodgy!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-dr-browning-is-dodgy/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=12 July 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's ''All About Soap'' colleague Carena Crowford felt that was &quot;something suspect&quot; about Doctor Browning. She said Silas was left alone with &quot;the dodgy doc, and the next thing they knew the old man had knocked Browning out, stolen his shoes and run away. Come on, are we really expected to believe Silas could take out young, strong Dr B alone? Or is this evidence they’re working together...?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowford|first=Carena|title=Hollyoaks: Silas Has Escaped!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-silas-has-escaped/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was revealed Doctor Browning killed Lynsey, Morgan said she &quot;had the dastardly doc's card marked from day one, but have to admit that tonight's big reveal has left us a bit cold&quot;. She said that the murder was &quot;a crime of passion, but there’s no way Mercy is worth killing for. [...] Disappointingly, it also transpired that Dr Browning has zilch to do with Silas's epic return. It was a mere coincidence that the medical man was caught up in the serial killer’s escape from hospital. We think it could have made a brilliant twist if Silas had been schooling Dr B, and getting him to carry on his work while he was behind bars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Laura|title=Hollyoaks: Dr Browning Did It!|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/hollyoaks-dr-browning-did-it/|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Inside Soap]]'' journalist Sarah commented Lynsey's killer is revealed to be &quot;none other than dodgy Dr Browning! Who saw that one coming?&quot; She went on to add that her colleague had guessed the &quot;menacing medic&quot; to be responsible for the &quot;despicable act&quot; but because Doctor Browning was not one of the original suspects listed she had overlooked him as a suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynsey’s Killer Revealed! |url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/inside-story/lynseys-killer-revealed.html |work=[[Inside Soap]] |publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]]) |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116094355/http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/inside-story/lynseys-killer-revealed.html |archivedate=16 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony D.

He went on to comment that it had previously &quot;mattered little&quot; to him that Doctor Browning could be responsible for the murder &quot;but over the past several weeks, much has changed. The more I got to see the good doctor and his blistering chemistry with Mercedes, the more I liked him. Yes, the doctor is a bit twisted and a bad boy, but he was perfect for a twisted girl like Mercedes. I loved their scenes — they were hot, hot, hot. I really thought they made a delicious and fun couple. But now it’s all ruined with Browning being a killer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D.

'''Matthew Buchanan''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]''. Born onscreen in 1999, the character was rapidly aged in 2001 with the casting of [[Eddie Alderson]], re-establishing his birth year as 1994 (which is also Alderson's birth year). Alderson stayed with the series until the [[ABC Daytime]] finale in 2012. Upon resuming as a web series via [[The Online Network]], Robert Gorrie was cast in the role and debuted April 29, 2013, ultimately revising his birth year to 1992.

Matthew is the only child between [[supercouple]] [[Bo Buchanan]] and [[Nora Hanen]], as well as the grandson of business tycoon [[Asa Buchanan]]. The character's most significant storylines include his friendship with [[Starr Manning]], played by Alderson's real-life sister, [[Kristen Alderson]], his romances with [[Destiny Evans]] and [[Danielle Manning]], his time as a paraplegic thanks to a car accident, as well as his feud with [[Nate Salinger]] ignited by Matthew's murder of his father, [[Eddie Ford (One Life to Live)|Eddie Ford]].

Matthew changes his name to Buchanan on June 17, 2005 as a [[Father's Day]] gift to Bo.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC.com&quot;/&gt; Matthew has shared a long friendship with [[Starr Manning]], who often manages to get him tangled up in her schemes.

===2008–12===
In 2008, high school freshman Matthew has trouble fitting in, but is helped by his mother's ward, upperclassman [[Cole Thornhart]] ([[Brandon Buddy]]). Matthew befriends a feisty and intelligent girl named [[Destiny Evans]] ([[Shenell Edmonds]]), who cannot understand his need to be liked by the popular crowd. Early in 2009, Matthew tries impress a girl named Becca Salzman (Dina Sipovich) by &quot;admitting&quot; to his parents that he proudly smokes marijuana (which he does not). Matthew narrowly escapes being sent off to military school, and thinks everything is coming together when Becca dances with him at a school dance. When Becca and her cohort Justin ([[Jack Rovello]]) humiliate Matthew publicly by attributing the dance to a dare, an upset Matthew runs out and urges Cole, whom he knows is high on drugs, to drive him away. They crash, and Matthew is paralyzed from the waist down indefinitely. He is devastated by the news, but does not blame Cole. Matthew meets with a young doctor named [[Greg Evans (One Life to Live)|Greg Evans]] ([[Terrell Tilford]]), Destiny's estranged older brother. Greg later promises that he can help Matthew walk again by performing a tricky surgery. Afraid of the risks, Bo and Nora refuse. A furious Matthew hires ruthless lawyer [[Téa Delgado]] ([[Florencia Lozano]]) to sue his parents for the right to make his own decision about the surgery. Bo and Nora bond on the eve of Nora's marriage to Bo's brother [[Clint Buchanan]] ([[Jerry verDorn]]), and Matthew and Destiny see them kiss. Immediately prior to the wedding, Matthew threatens to tell Clint if his parents do not yield and allow him to have the surgery. They refuse, but Matthew ultimately does not reveal the truth to Clint to spare his feelings. In court, Téa also attempts to coerce Bo and Nora using the secret of their kiss, despite Matthew's forbidding her to do so. When Téa viciously cross-examines Matthew's half-sister [[Rachel Gannon]] ([[Daphnée Duplaix Samuel]]) on the stand, Matthew fires her. Matthew wins the case and decides to proceed with the surgery. To prevent him from going through with it, Bo and Nora steal Matthew away to a London boarding school, where he meets [[Danielle Rayburn]] ([[Kelley Missal]]), Téa's daughter. With Destiny's help, the teens escape and flee back to the United States, where Matthew has the surgery. He regains his ability to walk, and Destiny confesses that she is in love with him, but Matthew soon shares a kiss with Dani; they eventually begin dating. However, when the two go out for the school musical they are introduced to a new transfer student named [[Nate Salinger]] ([[Lenny Platt]]). Dani falls for Nate and dumps Matthew at Bo and Nora's wedding. Heart broken, Matthew almost sleeps with a prostitute hired by his older brother [[David Vickers Buchanan|David]] ([[Tuc Watkins]]), but later reveals to Destiny that he paid the hooker, Fawn, not to sleep with him.  Angry at Nate, Matthew harasses him at the country club, where Matthew is a member but Nate an employee, and at basketball tryouts. When the thug Bull is looking for the $50,000 which [[James Ford (One Life to Live)|James Ford]] (Nic Robuck) had stolen from his father, and which was discovered by Nate, Matthew points Bull towards Nate, resulting in him being kidnapped, and ransomed by Dani and her father, [[Todd Manning]] ([[Trevor St. John]]). Matthew is further angered when his father Bo gives Nate's mother [[Inez Salinger|Inez]] ([[Jessica Leccia]]) a job as his assistant.

Matthew goes to work for his Clint at ''Buchanan Enterprises'' as he idolizes his uncle. While there, he catches [[Rex Balsom]] ([[John-Paul Lavoisier]]) breaking into Clint's office, and turns him over to security, allowing Clint to blackmail Rex into keeping quiet about Clint's abduction of David, and later to blackmail [[Echo DiSavoy]] ([[Kim Zimmer]]) into keeping quiet about Rex being Clint's son. When Clint hatches a plan to get Inez to seduce Bo, and has Eddie Ford ([[John Wesley Shipp]]) kidnap Nora, Clint hints to Matthew that both of his parents are having affairs. This leads Matthew to Inez's apartment, where he witnesses her kissing a drugged Bo. Rex rescues Nora from Eddie's room at the Minuteman Hotel. Leaving Inez's home in tears, Matthew drives away. While trying to call Clint, he nearly collides with a car containing Rex and Nora. Matthew drives off, but Rex's car crashes.

Eddie Ford's body is found at the Minuteman several hours later.  Rex is injured from the car accident and Nora is missing.

The next day at school, Matthew argues with Nate Salinger, calling Nate's mother (Inez) a homewrecker. Matthew and Destiny share their first kiss, both feeling that their families had betrayed them. Matthew is enraged at his father until Inez finally admits that she had drugged Bo to make him think that they had sex, but did not. Rex uncovers evidence that Clint had been at the Minuteman Hotel, and when Bo and Nora charge him, Clint reveals to Bo and Nora that he was covering up for Matthew, and has a tape recording where Matthew confesses, and he gives that tape to his parents.  Clint went to the Minuteman to cover up all the evidence, including planting the murder weapon at Inez' apartment.  Bo and Nora drop the charges against Clint, but keep quiet about Matthew, leading many to wonder why the charges were dropped. A reporter pressures Destiny for information about the Buchanans and the Eddie Ford murder, and Destiny accidentally implies that Matthew killed Eddie. Matthew later confesses to Destiny. She comforts Matthew and the end up making love for the first time.

Destiny avoids Matthew until he tracks her down and they are held hostage by a gun-wielding [[Marty Saybrooke]] ([[Susan Haskell]]) who has kidnapped Matthew's infant cousin, [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. Matthew steps in front of the gun to protect Destiny. Destiny's brother, [[Shaun Evans (One Life to Live)|Shaun Evans]] ([[Sean Ringgold]]) accidentally overhears the teens discussing their tryst, but Destiny manages to talk her way out of it. However, Matthew assures Destiny that their one-night stand meant something to him. Later Destiny confides in Dani that Matthew killed Eddie; Nate overhears this and he heads to Matthew's apartment to confront him. Nate punches Matthew as soon as he opens the door, he falls back and hits his head on the coffee table. To protect Matthew, Clint confesses to the crime himself, thinking that he won't serve any time due to his heart giving out on him leaving Matthew devastated. He then confesses to his parents and suddenly collapses. Matthew regains consciousness at the hospital and mistakenly believes it is the year 2009. Matthew undergoes emergency surgery  for  a subdural hematoma. However, following the surgery, Matthew falls into a brief coma. On June 15, 2011 when all hope is lost for Matthew awakens. Bo and Nora send him to a facility in nearby [[Philadelphia]] for rehab. In July 2011 Destiny takes a pregnancy test which confirms she is pregnant. She then confesses to an incoherent Matthew.&lt;ref name=&quot;August 10, 2011&quot;/&gt; In November 2011, Matthew briefly flatlines before he is revived, and finally wakes from a six-month-long coma and realizes Destiny is pregnant. Matthew is furious with Nora when he learns she coerced Destiny into keeping the baby and confides in Destiny that he doesn't know how he feels about being a teenage father. After a pep talk from David, Matthew steps up and agrees to be a father to his child. Destiny and Matthew welcome their son, [[Drew Buchanan II|Drew]] named after his later brother on January 13, 2012.

==Casting and creation==
The role was originated by child actors Steven and Nicholas Towler in February 1999 upon the character's onscreen birth. The Towler brothers vacated the role in June 2000. Ian Chandler Sheaffer from July 2000 to the spring of 2001. Eddie Alderson assumed the role on April 2001, on a recurring basis and first appeared on May 10, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC.com&quot;/&gt; According to costar Hillary B. Smith, Alderson's casting was a bit unconventional. She revealed during an interview that at the time, Sheaffer was having trouble with the role. Alderson at the time was just a kid who hung around the studio because of his sister being on set. Some of a crew members, including Smith recommended Alderson as the new Matthew and then executive producer, [[Gary Tomlin]] agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/oltls-hillary-b-smith-talks-chappell-gering-alderson-as-w-c-auction-continues/2010/03/28/|title=OLTL’s Hillary B.

'''Lady Bullseye''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillainess]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. A female counterpart of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], she was created by [[Ed Brubaker]], [[Marko Djurdjevic]], and [[Clay Mann]], first appearing in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #111. She has primarily been an opponent of the superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].

Originally inspired to become a trained assassin when she witnessed [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] easily kill a number of people, she would later become a member of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], although she did not hold their traditions in high esteem. Her alter ego is a lawyer, opposing Matt Murdock in the courtroom, thereby attacking Daredevil on two fronts. Lady Bullseye's true intentions were to take control of the Hand clan, but instead Daredevil becomes their leader.

==Publication history==
Lady Bullseye was inspired by [[Lady Snowblood (manga)|Lady Snowblood]], a Japanese [[femme fatale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enterladybullseye&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4804.Daredevil~colon~_Enter_Lady_Bullseye|title=Daredevil: Enter Lady Bullseye|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|date=2008-09-05 |publisher=Marvel.com|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Japan]], the young girl (it has not been revealed whether Maki Matsumoto is her birth name or an assumed one) who would become Lady Bullseye was imprisoned by the [[Yakuza]], who planned to sell her and many others into sexual slavery. However, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on an unrelated errand, arrived to slaughter the mobsters. The sight of Bullseye effortlessly killing her captors inspired the girl to escape and become a killer.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #111&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, now in the employ of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], the famous ninja order, she arrives in New York, to take the lead in Hand ninja-lord Hiroshi's plan. However, she has demonstrated little tolerance for the Hand's ritual, interrupting some (who are used to those traditions) off-guard in order to kill her enemies. She kills and resurrects both [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]] and [[Black Tarantula]] to assist her.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #112-114&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it has been revealed that in her civilian guise she is a lawyer, targeting [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] by assisting the parents of Murdock's mentally-ill wife [[Milla Donovan]] in gaining custody of her. When one of her associates discovers this, she kills him to prevent the Hand from learning the truth. Hiroshi claims that all she has done has been according to his will. Lady Bullseye offers Daredevil the leadership of the Hand, which he refuses. The organization regroups to [[Spain]], preparing to initiate &quot;Plan B&quot;. There, she finds [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], trying to live a normal civilian life, and killing his new girlfriend and her kids, and brutally stabbing Kingpin, telling him that this is a message for Matt Murdock.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #114-116&lt;/ref&gt;

It turns out that Matsumoto's real goal was to take the leadership of the Hand herself, something she had been promised by Daredevil's ally [[Master Izo]], who was revealed to have trained her. However, Izo was lying, and instead intended for Daredevil himself to take that post and reform the Hand. This occurring, Daredevil had Lady Bullseye cast out of the Hand for being untrustworthy. Angry, she vowed to kill Izo.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #500&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Bullseye is shown to now be allied with the Kingpin against Daredevil, instigating a conflict between Daredevil and [[Norman Osborn]], which ultimately leads to Daredevil declaring Hell's Kitchen the territory of the Hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign - The List: Daredevil'' #1, ''Daredevil'' #501-504&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Bullseye was hired by an as yet unknown party to temporarily injure [[Pepper Potts]] with a compressed air rifle.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Widow'' Vol. 4 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Bullseye has no apparent superhuman powers, but is a master of several martial arts and a proficient hand-to-hand combatant, and specializes in using both a katana and shuriken. It has been noted that she is faster than both Bullseye and the Kingpin. However, she is also less powerful. That did not stop her from defeating Daredevil and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] on separate occasions, and nearly defeating Daredevil on another occasion. Daredevil has commented that in her costumed form she has little scent and a very level pulse, akin to one performing [[yoga]]. She is also skilled in legal matters, being a lawyer in her civilian guise.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil #113''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Daredevil Noir===
Lady Bullseye appears as a caucasian woman called '''Eliza'''. She is an operative of the Kingpin, and a lover of a rival crime lord called O'Halloran.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil Noir'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Zombies===
A zombiefied version of Lady Bullseye is part of an invasion team that heads into the 'Marvel Ape' universe, desperate for fresh meat. The simian Torch slays Bullseye with a blast of heat.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution&quot; #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burglar''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was left unnamed in most of his appearances. He is best known as the first criminal faced by [[Spider-Man]], and as the killer of the hero's uncle and surrogate father figure, [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]]. The Burglar first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962), making him directly responsible for Ben Parker's death and Spider-Man's turn to [[superhero]]ics.

The Burglar's name was never revealed in the comics. He was completely unnamed in ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15, and it was only in 1996, 15 years after his second and final appearance in the comics,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man #200&quot;&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #200&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of his estranged daughter Jessica,&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #0&lt;/ref&gt; that the possibility arose that he might share her last name of '''Carradine'''. However, it remains unconfirmed whether this is the Burglar's surname, as his daughter may be using her mother's maiden name, or that of her adoptive parents. In addition, The burglar happens to have a nephew named Jimmy Costas, in which Jimmy wears hand-me-downs from his uncle, and even said that his &quot;Uncle&quot; may have run into Spider-Man once or twice, which shocked Spider-Man when  he found out.

The name '''Dennis Carradine''' has been used in a variety of media over the years. His last name also appeared on a list of known cat burglars in Marvel's ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' series, but not been formally connected to the Burglar character in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man #53 (2004)&quot;&gt;''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #53 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the first [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'' film]], the burglar character is referred to only as a '''Carjacker'''. In the film ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', he reappears in a flashback scene of Uncle Ben's death. In the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|''Spider-Man'' video game]] based on the first film, Dennis Carradine is the leader of a gang called the &quot;Skulls&quot; and calls himself &quot;'''Spike'''&quot;. He also appears in the reboot of the film franchise [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'']]. The origin story takes inspiration from the Ultimate comics where he robs a convenience store, and the clerk tells Peter to help stop him, but Peter refuses, which results in Uncle Ben's death. He reappears in the non-canonical [[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' video game]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
The Burglar first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962).

Following the Burglar's first one-off appearance, there have been multiple successors to the Burglar identity. In ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #49-50 (May 1990), Spider-Man battles a man who is explicitly described as having the same attire as the burglar who shot his Uncle Ben. At one point the man cryptically states, &quot;I owe [Spider-Man] for what he did to my brother.&quot; In ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' #26 (September 1992), Spider-Man encounters another man in the Burglar's attire, minus the pistol. It is heavily implied that this Burglar's maternal uncle was the original Burglar.

==Fictional character biography==
Little of the Burglar's early history is known, but it is mentioned that even in his younger years he was a criminal. Caught at some point in his life, the Burglar became the cellmate of elderly gangster Dutch Mallone. The Burglar learned from Dutch, who talked in his sleep, about a large possession of money the aged gangster had hidden in a suburban home, which the Burglar planned and schemed to get (ironically, the possession had since been devoured by [[silverfish]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man #200&quot;/&gt;

Wanting to find out the location of the home where Mallone's possession was, the Burglar successfully robs a television station for information. Peter Parker, who has become a minor celebrity as Spider-Man, did not bother to stop him despite having the opportunity to do so. Learning that the house where Mallone's money had been hidden was the Parker house, the Burglar breaks into it searching for the money, killing Ben Parker (Peter's uncle) when he tries to interfere. Fleeing the scene, the Burglar is chased by police to a warehouse where Spider-Man, wanting to avenge the death of his Uncle Ben, attacks and knocks out the Burglar.  It is then that Spider-Man realizes that the man is the thief he had encountered earlier at the television station. The Burglar was later left to be captured by the authorities by Spider-Man, who, realizing he could have prevented Ben's death by simple humanitarian behavior in the earlier encounter, decided to use his powers more responsibly, never again ignoring a crime if he could help it.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Fantasy'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, the Burglar, having served his time in prison, is released, despite being deemed mentally unstable by psychiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #170&lt;/ref&gt; Still searching for Mallone's treasure, the Burglar rents the old Parker home, and after tearing it apart and finding nothing, instead decides to interrogate Ben Parker's widow, [[Aunt May|May Parker]], who now resides in a nursing home. The Burglar partners with the nursing home's owner and head doctor Ludwig Rinehart, who is actually the supervillain [[Mysterio]].  The two take May captive and fake her death. The partnership later sours and the two criminals turn on each other, with Rinehart revealing his true nature before beating and imprisoning the Burglar. Escaping Mysterio, the Burglar retreats to the warehouse where he was first captured by Spider-Man—and where he has been holding May Parker captive. Spider-Man soon tracks and confronts the Burglar, to whom he reveals his true identity as Ben Parker's nephew. Believing that Spider-Man is about to kill him as revenge for murdering Ben, the Burglar suffers a fear-induced heart attack and dies.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man #200&quot;/&gt;

He had a daughter named Jessica Carradine, a photographer who has a brief relationship with Spider-Man's clone, [[Ben Reilly]]. She believes the murder her father committed was an accident—that the gun Ben Parker was shot with was his own, which went off by accident during a fight—and that Spider-Man had murdered him to stop him revealing the truth about his &quot;innocence.&quot; After learning that Ben Reilly is Spider-Man,&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; she first threatens to expose him with a photograph she took of him unmasked, but, having witnessed Ben risk his life to save innocent people in a burning skyscraper, decides against it, and gives him the photograph, later visiting Ben Parker's grave to apologize for her previous poor perception of him.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Burglar===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', a reimagining of the Spider-Man mythos, the origin story from ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 is reinterpreted over the course of seven issues. Ben Parker's death at the hands of the Burglar does not occur until ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. The name &quot;Carradine&quot; appears on a list of &quot;known cat burglars,&quot; but nothing else is said about it;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man #53 (2004)&quot;/&gt; it is unclear whether Carradine is actually the burglar who killed Uncle Ben in this universe or is simply another criminal. Spider-Man has a copy of the Burglar's driver license but the name is always hidden when viewed by the readers. This was done intentionally by the artists.

The man named Carradine is also believed in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #8 to be a part of the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], a group working work for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].

===What If...?===
Various alternate versions of the Burglar appear throughout the ''[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]'' comic line, most often in stories dealing with Spider-Man's origin being reimagined.

* One storyline saw [[Betty Brant#Other versions|Betty Brant]] - here Spider-Girl after she was bitten by the spider - failing to stop the burglar, retiring from her career and allowing Peter to synthetically duplicate her powers.&lt;ref&gt;''What If?'' Vol. 1 #7&lt;/ref&gt;
* One storyline features Spider-Man actually stopping the burglar simply for the publicity. In this case, Spidey destroyed the life of J.Jonah Jameson.
* In a storyline where Peter Parker is paralyzed by the spider-bite, he acquires the powers of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and returns home to visit Ben Parker just as the burglar arrives. The burglar's attempt to shoot Peter results in the bullet ricocheting off his chest and killing the burglar, prompting Peter to abandon his costume out of guilt at his role in the death, even if it is acknowledged as an accident.
* One storyline features Peter throwing the burglar out of a window and killing him after the burglar kills May instead, Ben taking the blame for the crime to spare his nephew.
* During ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', a six-armed Spider-Man and Spider-Man Noir visit a world where Peter had an allergic reaction to the spider-bite and was left in a coma, with the burglar never killing anyone as he broke into the Parker house while Ben and May were visiting Peter in hospital.

===Chapter One===
In this version, the burglar saw Peter leaving his house wearing his costume for the first time and thought that Spider-Man was a fellow burglar after the Parker treasure as well. Confronting him, he offers a partnership with the web-spinner but is instead punched and thrown in jail.

==In other media==

===Television===
The Burglar has appeared in almost every animated Spider-Man media adaption there is, in which most of the time he is in flashbacks.

* The Burglar appeared in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, in the episode &quot;The Origin of Spider-Man&quot;. The animation means that his appearance seems to change.
* The Burglar appeared in a flashback in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode &quot;Arsenic and Aunt May&quot;. It is also shown that his cousin was recently apprehended by Spider-Man and ended up a cellmate of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]].
* The Burglar reappeared in the sequel to the 1981 ''Spider-Man'' series, ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''. In the episode &quot;Along Came Spidey&quot;, he appears in a flashback scene of Spider-Man's origin story.
* The Burglar appeared in flashback in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' episode &quot;[[The Menace of Mysterio]]&quot; and is recurring among any other episodes soon after. There, he is shown robbing the wrestling arena that Spider-Man was in before he began to fight crime.
* The Burglar appears in the opening sequence of ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' where the intro shows Spider-Man letting him escape and then shows Spider-Man catching the criminal.
* The Burglar appeared in a flashback in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' episode &quot;Intervention&quot; with his grunts done by [[Jim Cummings]] in the first appearance and voiced by [[James Remar]] in the second appearance. This version is an amalgam of [[Walter Hardy]] from the original comics and the burglar that shot Uncle Ben from the comics. In a flashback accessed by the symbiote, he is shown robbing Sullivan Edwards. Instead of stopping him, Spider-Man lets him escape in the elevator, as revenge on Sullivan Edwards for not paying him. Using his spider powers to help him get home, he then opened the door to a crying Aunt May. Peter ran over to comfort her and ask her what happened. She then tells him that Uncle Ben was murdered by a burglar who broke into their house in search of money and stole Ben's car. Peter is furious at this and seeks revenge, so he goes after the criminal as Spider-Man and confronts him in an old warehouse. Spider-Man unmasks the robber, only to find it was the same man whom he let escape earlier. He knocks the criminal out, lowers him via a web line, and leaves him for the police. In &quot;Opening Night&quot;, his identity as the father of the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] is revealed to Spider-Man. Black Cat comes to break him out of the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] as Spider-Man volunteers to test a maximum security cell. During the climax of the episode he explains to Felicia (and Spider-Man) his pride in never hurting anyone during his robberies, never even carrying a gun until he got older and slower and had less confidence in his own skills. Hardy recognizes his error in taking Ben Parker's life and believes he must pay for it. Staying behind as the others escape, Hardy activates the prison's knockout gas to subdue the escaped inmates (and himself) in the Vault.
* The Burglar appears in flashbacks in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episodes &quot;Great Power&quot; and &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot;. In this version, Spider-Man corners him on a street after Uncle Ben's death. However, he does not finish him and, like all previous versions, he webs him up and leaves him for the police.

===Film===
* In the film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', the Burglar is a minor antagonist who is portrayed by [[Michael Papajohn]] (credited as &quot;Carjacker&quot;). Peter is cheated out of his money at the wrestling ring by a fight promoter. When Peter objects, he is told &quot;I missed the part where that's my problem&quot;. Just as he leaves, the burglar enters and steals the promoter's money. Wanting to get even, Peter lets him go despite having the chance to stop him, repeating the promoter's words from a few minutes earlier. The burglar is suspected to have later killed Uncle Ben while attempting to steal his car. Overhearing a police radio saying he's heading to a warehouse, Peter chases the burglar and confronts him. As the burglar backs away, he trips and falls from a window to his death.
* In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', the Burglar was mentioned when May expresses that she feels she had caused Ben's death. However, this prompts Peter into telling her that he let the criminal escape causing Ben's death, despite being capable of stopping him. Although Aunt May is shocked by this, she commends Peter on telling the truth.
* In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', it is revealed in a [[retcon]] that the &quot;Carjacker&quot; (now identified as &quot;Dennis Carradine&quot;) is not responsible for Ben Parker's death as assumed. The true killer is Carradine's partner, Flint Marko (who later becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]); there were two witnesses who saw the whole scene. Peter begins to feel sympathy for Carradine, imagining a scene with Carradine attempting in vain to stop Marko from killing Ben. After the climax of the film, however, Marko confesses to Peter that he accidentally shot Ben when Carradine distracted him while trying to get into the car. Carradine (who was shocked at the killing) stole the car and left Marko behind to take the fall. Marko escaped, however, and so it was Carradine who died for the crime Marko committed. Marko also confesses to Peter that he only wanted the car in his desperation for the money he and Carradine stole to save his sickly daughter. Understanding the importance of forgiveness over revenge, Peter forgives Marko and allows him to leave.
* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', the Burglar (portrayed by Leif Gantvoort and credited as &quot;Cash Register Thief&quot;) distracts a deli clerk after he refuses to let Peter buy himself a bottle of chocolate milk, and steals money from the till. The burglar throws the milk to Peter on his way out and Peter lets him escape despite having the chance to stop him. While running down the street, the thief trips in front of Ben (searching for his nephew) and a pistol falls out of his jacket. Ben attempts to grab it away, but a brief struggle results in Ben getting killed and the thief escaping. Peter rushes over to Ben's body and screams. After he obtains a police sketch and is told the thief had a [[tattoo]] of a star on his left wrist, Peter realizes that it was the [[thief]] he let go. Over the next few weeks, Peter designs and builds web-shooters and the Spider-Man suit. He then listens to crime reports and follows any that alludes to the Burglar, locating and apprehending many criminals who fit the description. However, none of them have a star tattoo on their wrist. By the end of the film, the wanted poster of him is seen on Peter's notice board; the thief remains at large and has yet to be found.

===Video games===
* The Burglar (Dennis Carradine) calls himself &quot;Spike&quot; and is the first boss in the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game (based on the 2002 [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|film]]), wielding a sawed-off shotgun. He was also stated in a cutscene to be the leader of the &quot;Skulls Gang.&quot; After Peter beats him, Spike trips and falls from a window to his death similar to the film.
* The Burglar (Cash Register Thief) appears in the first chapter of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]]. He was credited by [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]] as a low level guy named Dennis Carradine (possibly inspired from ''Spider-Man 3'') who has been selling advanced weaponry to gangs. After Spider-Man saves the civilian hostage during his chase on Carradine, Dennis is killed by [[Carnage (comics)|Cletus Kasady]] shortly before Spider-Man finds his dead body in an alley.

She is a medical fertility specialist who is recruited to the Island by [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] to solve the fertility problems occurring. Being unable to leave, she suffers from several breakdowns, wishing to see her sister again.

Issue #16.&lt;/ref&gt; Juliet is a compassionate and intelligent individual who dedicates her time to helping others, but often feels conflicted over her own needs.

The character has received significant praise and is often referred to as the series' best female character. Mitchell's performance has been lauded by television commentators and she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]] in 2010.

== Character's background ==

=== Prior to arrival on the island ===

As a child, Juliet Carlson was devastated and angry to learn that her parents (Michael Trisler and Amy Stewart) were divorcing. Her mother claimed that although she and Juliet's father loved each other, they were not meant to be together. This statement seemed to affect Juliet's later outlook on relationships.

Before coming to the island, she was a doctor and medical researcher, living in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] near her sister Rachel ([[Robin Weigert]]). Now going by her married name of Juliet Burke, she was working for her ex-husband, Edmund Burke, ([[Željko Ivanek]]) as a [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|fertility scientist]] at Miami Central University. Edmund bullied an acquiescent Juliet and flaunted his sexual conquests, but despite her docile nature, Juliet was performing unauthorized experiments on her sister. Rachel's [[reproductive system]] had been ravaged by [[chemotherapy]], rendering her sterile. Juliet was attempting to restore her [[fertility]].

In 2001, Juliet was approached by [[Mittelos Bioscience]] and offered a job where she would &quot;lead a team of highly trained people,&quot; according to [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]). Claiming her ex-husband would never allow her to leave, Juliet jokingly said she would not be able to accept the job offer unless he were hit by a bus, before breaking down into tears and rushing out.

When Juliet got home from the interview, her sister revealed to her that she was pregnant. Later that day, Juliet told Edmund the news. During their discussion, Edmund stepped off the sidewalk and into the street, only to be hit by a bus and die of his injuries.

Richard showed up at the morgue with [[Ethan Rom]] ([[William Mapother]]). They expressed their condolences and again asked her to join their company. Juliet accepted, believing that her job would only last six months. Soon after this, Rachel's cancer went into [[remission (medicine)|remission]].

Upon arriving at a private airfield to depart for her new position with Mittelos, Juliet was unsettled at the amount of secrecy involved — especially considering she didn't even know where the company was located. Richard then offered her [[orange juice]] he admitted was filled with [[tranquilizer]]. Sensing reservation on Juliet's part, Richard revealed that her expertise as a fertility specialist — especially her miraculous treatment of her sister — was the reason for her recruitment, promising she would see things on the island that she would never have believed possible. Persuaded, Juliet drank the juice and quickly fell [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].

=== On the island, prior to the crash ===
Juliet awakens aboard the Others' submarine, strapped down for safety. She is freed by Ethan and then disembarks to the island where she meets [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]). A week after she arrives on the island, in mid-September 2001, she begins therapy with the Others' resident psychologist, Dr. Harper Stanhope  ([[Andrea Roth]]). Their first discussion is cut short by Ben presenting her with a newly furnished house in the Barracks. Juliet is very appreciative, but protests as she is only going to be on the island for six months. Ben brushes off this fact. Later, in the Staff, she meets [[Others (Lost)#Goodwin|Goodwin Stanhope]] ([[Brett Cullen]]), who is attempting to find ointment for a chemical burn on his arm. It later becomes apparent Goodwin is Harper's estranged husband.

For the next three years, she treats pregnant mothers per Ben's orders, but with uniformly fatal results. At some point she also begins an affair with Goodwin. Harper later finds out about their relationship and confronts Juliet in one of their sessions. However, instead of being angry at Juliet, she offers her a warning that if their relationship is not ended, then there will be consequences, not from her, but from Ben. It is then alluded that Ben might have a crush on Juliet.

Later she is discouraged by the lack of results in her work, but is forced to remain on the island &quot;until her work is done.&quot; Juliet seeks to return to her sister Rachel, but Ben reveals her cancer had returned — she would be dead before Juliet arrives. However, he promises if Juliet stays, he will cure Rachel's cancer. She accepts this, but becomes suspicious of Ben when she discovers his spinal tumor on an [[x-ray]]. She then confronts him, upset over his deception about no one on the island getting cancer. She tearfully asks to go home to her dying sister — who she believed was never going to be cured — but Ben refuses to let her go, creating hostility.

The next day, a distraught Juliet prepares to host a book club when she is visited by Amelia ([[Julie Adams]]). In deleted extras only on DVD, just as she is about to show Amelia the contents of a hidden envelope, the rest of the book club arrive. While discussing ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', Juliet and the rest of the Others witness [[Oceanic Flight 815]] breaking up in the air and crashing on the island.

=== Following the crash ===
Immediately after the crash, Ben sends Ethan and Goodwin to investigate the crash and infiltrate any survivors. After exchanging a meaningful look with Harper, it becomes apparent to Juliet that Ben sent Goodwin in order to get him out of the way. Ben then takes Juliet with him to see [[Others (Lost)#Mikhail Bakunin|Mikhail Bakunin]] ([[Andrew Divoff]]) at the Flame, who opens a live satellite connection to North America, where her seemingly healthy sister is shown playing with her now two-year-old son, Julien. Juliet breaks down crying and begs Ben to let her return home, but again Ben refuses.

Several weeks later, Ben invites Juliet to his house, under the pretense of having a dinner party, however, it turns out to be a date. Juliet asks Ben about Goodwin, and Ben attempts to sow discord between the two by implying Goodwin is interested in a relationship with [[Ana-Lucia Cortez]] ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]).  Ben also gives Juliet his thanks for how she has consoled tail section survivors Zach (Mickey Graue) and Emma (Kiersten Havelock). Several days later, Ben leads Juliet into the woods and they eventually come upon Goodwin's impaled corpse. Juliet is deeply distressed, and accuses Ben of wanting Goodwin to die. Ben does not deny this, and Juliet asks why. Ben becomes upset, telling her that she should know. He goes on to state it is because &quot;You're mine.&quot; His attitude then abruptly changes, and he informs Juliet that she should take as much time as she needs with the corpse, and leaves her alone, even more distressed and upset.

Later, Juliet and Ben enter the [[DHARMA Initiative stations#Station 5: The Pearl|Pearl station]], where they watch [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) from one of the monitors. Juliet mentions she thinks Jack is cute. She soon questions Ben's motives for the planned kidnapping of Jack, to which he reveals his methods of persuasion. They leave shortly after, leaving behind a walkie-talkie, picked up by [[Nikki and Paulo|Paulo]] ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]).

When [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]] ([[Harold Perrineau]]) is in captivity, Juliet visits him and informs him the Others have granted him a boat to leave the island. She also comments on how [[Walt Lloyd]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]) is &quot;special.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spoilerslost.blogspot.com/2007/11/lost-mobisode-2-missing-pieces-deal.html DarkUFO Blogspot - Lost Mobisode, Episode 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Juliet tells Ben how dangerous Walt is becoming when he does something in &quot;Room 23&quot;. Ben tells Juliet he's only a child, but Juliet then takes Ben to a pile of dead birds and tells him no child would do that.

==== Season 3 ====
Juliet is assigned to interrogate a captured [[Jack Shephard|Jack]] in the underwater section of the [[DHARMA Initiative stations#Station ?: The Hydra|Hydra]] station. At first, Jack refuses to cooperate, almost flooding the room, but Juliet manages to break through to him. She mostly brings him his food, but when she is called in to operate on [[Characters of Lost#Minor Others|Colleen]] ([[Paula Malcomson]]), she soon seeks Jack's help. Colleen dies, and Juliet attends the funeral, where Ben asks her why she showed Jack his x-rays. When she is told to convince Jack to operate on Ben, she plays Jack a video of her holding up cue-cards, telling Jack to &quot;accidentally&quot; kill Ben during surgery. When a desperate Jack holds Ben hostage during surgery and angrily reveals Juliet's plan, she claims Jack is bluffing. Ben wakes up during surgery and bargains with her to help [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[James &quot;Sawyer&quot; Ford|Sawyer]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) escape in exchange for her freedom off the island. She finds them held at gunpoint by [[Characters of Lost#Danny Pickett|Pickett]] ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]), and kills him on the spot. She is then tried for her crime, but via a deal made by Jack, is spared execution by Ben. Instead, she is marked on her lower back and treated by Jack before returning to the barracks.

Since returning, and after the capture of Kate and [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), Ben instructs her to infiltrate the survivors' camp in order to gain information on Kate, as well as other potentially pregnant women. She is then handcuffed to Kate and placed in the jungle, where she pretends to have been gassed and abandoned with her. However, after being chased by the &quot;Monster&quot;, Juliet unlocks the handcuffs, and shuts out the &quot;Monster&quot; using the sonar panel fence. The two return to camp, where Juliet frees Sayid. She migrates with the survivors soon after, under the protection of Jack. However, en route to retrieving medication for [[Claire Littleton]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), she narrowly avoids an interrogation from Sayid and Sawyer, and manages to help Claire. Juliet also takes [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun Kwon]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]) to the [[DHARMA Initiative stations#Station ?:The Staff|Staff]] station upon learning of her pregnancy, and uses the equipment to perform a scan on her fetus; she confirms she conceived on the island, and informs her that she has until her second trimester, in roughly two months. Soon after, Juliet confesses to Jack about her purpose for being in the camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spoilerslost.blogspot.com/2007/12/lost-mobisode-5-missing-pieces.html DarkUFO Blogspot - Lost Mobisode, Episode 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Kate informs Jack and Juliet of [[Characters of Lost#Naomi Dorrit|Naomi Dorrit]]'s ([[Marsha Thomason]]) arrival, prompting them to leave abruptly. They find [[Danielle Rousseau|Rousseau]] in the jungle and form a plan. When they return, they discover Sawyer has played Juliet's dictophone to the camp, revealing the notes she made on Sun's pregnancy. She then reveals the Others intend on invading the camp and abducting the pregnant women. Juliet and Jack lead the camp into the jungle to demonstrate their plan to defeat the Others. However, when [[Characters of Lost#Karl|Karl]] ([[Blake Bashoff]]) arrives to warn them of their immediate arrival, Juliet discloses information on the [[DHARMA Initiative stations#Station ?: The Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] station, used for blocking outgoing signals, before heading off to the radio tower with the majority of the camp. After witnessing Sayid's plan backfire, Juliet gives Jack a kiss before parting and joins Sawyer in his rescue effort on the beach. After [[Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes|Hurley]] ([[Jorge Garcia]]) runs over one of the surviving Others with the van, Juliet corners [[Tom Friendly|Tom]] ([[M. C. Gainey|M.C. Gainey]]) while Sawyer unexpectedly shoots him in cold blood.

==== Season 4 ====
In the season premiere, Juliet along with Sayid, Sawyer, Bernard and [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), question [[Desmond Hume]] ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]) about the warning [[Charlie Pace]] ([[Dominic Monaghan]]) had given before he died. However Hurley interrupts and questions Desmond of Charlie's whereabouts, Desmond tells them all Charlie had died, leaving the castaways devastated. Juliet is later present when Jack confronts [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) for the killing of Naomi and when the survivors split into two groups. Some survivors such as Sawyer, Hurley and Claire go with Locke to the barracks because they believe the people arriving at the Island will not rescue them. However, the majority including Juliet remain with Jack in hopes of getting rescued. Juliet, along with Sayid, disarm [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies]]) and [[Miles Straume]] ([[Ken Leung]]) who had Jack and Kate at gunpoint. Later, [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) figures out Juliet was not on the plane and asks her where Ben is.

When Faraday and [[Charlotte Lewis (Lost)|Charlotte Lewis]] ([[Rebecca Mader]]) disappear without note from the camp, Juliet and Jack run into the jungle in search for the newcomers. Juliet is confronted by Harper — her former therapist — and ordered to kill Faraday and Charlotte, accused by Ben of heading to The Tempest chemical station, to kill everyone on the island. Juliet and Jack find Kate on their road to The Tempest, but as Jack treats Kate who was tied up and knocked unconscious by Charlotte, Juliet vanishes and pursues the two freighter people on her own. She finds them executing their mission in the station, and takes Faraday at gun point, just until Charlotte attacks her. When it turns out they are securing the station to prevent Ben from killing everyone on the island, she leaves them alone. Upon reuniting outside — and discussing the threat posed by a possessive Ben — Juliet and Jack share a kiss.

Once it is revealed Jack was suffering from appendicitis, Juliet operates on him.  Following the operation, Juliet reveals to Kate they kissed and it was only for Jack to prove to himself that he didn't have feelings for someone else.  Once Kate leaves, Juliet tells Jack  she knows he is awake and he has overheard the conversation.

Later, when Daniel is evacuating people to the Kahana by Zodiac, Juliet chooses to stay behind until everyone is safe. Later, Sawyer emerges from the ocean and encounters her on the beach, drinking a bottle of rum. He asks her what she is celebrating, and she replies  she is not celebrating, and motions to a billow of smoke over the ocean. Sawyer then asks &quot;Is that our boat?&quot;, and Juliet replies &quot;It was.&quot; Moments later, she disappears along with the rest of the island and its inhabitants when it's moved to its new location.

==== Season 5 ====

Juliet remains with the Flight 815 survivors after the Island is moved, eventually staying with Sawyer and a few others after being separated from them during an attack by The Others.  Juliet and Sawyer bond, which leads to Juliet deciding to stay with the other survivors once they join with the Dharma Initiative in the '70s.  Over the next three years, she and Sawyer fall in love and develop a relationship, and are living together by the time Jack, Kate, and Hurley return.

Once their cover is blown, Juliet and Sawyer attempt to flee Dharma.  They are captured, and set to be shipped back to the mainland, but escape when they learn of Jack's plan to destroy the Swan Station before it can be completed.

Through flashbacks, it is revealed Juliet's parents divorced when she was a child, telling her and her sister they still loved each other but were not meant to be together.  Juliet later repeats this reason to Sawyer, believing he still has feelings for Kate.  She decides instead to help Jack, hoping if his plan works, she will never meet Sawyer and thus never lose him.

When the magnetic forces beneath the Swan become unstable in &quot;[[The Incident (Lost)|The Incident]]&quot;, Juliet is struck by a loose chain and pulled into the hole which has been drilled.  Sawyer and Kate attempt to save her, but Juliet lets go to avoid having Sawyer and Kate die with her.  Before she does, she admits she loves Sawyer more than anything. Juliet survives the fall, and - in the very last scene of season 5 - uses the last of her strength to strike the nuclear device Jack threw in earlier until it explodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=recap#t=162212&amp;d=201649 |title=Lost - Episode Recaps - &quot;The Incident, pt. 2&quot; |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Season 6 ====
Right at the moment of the blast of the &quot;Jughead&quot; bomb, Juliet and the survivors are thrown forward in time to 2007. Juliet arrives buried under the rubble of the Hatch. Kate hears her cries for help and Sawyer and the others frantically begin to dig her out. Sawyer manages to reach her and Juliet says they should get a coffee sometime and reveals she has something important to tell him. However, before she can convey her message, she dies from her injuries. Sawyer emerges from the rubble carrying Juliet's body and later he and Miles bury her. Sawyer forces Miles to 'read' her; he says the message is &quot;it worked&quot; but they do not understand what worked. In &quot;The Substitute,&quot; Juliet's surname - Burke - was seen on Jacob's wall, crossed out with the number 58 next to it.

===Afterlife===
Juliet appears as a doctor at the hospital where Jack works. She performed an ultrasound on Sun to confirm her child was all right as Sun recovered from a gunshot wound. Upon entering the room, Juliet says they don't speak English so she'll speak as little as possible. Juliet asked if they wanted to know the sex of the child. Sun and Jin remembered their lives and with it, remembered how to speak English and tell Juliet they know it's a girl. Juliet tells them, for the record, their English is fine.

Meeting Jack at St Sebastian, she takes David (her and Jack's son in the alternate time line) with her to the concert. While waiting to gain entry, she receives a message, and she must return to the Hospital. Upon arrival, she meets Sawyer, at the hospital vending machines. Juliet explains to James how to get the candy he'd just purchased out of the machine which didn't dispense correctly, by switching it off and back on. After James does this and the candy falls out of the machine, Juliet tells Sawyer &quot;it worked&quot; (her dying words in the original timeline). As Juliet passes the candy retrieved from the machine they brush fingers, and have flashes of their lives together, where they were in love. Remembering each other, they embrace and kiss passionately.

Juliet and Sawyer make their way to the church, where they reunite with other former denizens of the Island. After Christian Shephard opens the doors of the church, she moves on to the next reality while holding hands with Sawyer, her island lover.

'''Lincoln Burrows''', played by [[Dominic Purcell]], is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the two [[protagonist]]s of the [[United States|American]] [[television series]] ''[[Prison Break]]''. The plot of ''Prison Break'' revolves around Lincoln Burrows' setup for the murder of the vice president's brother and his brother's plan to help him escape his death sentence. Lincoln's brother, [[Michael Scofield]] is portrayed by [[Wentworth Miller]]. In episode flashbacks, the teenage Lincoln is played by Max Kirsch, while a younger Michael is portrayed by Dylan Minnette. Lincoln Burrows was born on March 17, 1970.

As one of the principal characters, Lincoln plays a prominent role in the series and appeared in every episode. The brothers' relationship is frequently explored in the series as their sacrifices for each other form a large part of the plot. In an interview, series creator [[Paul Scheuring]] commented that it was &quot;extremely difficult&quot; to cast the roles of Lincoln and Michael.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSMH-2006jan27&quot;/&gt; Dominic Purcell was cast for the role just three days before the start of production of the series pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuide-2006aug08&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
After their mother's falsified death, Lincoln became Michael's guardian. Lincoln dropped out of Morgan Park High School in [[Toledo, Ohio]] during his sophomore year and moved to Chicago to begin his life of crime. Prior to being convicted for the murder of the Vice President's brother, he had been convicted of theft, criminal damage to property, possession of drug paraphernalia, and battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/bios/bio_burrows.htm Lincoln Burrows' biography]{{dead link|date=April 2017}} ''[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Lisa Rix had a son together, [[L. J. Burrows|Lincoln Burrows, Jr. (L.J.)]] (played by [[Marshall Allman]]).

When Michael was 18, Lincoln borrowed $90,000 to pay for Michael's university education, telling him that it was his half of his mother's life insurance. There really was no life insurance and this money was the start of the events which ultimately led to Lincoln being sentenced to death. This was revealed in the flashback episode, &quot;[[Brother's Keeper (Prison Break episode)|Brother's Keeper]].&quot; Lincoln's actions instigates Michael's feeling of guilt and responsibility, which explains his reason for creating an elaborate plan to rescue his brother.

Lincoln is accused of murdering the vice president's brother, [[Terrence Steadman]]. Although he pleaded not guilty at the trial, he was convicted on all counts and sentenced to death due to an overwhelming amount of evidence. After exhausting all of his appeals, his execution date was set for May 11, 2006. At the start of the show, he has only one month left.

== Appearances ==

=== Season 1 ===
The character of Lincoln Burrows is first seen on newspaper articles in Michael Scofield's apartment. He makes his first real appearance later in the pilot episode when he is seen in the prison yard. It is established that Michael is his brother and a flashback sequence demonstrates the close bond of trust between them, as well as Michael's intention of breaking Lincoln out. After a surprise meeting with his brother inside the prison's chapel in the series pilot, Lincoln realizes that Michael is now an inmate. In the first two episodes, Lincoln's character and background is established, like his complicated and strained relationships with his teenage son L.J. and his ex-girlfriend Veronica Donovan. Particularly in the first few episodes, Lincoln warns Michael of the dangers in the prison and that he should be aware of his fellow inmates. As Michael begins to reveal his escape plan, Lincoln often takes a skeptical stance in the early episodes, trying to convince his brother of the futility in attempting escape and attempts to persuade Michael to abandon his plan, something he refuses to do. As the season progresses, Lincoln grows carefully hopeful of Michael's plan to help him escape. In episode &quot;English, Fitz or Percy&quot;, Lincoln admits that he had resigned himself to his fate, but that Michael has given him his hope back. The next episode &quot;Riots, Drills and the Devil&quot; further explores the tight bond between the protagonists.

As the season progresses, Lincoln's relationships with his son, L. J., and [[Veronica Donovan]] (played by [[Robin Tunney]]) grow stronger. L.J. slowly reconnects with his estranged father over several visits, while Veronica becomes convinced of his innocence and attempts to find evidence to exonerate him. Aside from scenes in visitation, Lincoln mostly appears in scenes with Michael in the chapel, with the rest of the escape team on PI or in his cell on death row, which coincidentally in real life, is the same cell that [[John Wayne Gacy]] was incarcerated in during his time at [[Joliet Prison]].&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;Ryan, M, &quot;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-050824prisonbreak,0,1650127.story Joliet prison is a 'Break'-out star]&quot;,{{dead link|date=April 2017}} ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]''. August 24, 2005. Retrieved on April 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From the eighth episode onwards, Lincoln and the rest of the escapees begin to dig a hole in the guard's break room. When L.J. is framed for murder by the conspiracy, Lincoln becomes worried and starts behaving irrationally, making him a liability to the escape plan. A secret message from L.J. in the episode &quot;Tweener&quot; manages to reassure him somewhat, however. In &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, Lincoln is forced to distract a guard to keep him from discovering the escape tunnel. Out of options, Lincoln punches the guard in the face and is sent to solitary. Despite this, Michael gets him transferred to the infirmary on the night on the escape for food poisoning. Lincoln is one of six inmates that are part of the failed escape attempt in &quot;End of the Tunnel.&quot; When it fails, he resigns to his fate.

The character plays a central role in &quot;The Rat&quot;, in which Lincoln prepares himself for the upcoming execution. The viewers are shown that he goes through different emotions, ranging from anger to sadness to plain numbness, as he is finally strapped to the electric chair at the end of the episode. His execution is delayed at the last minute with the help of a mysterious man that Lincoln identifies as his father [[Aldo Burrows]] (played by [[Anthony Denison]]), despite not having seen him for thirty years. But when Lincoln tries to explain in &quot;By the Skin and the Teeth&quot; that he saw his father in the viewing room on the night of the execution, he is met with skepticism. In the following episodes, Lincoln spends most of his scenes locked up in solitary and plays only a minor role in the plot. In &quot;The Key&quot; Lincoln's prison transport is ambushed en route to seeing his son L.J. and he is almost murdered by Secret Service agent [[Paul Kellerman]] (played by [[Paul Adelstein]]), a member of the conspiracy. Lincoln is rescued by his father, who explains to him that the murder setup of Terrence Steadman may have been caused by his desolation of &quot;[[The Company (Prison Break)|The Company]]&quot; after taking information with him about Steadman's company, Ecofield. Lincoln is re-captured soon afterwards. He is considered an attempted fugitive and returned to solitary, as nobody believes that there was an assassination attempt against him. He escapes successfully in &quot;Go&quot;, and the first season finale finally sees Lincoln outside the prison walls with his brother.

=== Season 2 ===
The character is featured more prominently in the second season than the first. He is featured mainly in scenes with his brother or the other escapees, and gets to take on a more active role than in the first season. Along with his brother and the other escapees in the [[Manhunt (Prison Break episode)|season premiere]], Lincoln successfully evades [[Brad Bellick]] (played by [[Wade Williams]]) and his guards. At the end of the episode he is heavily traumatized after talking with Veronica Donovan over the phone and hearing her getting executed by conspiracy agents. Outside the prison, Lincoln's first priority is to find his son, and the second episode “Otis” is dedicated to Michael and Lincoln’s failed attempt to rescue L.J. from the court house. After the failed impromptu prison-break, Lincoln has no choice but to accompany his brother on a journey to [[Utah]] to retrieve [[List of Prison Break minor characters#Charles Westmoreland|Charles Westmoreland]]'s five million dollars. Lincoln's anxiety for L.J. causes conflicts with Michael, who wants to follow his plan. The next three episodes sees Michael and Lincoln reuniting with several members of the escape team. Together they find the site of the former silo and begins to dig for the money. In &quot;Buried&quot;, Lincoln’s motivation to save his son is triggered again as he overhears on the news that L.J. is being released. Against Michael objections, Lincoln leaves the house at the end of the episode to find L.J., and the two characters have separate plotlines for the next few episodes.

In the next episode &quot;Dead Fall&quot;, Lincoln discovers that reuniting with L.J. might prove difficult, as he learns that he is monitored by agents of &quot;The Company.&quot; Lincoln manages to provide a distraction and escape with his son. In “Unearthed”, Lincoln appears in scenes with L.J., providing character development and building up the relationship between them. At the end of the episode, they are identified and arrested by the police. It is Lincoln's father Aldo that comes to his son's rescue, sending men to secure Lincoln and L.J. This begins Lincoln’s more direct involvement of the conspiracy plotline of the show, as his father outlines his plan to bring down The Company once and for all. In &quot;Disconnect&quot;, the two characters meet with Michael. Aldo is later killed by F.B.I. agent [[Alexander Mahone]] (played by [[William Fichtner]]), which prompts Michael and Lincoln to stop running and to find evidence to expose &quot;The Company&quot; by searching for [[Sara Tancredi]] (played by [[Sarah Wayne Callies]]). In &quot;[[The Killing Box]]&quot;, Michael and Lincoln are taken into custody by the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]]. On route back to Fox River, operatives of The Company helps them escape from the prison transport van in hopes of eliminating the brothers once and for all. The protagonists escape this death trap at the last minute, when they are aided by Paul Kellerman, who in an act of self-preservation, turns against &quot;The Company.&quot; At the end of the fall final, the brothers have no choice but to go along with their new uneasy ally.

In &quot;[[John Doe (Prison Break episode)|John Doe]]&quot; Lincoln comes face to face with Terrence Steadman, the man he was convicted of murdering. Steadman commits suicide and forces Lincoln and Michael to look for an alternative way to prove Lincoln's innocence. Lincoln, Michael and Kellerman find Sara and together, they head back to Chicago, where Sara's father, [[Frank Tancredi]] (played by [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]), had hidden the [[USB]] drive which holds a recorded conversation between [[Caroline Reynolds]] and Terrence Steadman after his supposed death date. When the tape proves to be useless as evidence, Lincoln and Michael attempt to blackmail President Caroline Reynolds (played by [[Patricia Wettig]]). When this also fails, Lincoln and Michael are forced to leave the country. In [[Sona (Prison Break episode)|Sona]] Lincoln's exoneration finally comes through when Paul Kellerman decides to testify against &quot;The Company.&quot; This makes Lincoln one of the two Fox River Eight members who have successfully evaded capture by the authorities. The brothers' joy is short-lived when Company executive [[William Kim|Bill Kim]] (played by [[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]]) tracks them down in Panama and has orders to kill &quot;one of them.&quot; Sara shoots Kim, allowing them to escape. As the police draw near, Lincoln, Michael and Sara flee from the scene but are separated in the process. Michael takes the blame for Kim's death and is sent to the Panamanian prison Sona. Ignorant of his brother's recapture, Lincoln searches for Michael and Sara in the season finale before spotting Sara traveling alone. In his last scene of the season, Lincoln tries to get her attention but loses her in the crowd.

=== Season 3 ===

Lincoln uses his free status to try to help [[Michael Scofield|Michael]] get out of [[Penitenciaría Federal de Sona|Sona Prison]]. He manages to get the [[consul]] to transfer Michael to a cleaner and safer [[prison]]. While explaining the situation, Michael instructed him to find [[Sara Tancredi|Sara]]. The local [[authority|authorities]] believe they've found Sara's body, which turned out not to be her. Lincoln is then called by his son [[LJ Burrows|LJ]] and is instructed to meet him and Sara at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], but instead he encounters a stranger calling herself [[Gretchen Morgan|Susan B. Anthony]] ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), who lets Lincoln know that Sara and LJ have been kidnapped and will be killed if Michael doesn't break out a man imprisoned in Sona named [[James Whistler (Prison Break character)|James Whistler]].

As Michael plots his escape, Lincoln does some sleuthing of his own on the outside: he follows Whistler's [[girlfriend]] [[Sofia Lugo]] and manages to acquire an [[ornithology]] guide with Whistler's notes in it. As Michael begins to have doubts, Lincoln takes matters into his own hands, tracking down Sara and LJ and knocking out two [[The Company (Prison Break)|Company]] agents before the other agents escape with their [[hostage]]s. Following his failed attempt, Lincoln receives what he believed to be Sara's head in a box. He decides not to tell Michael, who instructs Lincoln to recruit the [[grave digger]]. Lincoln is also forced to hand the real bird book to Susan. At the same time, [[Fernando Sucre]] and Sofia Lugo offer their assistance.
 
Lincoln goes about procuring a getaway [[vehicle]]. After finding the [[road]]s are heavily [[Patrol|guard]]ed, Linc buys some supplies at a [[dive shop]], and then goes with Sofia to the [[beach]], not far from the prison, where he buries them. Susan's threat of killing LJ forced Lincoln to back down and follow her orders, instead of trying to outsmart her. The next two episodes follow the escape plan and after the escape ultimately fails, Lincoln engages in a tense standoff with Susan to rescue L.J. but Lincoln is forced to back down again. Susan, while planning for the Bang and Burn operation, then sent Company agents to eliminate Sofia, Sucre and him but this ultimately fails. When the operation fails, Susan decided to try to get Lincoln back into the plan by letting him see LJ.

While figuring out the escape plan, Lincoln goes about buying a [[bomb]] to plan an explosive finish for Susan and tried to use Sucre to trick her, but both attempts ultimately fail. Sucre and [[Maricruz Delgado|Maricruz]] were also implicated as a result, though without Lincoln's knowing. Later on, Susan used Sofia as a hostage. That night, Lincoln steals a [[bus]] to knock out the power lines to Sona Prison, which then starts off the escape of Michael and the other inmates inside Sona Prison. The escape is eventually successful, with Lincoln joining the inmates and [[Luis Gallego|McGrady]] parting off with his dad in separate ways. Whistler later tried to escape, but Lincoln managed to get hold of him, forcing Gretchen to carry out the hostage exchange successfully at a [[museum]]. Later on, Gretchen's men open fire on police, so that Gretchen and Whistler could escape unharmed but the firing caused Sofia to be shot.

In the [[The Art of the Deal|season finale]], Lincoln, LJ and Sofia were last seen at the [[hospital]], where LJ is tending to Sofia's wounds.

===Season 4===

Lincoln is first seen with LJ and Sofia in a restaurant in Panama. When a confused Michael calls him and asks if he is sure that he saw Sara's head in the box, he says he did. Lincoln is later attacked by a Company agent, Lincoln kills him, which leads him to being arrested and extradited. When brought to America and reunited with Michael. They meet Donald Self, a homeland security agent, who gives him along with Michael, Sucre, Mahone, and Bellick two choices: either go back to jail or bring down The Company. When Lincoln is first put with the other convicts, Michael, Sara, Bellick, Sucre, Roland and Mahone he isn't happy to be stuck with the bunch only caring for his younger brother and Sara and having some good feelings towards Sucre. He and Bellick rarely exchange words but Roland often gets on his nerves and he doesn't like the kid, only putting up with him because he's the computer nerd and without him the cons could only do half a job. Mahone is a different story, he swears revenge of his father's death once they fulfill Self's mission. When Lincoln overhears a phone call in which Mahone tells Lang the company killed his son Lincoln relates to the man (the company tried to kill LJ previously) and promises Mahone that after the mission, together they would track down the person(s) who killed Cameron. Lincoln forms a fondness for Mahone and realizes the two aren't as different as he initially thought and although he can't forgive the other man for killing his father he has grown sympathetic towards him. He also has a good relationship with Bellick eventually because Bellick on several occasions saved his life, like in &quot;Eagles and Angels&quot; when Bellick distracts a Company goon about to kill Lincoln.

In the episode &quot;Quiet Riot&quot;, along with Michael, Sucre, and Mahone, Lincoln enters through the company HQ and reaches to the actual Scylla machine. In episode &quot;Selfless&quot; they are caught by the General and his goons, although that was the plan. The goons are about to shoot Michael, although they are held at gunpoint by Mahone and Sucre. Lincoln holds the General at gunpoint. The General is forced to give up his card, which he thinks is useless, although he is shocked when Michael shows him the other 5 Scylla cards. They take him hostage and later escape with Scylla, though they are betrayed by Self at the end of the episode. In the episode &quot;Deal Or No Deal&quot; Lincoln is captured by homeland security agents and agrees to testify against Self for immunity. Michael comes in and they are about to be killed by the Homeland Security agents, until a Company agent saves them by murdering the Homeland Security agents and is about to bring Michael and Lincoln to the General. Sucre sneaks up behind the agent and points the gun at the him and Lincoln takes the agent's weapon and kills him. In &quot;Just Business&quot;, he is worried about Michael's health as they keep trying to get Scylla back. Lincoln uses a rocket launcher to blast Self's hotel window. He runs to the alleyway, seeing Michael with a bloody nose and unconscious, picked up and thrown in a Company van. He goes to confront the General face to face and says he'll do anything to save Michael, even getting Scylla back to The Company. Lincoln tells Michael that he discovered that their mother had also worked for The Company and that he is going to get Scylla back for them to save Michael's life.

In the following episodes, Lincoln works on getting Scylla back, and is assigned a team by the general, consisting of Self, Gretchen and T-Bag. They are later joined by Mahone. When the general is displeased at their lack of progress, he sends photos of their loved ones, threatening to hurt them if the team does not find Scylla. Lincoln is also opposed by Michael, who seeks to find Scylla first and bring down The Company. The protagonists also learn that their mother, Christina Rose Scofield, is alive and that she is the one in possession of Scylla. In the episode “SOB”, Lincoln is framed by Christina for the murder of a high-ranking Indian official. Michael puts their differences aside, however, and rescues Lincoln. They escape from the police in “Cowboys and Indians”, and manages to steal Scylla from Christina. She responds by capturing Lincoln and shooting him in the lung, telling Michael that Lincoln will die if he doesn’t return Scylla to her. The episode ends with Michael having to decide between saving Sara or Linc. In the next episode he decides to save them both, and sends Mahone with an explosive device to kill Christina and rescue Lincoln while Michael saves Sara. The plan is successful. After they are unexpectedly contacted by Kellerman, he offers them complete exoneration if they hand over Scylla to a contact who is a member of the United Nations, which they do and are all exonerated. 

Following their exoneration, Michael’s nose begins to bleed, indicating that the tumor which was treated earlier in the series is back. In the series epilogue set 4 years later, Lincoln owns a scuba shop with Sofia. In his very last scene, Lincoln puts an origami crane on Michael's gravestone and walks off into the sunset with Mahone, Sucre, Michael's son (who is Lincoln's nephew), and Sara.

===''The Final Break''===
After hearing of the bounty on Sara's head in prison, Lincoln agrees to help Michael break her out. Lincoln, with Sucre, scope out the prison, taking measurements and photographs to create a map of the prison. Lincoln later goes to the men's prison attached to where Sara is, and attempts to convince T-Bag to set a fire at 7pm. T-Bag requests $100,000 to set the fire and instructs Lincoln who to steal the money from and how to get it, which he eventually steals for himself. At the end of the movie, Lincoln is shown on a boat moving to the Dominican Republic.

==Personality==
In the first two seasons Lincoln is revealed as very strong, both physically and mentally, and he shows himself as very threatening (to the point of fighting five of T-Bag's men single handedly to defend a CO during a riot) and intimidating. Despite that, he is revealed as unable to kill. After defeating Mahone in the episode &quot;Fin Del Camino&quot;, his hesitation to shoot him allows Mahone to regain the advantage and defeat him, causing him to tell Michael, &quot;Deep down, he's just like you. He has a heart that can't kill a man.&quot; In season three, Lincoln kills for the first time, shooting one of the Company operatives and appearing to have no remorse. 

In season four, Lincoln Burrows appears to have grown ruthless and cruel, acting just like a company agent (including the suit and gun), not hesitating to fire his gun and willing to torture people (seen when he rips out T-Bag's teeth). After the Company is taken down once and for all, Lincoln reverts to his original self, no longer a killer, but a family man once again.

==Concept and creation==

Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuide-2006aug08&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Prison-Break-DVD-38536.aspx |title=Prison Break DVD News, Season 2 Preview! |accessdate=17 January 2009 | last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |date=8 August 2006 |work=TV Guide|dead-url=yes}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on ''[[North Shore (TV series)|North Shore]]''. Since working on ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]'', Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of ''Prison Break''. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSMH-2006jan27&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Prison Break success shocks creator |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/prison-break-success-shocks-creator/2006/01/27/1138319425109.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |agency=Australian Associated Press |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=27 January 2006 |accessdate=19 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production details==
[[Paul Adelstein]], who plays Lincoln's nemesis for the first 35 episodes as [[Paul Kellerman]], originally auditioned for the role of Lincoln.
[[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] and [[Eric Dane]] were joint choices for the role but executives couldn't decide who to go with so they searched for someone else resulting in [[Dominic Purcell]]'s casting.

'''Bushwacker (Carl Burbank)''' is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Primarily an enemy of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], he is also an enemy of the [[Punisher]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=August 2016}}
Created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #248 (November 1987).

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[priest]], Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the [[C.I.A.]], which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename &quot;Bushwacker&quot;, but ultimately he became a freelancer.

At some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in &quot;the arts&quot;. Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Bushwacker was tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #249 (December 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Bushwacker joined with [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and other enemies of Daredevil in a plan to kill their common foe. After the completion of the plan, Bushwacker was left to his own activities.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #259-260 (October–November 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher, but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Punisher War Journal'' #12-13 (December 1989 – January 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert, who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter [[Ben Urich]], who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Bushwacker learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the exposé. However, the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker then killed him.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil Annual'' #5 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Bushwacker was later freed by [[Deathlok#Michael Collins|Deathlok]] from captivity by [[Mecha Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Deathlok'' #5 (November 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], the Punisher, [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. His clash with Nomad was over the life of a baby that Nomad had taken under his care whom Bushwacker believed to be the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law (she was in the fact the daughter of Nomad's foe, the drug lord Umberto Saffilios and a teenaged prostitute). Bushwacker hoped that his wife would approve of his &quot;rescue&quot; and welcome him back into her life.&lt;ref&gt;''Nomad'' #4-5 (August–September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprisoned in the super-villain holding facility the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]], Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]]. Burbank was subsequently employed by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] to kill the Punisher, but was defeated once again by Daredevil.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' #3 (October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Bushwacker created a disturbance in downtown Manhattan and took a woman hostage to lure the [[Punisher]] out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher showed up as expected. As it turns out, G.W. Bridge arranged the incident in Times Square with Bushwacker to ambush and capture The Punisher. Although complications arose by an on-site NYPD officer the incident fell through, the Punisher escaped, and Bushwacker was defeated by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operative [[G. W. Bridge]] and put back in jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2, #5 (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the Skrull invading force in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #6 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He was with the Hood when he presented the [[Mac Gargan#Scorpion|Scorpion costume]] to whichever crook impressed him until the party was crashed by [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Scorpion]], who stole the costume.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #626 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushwacker was seen during the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] as part of the Hood crime syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #63 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[X-Force]]: Sex and Violence'' #2, Bushwacker was apparently killed by Wolverine after an assassination attempt on him and Domino. He was killed with a middle claw to the throat.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force: Sex and Violence'' #2 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Kingpin encounters Bushwacker in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II: Kingpin'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Bushwacker's right arm has been altered bionically so that it can function as a gun. He can fire bullets from his index finger as if his hand were a pistol. Using his left hand, he can alter the configuration of his right arm, allowing it to function in several modes that replicate the effects of a number of weapons, including a machine gun and a shotgun. He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo, such as bullets or flamethrower fuel. Bushwacker's skin can liquefy to seal wounds. There are some versions that take this a step further, having Bushwacker be able to use highly concussive energy weaponry (very similar to that of Iron Man or War Machine), and even be able to morph his arm into blades as a last resort.

In the ''Daredevil vs. Punisher'' miniseries, it was implied that his powers are actually a natural mutation, making the assassin himself one of the mutants he hates so much.{{issue|date=May 2012}} However, this is contradicted by his other appearances which identify the origins of his powers as cybernetics.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

Bushwacker has been trained in CIA hand-to-hand combat techniques, and is trained in infiltration and assassination. He also has familiarity with the workings of international intelligence agencies and their methods.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Bushwacker appeared in the [[House of M]] reality spin-off ''House of M: Masters of Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1-4 (October 2009 – January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janine Butcher''' (also '''Evans''' and '''Malloy''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', introduced in 1989. The character was played by Rebecca Michael from 1989 to 1993, Alexia Demetriou from 1993 to 1996, and [[Charlie Brooks]] from 1999 to 2014. Brooks originally left in 2004, but returned for a three episode guest stint in April 2008, after which she agreed to return full-time, returning in December 2008. Brooks then took a break in 2012, with the character off-screen from September 2012 until April 2013. She later departed again, with the character making her final appearance on 20 March 2014.

Janine's storylines included [[prostitution]], [[drug addiction]], financial worries, becoming an [[agoraphobia|agoraphobe]] and being falsely charged with the murder of [[Laura Beale]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]). The character is the widow of [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]] ([[Shaun Williamson]]), [[David (EastEnders)|David]] ([[Harry Towb]]) and [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]) and is divorced from [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]). During June 2012 Janine prematurely gave birth to a daughter, Scarlett, on the day of her wedding to Michael. The pair later separate and become embroiled in a custody battle over Scarlett, which leads to Janine murdering Michael in October 2013, facilitating her third departure from the show.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Janine's mother, June, died of cancer when Janine was three and she moved in with her sister [[Clare Butcher|Clare]] (Lucy Foxell; Caroline O'Neill). Her father [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) moved to [[Walford]] with her older siblings [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Diane Butcher|Diane]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]) and married [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Clare moved to Manchester in 1989, leaving Janine with Pat and Frank.

===1989–2004===
A troublesome child, Janine throws tantrums, runs away, is a bed-wetter, a sleepwalker, a thief, a compulsive liar and self-harmer and hates Pat. Unable to discipline her, Pat forces Frank to take Janine to family therapy, which helps somewhat. When Frank has a breakdown and disappears in 1994, Janine stays with Pat but finds her father's absence upsetting. She is overjoyed when Frank returns and they move to Manchester in 1996. However, Frank returns to Walford in 1998, leaving Janine with Clare.

Janine returns in 1999 to live with Frank and his new wife, [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). She sets about coming between them, constantly trying to antagonise Frank with rebellious behaviour. She sleeps with [[Jamie Mitchell]] ([[Jack Ryder (actor)|Jack Ryder]]) to infuriate her father then humiliates Jamie by spreading rumours about his inadequate prowess in bed. Frank abandons Janine in 2000 after the breakdown of his marriage to Peggy. Homeless, Janine is taken in by [[Terry Raymond]] ([[Gavin Richards]]); they start a business together as estate agents. Terry sees Janine as a surrogate daughter but her constant manipulation tests his patience. Janine uses him for money, deliberately dresses like his late daughter [[Tiffany Mitchell]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]), ruins his relationships with women and tries to seduce him. Janine also has a relationship with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) until he runs out of money. This behaviour infuriates Terry but Janine starts using [[cocaine]], pestering Terry for money to feed her habit. When he refuses, she resorts to sex with her drug dealer, Lee Vickers (Dermot Keaney), in exchange for cocaine; Vickers beats Terry when he tries to warn him off. When he sees Janine's lack of remorse, Terry throws her out and leaves Walford, ignoring her pleas for him to stay. Owing Vickers money for drugs, Janine turns to [[prostitution]] under the pseudonym &quot;Blonde Bombshell&quot;. One of her clients, Matt Lindsay ([[Matthew Steer]]), falls in love with her and proposes but attempts suicide when he learns she is still a prostitute. [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) begins using her services but she blackmails him, threatening to tell his wife [[Laura Beale|Laura]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]) unless he pays her. Depressed, Janine begins drinking heavily and nearly dies of alcohol poisoning. She gives up prostitution, but when Laura discovers that she has been having sex with Ian, she throws a pan of boiling milk in Janine's face. Janine becomes [[agoraphobic]] as a result&amp;nbsp;— she eats [[dog food]] because she is too afraid to go out and buy groceries. She eventually gets over this with Billy's help. Janine hopes to rekindle their relationship but is devastated when he tells her that he is in love with [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Slater]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]). Her attempts to ruin their blossoming romance fail.

Janine gets a job working at [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry Evans]]'s ([[Shaun Williamson]]) car lot when she becomes friendly with Barry, after his father [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) dies from a heart attack. She and [[Paul Trueman]] ([[Gary Beadle]]) concoct a plan to fleece Barry of his money. She seduces Barry and moves in with him but continues to sleep with Paul too. Barry eventually proposes to Janine and she accepts, thinking that Barry has a life-threatening [[heart murmur]]. They marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in Scotland, but Janine is furious to discover that Barry's illness is a false alarm. Barry forces Janine to take a stroll around the hills and cliffs, but Janine cracks and admits everything. Barry refuses to believe that she does not love him and tries to embrace her. Repulsed, Janine pushes him away and he falls down a hill, fatally hitting his head on a rock; Janine watches him die.
[[File:Janine Butcher and Barry Evans.jpg|right|thumb||200px|Janine pushes [[Barry Evans (EastEnders)|Barry]] to his death (2004)]]
Janine inherits Barry's estate and has Barry cremated in Scotland, denying his friends and family a chance to pay their respects, making Barry's ex-wife, [[Natalie Evans|Natalie]] ([[Lucy Speed]]), suspicious. Natalie becomes close to Paul Trueman, who feels guilty about his role in Barry's death. Spurred on by Natalie, Paul eventually makes a statement to the police, implicating Janine in Barry's death. She is arrested but released without charge, due to lack of evidence, and spitefully tells Natalie that she has got away with murder but telling Pat is her downfall. Pat is also good friends with Laura, who has a feud with Janine. Janine further angers the locals by reporting Laura for benefit fraud and announces it in The Vic. Janine and Laura are seen fighting just before Laura accidentally dies after falling down the stairs. It is noted in the post mortem that Laura had recently been in a fight, due to bruising and Janine's skin is found under her nails. Although Janine was with Pat when Laura died, Pat avenges Barry by refusing to give Janine an alibi despite her begging for help and blaming her actions on her hard childhood but Pat brands her &quot;''pure evil''&quot;. In desperation, Janine goes to Paul and offers to sleep with him in return for an alibi, but Paul throws her out, and she is arrested by the police as she tries to leave the square with a bag of money. Janine is then charged with Laura's murder and remanded in custody in May 2004.

Janine stands trial off-screen in 2005 and Frank tries to persuade Pat to tell the truth in court, giving Janine an alibi. Pat refuses but a conversation with Laura's mother, [[Edwina Dunn|Edwina]] ([[Gay Hamilton]]), forces Pat to tell the court what really happened. Janine is released but leaves Frank outside the courtroom.

===2008–2014===
Janine returns for Frank's funeral and is angry that he has not left money in his will; she scatters his ashes before departing. Pat and Ricky later discover that Janine is masquerading as a Jewish orphan named &quot;Judith Bernstein&quot; so she can marry an elderly Jewish man named [[David (EastEnders)|David]] ([[Harry Towb]]) for his money. They trace Janine to a synagogue, where, just after Janine and David are married, Pat declares that Janine is &quot;as Jewish as a bacon sandwich&quot;. David has a heart attack and dies, and a now homeless Janine has no choice but to return to Walford.

She makes various enemies, among them [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), whom Janine drugs and then restrains so she can gain a taped confession of his past misdemeanours, which she uses as blackmail to gain control of Walford's car lot. Pat and Jack usurp her, reclaiming the business. In need of money, Janine teams up with [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]); they make plans to ruin the Mitchell family by taking [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] from them. When they manipulate [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) into breaking her bail terms, the Mitchells lose bail surety and face financial ruin. Ian provides the Mitchells with a loan on condition they use their pub as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Janine has sex with Ian recording the tryst, then blackmails him, threatening to show his wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) unless he sells the Mitchell loan to Archie. Archie subsequently takes control of The Vic when the Mitchells are unable to meet the terms of the loan.

Meanwhile, Janine and her flat mate [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]])—with whom Janine is having sex—plan to fleece Archie. Archie and Janine announce their engagement, but on Christmas Day, Archie—who has realised Janine is intending to con him—throws her onto the street, leaving her distraught. That same day, Archie is murdered by an unknown assailant (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]). Janine becomes a suspect for his murder, though she denies it and feigns distress over Archie's death. While she attempts to frame Ian and the Mitchells for the murder, Peggy attempts to frame her, planting evidence in her flat, which leads to an arrest but no charge. In the end, Janine is cleared and [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]) is held falsely responsible for the murder, although, unknown to everyone, Bradley's wife [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) is Archie's actual killer.

When Ryan confesses his love for Janine, she recoils, but when he attempts to leave Walford, she admits she loves him too. Despite Janine nearly straying on her hen night, she and Ryan marry, but marital happiness is short-lived when Ryan discovers he is the father of Stacey's daughter [[Lily Branning|Lily]]. A feud erupts between Janine and Stacey when Janine reports her to Social Services for neglecting Lily. Later, Janine kidnaps Lily, suggesting to Ryan they leave Walford with the child to separate Ryan from Stacey. Her games push Ryan and Stacey closer together and they begin an affair. When Janine finds out, she vows to kill them both. She buys sedatives and poisons Ryan. He is left bedridden but manages to escape and ends their marriage publicly after being released from hospital. Hurt and angry, Janine discovers Stacey is Archie's murderer and goes public with this, but is largely ignored with no concrete evidence. Desperate, Janine visits Stacey; she stabs herself to try to frame Stacey for her own attempted murder, but Stacey escapes the country before arrest. Blaming Janine for Stacey's departure, Ryan refuses to reunite with Janine and attempts to kill her by removing her oxygen tubing when she is hospitalised. She is saved by Ricky's chance arrival, but both Ricky and Pat denounce Janine's actions when she admits her injuries are self-inflicted.

Ricky and Janine receive news that their maternal rich grandmother, [[Lydia Simmonds]] ([[Margaret Tyzack]]/[[Heather Chasen]]), is ill and in need of care. Janine takes her grandmother in, with the ulterior motive of inheriting her fortune. Janine learns that Lydia is very similar to herself and they both put on an act of hating each other. Janine eventually admits she loves her grandmother, but Lydia's health quickly deteriorates. Janine discovers Lydia has left all her money to charity, but admits to Lydia she no longer cares during a heartfelt conversation. Before she dies, Lydia explains that she wanted to look after Janine after her mother died but Pat and Frank wouldn't allow it. Janine is devastated by Lydia's death but her family, including Pat, accuse her of killing her. On Ryan's behest, Janine is questioned by police, but released without charge and Janine is stunned when she inherits Lydia's estate, making her a millionaire. Janine later happily achieves full closure from Ryan after learning that he has fled Walford.

Janine buys various properties and businesses; she starts a property management company and a women's fitness centre with her boyfriend [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] ([[Steve John Shepherd]]). She also buys a share in the nightclub [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|R&amp;R]], making [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) her reluctant partner; both clash over the running of the club. When Pat needs money to pay debts, Janine gives her a loan, insisting Pat use her house as collateral. She later brings the loan payment deadline forward, refusing to believe Pat is dying. Despite a period of animosity, Janine makes peace with Pat before her death, with Pat convincing a pregnant Janine to keep Michael's child. Janine accepts Michael's marriage proposal after he reluctantly agrees to sign a [[prenuptial agreement]]. When [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) tells everyone, including Janine, that Michael stole her money and lied to her, Janine refuses to believe Jean's claims and dismisses them because Jean is [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]]. However, Janine's enemy [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) returns and demands Janine repay the funds or she goes to the police. Michael eventually confesses the truth to Janine on her wedding day and offers her ultimatum: that she rip up the prenuptial agreement or the wedding is off. Janine is torn between the two but eventually agrees to cancel the pre-nup; Janine and Michael marry but she goes into labour 11 weeks early at the wedding reception. At the hospital, Janine undergoes a cesarean and her daughter is put into an incubator, which distresses Janine who wants to see her. The baby is named [[Scarlett Moon|Scarlett]] but after a breakdown with Ricky, she decides to change Scarlett's name to Patricia in memory of Pat and has her christened.

Janine hopes to make peace with Jean so writes her a cheque for double what she is owed, however, Michael tears it up and pays her the correct amount, plus £1000 from Janine. Janine later begins to doubt Michael's intent when he asks to be a signatory on the business accounts and buys a sports car, so orders Billy to change the combination on the office safe. Michael's strange behaviour continues, leaving Janine convinced he is having an affair. She confronts him, offering him a suitcase of money and saying that if he really loves her, he will refuse to take it. Michael is furious and tells Janine that she cannot hope to be a good mother to their baby. Believing him to be right, Janine packs her bags and hands Scarlett to Michael, taking the money and leaving. Michael is informed that Janine has transferred all the money from her bank accounts and has ordered that her business Butcher's Joints be closed down, transferring all her properties over to another estate agent, leaving Michael with nothing.

Several months later, Janine returns to Walford and visits Michael, where Kat tells her how Michael has coped without her. Janine tells Michael that she is back for Scarlett, and says he will be hearing from her lawyer. Janine manipulates Michael into giving her custody of Scarlett and she denies Michael parental access. She then hires Michael's former nanny, [[Alice Branning]]  ([[Jasmyn Banks]]) to look after Scarlett, pleasing Michael as Alice is on his side. When Janine catches Alice stealing jewellery from her house, Alice explains she is stressed because Michael is putting demands on her to see Scarlett, and she has been letting him do so. Janine agrees that it is better for Scarlett in the long-run to have a relationship with both her parents. At Ian's restaurant opening, Janine, as an investor, has the sign and name of the restaurant changed from &quot;Ian Beale @ Le Square&quot; to &quot;Scarlett's&quot; which pleases Michael. They apparently call a truce, but Janine then leaves in a car with Scarlett, telling Michael that she may never return.

Michael eventually tracks Janine down and she returns to Walford. She employs [[Danny Pennant]] ([[Gary Lucy]]), who Michael is jealous of, and buys a share in Michael's boxing club. Janine has sex with Danny but tells him that it is a one off. She rehires Alice as her nanny, unaware that she is still being manipulated by Michael, but fires her again when she tells Janine that she had sex with Michael. The increasing animosity between Janine and Michael leads to her taking out an injunction out against him. Michael then begins a plot to kill Janine, and involves Alice in his plans. Alice has second thoughts and tells Janine of Michael's plans. When Janine confronts Michael he tries to strangle her, leading to Alice stabbing Michael in the back to stop him. Alice then leaves to answer the door, but realising Michael is still alive, Janine stabs him again in the stomach, killing him. Alice believes she killed him, and Janine tells the police that Alice stabbed Michael twice and also attacked her, and tells Alice that the real story is something her mind created. Alice's brother, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), seduces a lonely Janine in a bid to extract the truth from her, but fails. Janine's former step-brother [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]) suspects that Janine is guilty of the murder, so he manipulates her into allowing him to stay at her house, and then into admitting that she killed Michael. David promises to keep her secret, but has secretly recorded the confession on his phone. Meanwhile, Janine is planning to buy The Vic and sells her share of R&amp;R and her car to do so. David then reveals the recording to Janine and blackmails her into giving him the £250,000 she has raised. Janine panics and tries to kill David by hitting him with a car. However, he suffers only minor injuries. After she hands over the cash, he threatens to call the police anyway. She convinces him to give her a day to get away, but [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) finds David's phone and plays the confession. She gives the phone to Joey, who calls the police and Janine is arrested for Michael's murder, and is dragged away by the police, sobbing hysterically.

In February 2014, Kat visits Janine in prison and tries to convince her to drop her statement against Stacey. Janine agrees on the condition that Kat provides her with a false witness testimony to Michael's murder, backing up Janine's story that Alice killed him. Kat agrees and does so. At the trial, when Janine hears that Alice has tried to kill herself, she tells the truth. The jury return a not guilty verdict for both Alice and Janine. She returns briefly to Walford and tries to make amends with the people in The Vic, but everyone including Carol is completely hostile towards her and she leaves. Janine then leaves for Paris to join Scarlett and Diane, and it is hinted that she is plans to con a married couple who have won the lottery.

==Creation and development==
===Introduction and recasts===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
The character was first mentioned in September 1987, when her father [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) first appeared on-screen. Frank and his children [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Diane Butcher]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]) were introduced as regular characters in 1988. However, Janine did not become a regular character until a year later, in June 1989, her arrival completing the Butcher family.

[[File:Janine Butcher Young.JPG|160px|left|thumb|Rebecca Michael played Janine originally from 1989-1993.]]
Janine was initially seen as a 6-year-old, played by Rebecca Michael. In 1993, following a storyline that saw her stepmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) imprisoned for manslaughter, Janine was sent to stay with her off-screen sister [[Clare Butcher]], but she returned later that year, played by 11-year-old Alexia Demetriou who reigned as Janine from 14 October 1993 until 12 March 1996, when the character was written out again, as Demetriou left to concentrate on her studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+soaps'+lost+children%3b+HOW+YOUNG+STARS+COPED+WHEN+AXE+FELL+ON+FAME.-a073966802|title= The soaps' lost children; HOW YOUNG STARS COPED WHEN AXE FELL ON FAME.|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' | date = 2 May 2001| accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] re-introduced Janine in 1999 as a 16-year-old played by [[Charlie Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Matthew+Wright+Column%3a+Janine+Mk+3%3b+EastEnders'+Butcher+kid+is...-a060449137|title= Janine Mk 3; EastEnders' Butcher kid is biggest TV clone.|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' | date = 24 June 1999| accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterisation===
{{Expand section|date=April 2017}}
Janine's storylines typically involve her in an antagonistic role; the character has been described as a &quot;super-bitch&quot; and a &quot;classic villainess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/12/04/eastenders-super-bitch-janine-butcher-will-return-to-show-for-christmas-picture-exclusive-115875-20944010/|title=EastEnders super-bitch Janine Butcher will return to show for Christmas: Picture exclusive|publisher=The Mirror|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen Boyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Larry Jaffee|title=Media and violence|year=2005|publisher=Social Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Drug addiction, departure and 2008 return===
In 2002, a storyline saw Janine using drugs and prostituting to fund the habit. She was shown about to snort cocaine in a scene that sparked viewer complaints to the BBC. Brooks has said about Janine's behavior: &quot;Sleeping with her pusher is very sad and desperate. But she feels she has to do it to get more drugs. Janine has such low self-esteem that she's deliberately reckless. She thinks, 'Why not take drugs if they make me feel good about myself for a while?' I think she knows she's on a slippery slope but she believes she can get out of it like she's always done before.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coke&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BBC+defends+sex+and+drugs+EastEnders+story.-a083105761|title=BBC defends sex and drugs EastEnders story.|publisher=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=20 February 2002|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks left the show in 2004 but returned in 2008, originally for a three-episode guest stint.{{Fact|date=April 2017}} In June 2009 she signed a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a161677/brooks-signs-to-enders-for-three-more-years.html|title=Brooks signs to 'Enders for three more years|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=23 June 2009|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ryan Malloy===
In December 2009, the show's executive producer, [[Diederick Santer]] teased about upcoming storylines involving Janine and her flatmate [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), saying: &quot;There's something really interesting with Ryan and Janine [...]. They're both people who don't know how to love. So will they fall in love? And if they do, can they cope with it? Will they understand the alien feelings coursing through their bodies?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a189597/eastenders-exec-teases-2010-storylines.html|title='EastEnders' exec teases 2010 storylines|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, Janine proposes to Ryan. Brooks said that the idea of getting married would be daunting for the character, but added that she believes Janine is genuinely in love with Ryan. She commented: &quot;It's easy to assume that Janine is playing games or using him for sex, but [...] Ryan clearly adores her too, so he may be the man to tame her wild ways.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Janine in love&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a256952/brooks-janine-is-in-love-with-ryan.html|title=Brooks: 'Janine is in love with Ryan'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=6 August 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=6 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks hinted at possible trouble for the couple if Janine discovers that Ryan fathered a baby with [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), saying &quot;Janine will be absolutely destroyed when she finds out. She wants Ryan all to herself, and the idea of a baby snatching his attention away would be devastating. All she needs is to be loved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Janine in love&quot; /&gt; McDermott stated that he believed Ryan was the right man for Janine, and that they could be perfect for each other, saying: &quot;Janine's never loved any of the men she's been with before. She has only ever been in it for the money. Ryan understands her and knows why she does the things she does. They both forgive one another's mistakes very easily, and that's why their partnership works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/165495-ryan-malloy-right-for-janine/ |title=Ryan Malloy 'right' for Janine |date=24 March 2010 |publisher=[[STV (TV network)|STV]] |accessdate=31 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717035929/http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/165495-ryan-malloy-right-for-janine/ |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lydia Simmonds===
In February 2011, Janine's estranged grandmother, [[Lydia Simmonds]], &quot;a lady of class and dignity,&quot; was announced. Lydia's backstory states that she loved her daughter June but hated the man she married, Frank, so she grew old alone. Lydia and Janine have been estranged for many years and Janine is shocked to have her grandmother back in her life. Executive Producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] said: &quot;I can't wait to see Janine meet her match.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lydia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/02/margaret-tyzack.shtml|title=Janine's in for a shock... from Grandma|last=Humphreys|first=Matt|date=15 February 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=15 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breaks and 2014 departure===
In February 2012, Brooks announced that she would take a six-month break from the show later in the year, and departed on 14 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Charlie Brooks to take soap break, tipped for 'Strictly'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a366324/eastenders-charlie-brooks-to-take-soap-break-tipped-for-strictly.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|date=17 February 2010|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/sitenews/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html |title=Soapland's joiners, movers and leavers |publisher=Digital Spy |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks returned to filming on 21 February 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CharlieBrooks0/status/304554654761631744|title=Twitter / CharlieBrooks0: Back to work today after 6 ...|publisher=Charlie Brooks, [[Twitter]]|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned on screen on 18 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a468870/janine-returns-to-albert-square.html |title=Janine returns to Albert Square |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=27 March 2013 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]] |accessdate=27 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329202014/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a468870/janine-returns-to-albert-square.html |archivedate=29 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2013, it was announced that Brooks had decided to leave the show for a third time but to allow for her to return again, the character would not be killed-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methven, Nicola&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/charlie-brooks-quit-eastenders-role-2648031 | title=Charlie Brooks to quit EastEnders role as Janine Butcher but WON'T be killed off | work=Mirror | date=28 October 2013 | accessdate=25 December 2013 | author=Methven, Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Janine's arrest on Christmas Day, she returned to screens on 24 February 2014 when [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) visited her in prison, and last appeared on 20 March 2014.

==Reception==
Janine has been well received by critics although some of her storylines have come under criticism. In 2001, it was reported that education experts blamed delinquent young characters in soap operas, like Janine, for increasing disorder and violence in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MEET+THE+SOAP+ROGUE+MODELS%3b+Education+experts+say+that+characters...-a072260850|title=MEET THE SOAP ROGUE MODELS; Education experts say that characters like these are increasing disorder and violence in schools.|publisher=Sunday Mercury|date=25 March 2001|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, scenes involving the character were the source of viewer complaints, when Janine prostituted herself to pay for cocaine that she was about to snort. Television watchdog Mediawatch UK claimed &quot;the scenes were another example of the gradual erosion of standards of taste and decency&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-101280/EastEnders-drug-storm.html|title=EastEnders drug storm|publisher=Daily Mail|date=20 February 2002|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tory MP [[Tim Yeo]] also chastised the scenes saying, &quot;The makers of a programme as popular and influential as ''EastEnders'', particular on a public service channel, have a duty to be responsible in terms of not glamorising drug-taking, especially when a young audience is watching.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;/&gt; [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Nick Harvey]] added, &quot;No one can deny these things go on in real life. But showing them before the watershed to an audience appreciably younger than the people it's happening to normalises these things and de-sensitizes people to the shock of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;/&gt; The BBC defended the storyline, saying, &quot;Although the storyline implied Janine had taken drugs, there were no scenes that actually showed her using them. ''EastEnders'' has always tackled difficult issues like drug-taking in a responsible way, mindful of its responsibilities to its younger audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;coke&quot;/&gt;
===Awards and nominations===
Brooks was awarded &quot;Best Bitch&quot; at the [[Inside Soap Awards]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/QUEEN+BITCH%3b+Janine+named+as+most+evil+woman+of+all+TV+soaps.-a078818892|title=QUEEN BITCH; Janine named as most evil woman of all TV soaps|publisher=Daily Record|date=2 October 2001|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Brooks won the &quot;Bad Girl&quot; award at the 2009 [[All About Soap]] Bubble Awards, which are voted for by the public, for her portrayal of Janine, saying: &quot;I'm thrilled that viewers think I am so good at being bad!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20090327.shtml|title=EastEnders scoop up Bubbles Awards! |publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=31 March 2009|accessdate=6 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403202922/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20090327.shtml|archivedate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks also won Villain of the Year at the [[The British Soap Awards|British Soap Awards]] in 2004 for her portrayal of the same character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a14385/british-soap-awards-2004-winners-list.html|title=British Soap Awards 2004 - winners list|publisher=Digital spy|date=8 May 2004|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated in the same category in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|title=British Soap Awards 2011 voting opens|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=7 March 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks won her third Inside Soap Award for Best Bitch in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.sky.com/inside-soap-award-winners-2009 |title=Inside Soap Award Winners 2009 |publisher=Sky.com |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003005153/http://tv.sky.com/inside-soap-award-winners-2009 |archivedate=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, the love triangle storyline between Janine, Ryan and Stacey was nominated in the &quot;Best Love Triangle&quot; category at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;bubble2011noms&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a303447/in-full-all-about-soap-bubble-nominations.html|title=In Full: All About Soap Bubble nominations|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=14 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won the award for &quot;Best Bitch&quot; at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/2012-winners |title=2012 Winners « Inside Soap Magazine |publisher=Insidesoap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214054907/http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/2012-winners |archivedate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Brooks won &quot;Best Female Soap Actor&quot; with 23.0% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders', Corrie, 'Hollyoaks' all win in Digital Spy's 2012 poll|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a446819/eastenders-corrie-hollyoaks-all-win-in-digital-spys-2012-poll.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Max-cady.jpg|thumb|200px|Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|remake]].]]
In both film versions of MacDonald's novel, Cady is a criminal with an obsessive grudge against an attorney named Sam Bowden (played by [[Gregory Peck]] in the first film and by [[Nick Nolte]] in the remake) who sent him to [[prison]] for [[rape]]. While in prison, Cady teaches himself to read as he nurtures his hatred of Bowden, made especially intense when his wife [[divorce]]s him and takes their child. Upon his release, he terrorizes Bowden and his family, [[stalking]] his wife at their house and attempting to seduce Bowden's teenaged daughter. After Bowden's failed attempts to get rid of Cady with [[bribery]] and a [[restraining order]], he hires street thugs to rough Cady up, which only succeeds in making him angrier and more determined to make sure Bowden &quot;learns all about loss&quot;. Cady tracks the family to its summer home in the titular [[North Carolina]] beach town of Cape Fear and nearly kills them all. In the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the first film, Bowden puts Cady under [[citizen's arrest]]; in the second, Cady apparently drowns after a fight with Bowden.

===Differences between the films===
Significant differences are seen between the way in which Cady is portrayed in the original film and the remake. Mitchum's characterization is that of a sleazy, degenerate [[con artist]]. De Niro's is of a homicidal [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], who viciously attacks everything and everyone Bowden holds dear (he even beats and rapes one of Bowden's colleagues). The remake also sheds some light on Cady's background in a rural [[Pentecostal]] family who does [[snake handling]] and drank [[strychnine]]  to achieve [[religious ecstasy]]. 

Also, many differences occur in the films' portrayals of Cady and Bowden's relationship. In the first film, Bowden merely [[testimony|testified]] against Cady in court. In the remake, Bowden was Cady's attorney who deliberately suppressed evidence which may have lightened Cady's sentence or granted him an [[acquittal]]. Most notably, Cady's fate differs in the two films. In the 1962 version, Bowden manages to grab his revolver and shoot Cady in the leg during a fight between the two men. Rather than finish him off, Bowden spares Cady so he will be forced to spend the rest of his life in jail.
 
In the remake, Bowden is able to handcuff Cady's ankle to a railing in the houseboat before it hits submerged rocks and begins to break apart. The two exchange blows with rocks, and Bowden savagely attempts to bring a large rock down on Cady's head. Before he can do so, though, Cady is washed out into the river, still cuffed to part of the houseboat, madly crying out and [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]], and Bowden then watches as Cady is pulled to the bottom of the river and drowns.

===Differences between the book and the films===

In the novel by John D. MacDonald, Sam testified against Max back in [[World War II]], since he witnessed the latter raping a fourteen-year-old girl when he was stationed in [[Australia]]. Max was sentenced to life at a hard labor prison camp but was released thirteen years later. Max nurtured his grudge against Sam during his time which exacerbated due to his wife divorcing him and his only son dying in an accident. Unlike the films, Max refers to Sam as &quot;lieutenant&quot; instead of &quot;counselor&quot;.

Max's background differs from the films in that he hails from [[West Virginia]] and has three brothers, all of whom were criminals (with one killed during a prison riot). They are not religious zealots like in the 1991 film. However, in the book, Max is very much a violent psychopath who has no remorse for anything he does which includes, among many other despicable acts, shooting one of Sam's children with a rifle. He is determined to kill Sam &quot;six times&quot;. 

Cady's fate in the book is being shot by Sam as he flees from their home after attacking Sam's wife. In the wee hours of the morning during a police search, his body is found in the woods behind the Bowden home. He died of excessive blood loss from two of Sam's shots.

==Cultural impact==
*Mitchum's portrayal of Cady ranks number 28 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|list of the top 50 movie villains of all time]].
*Cady was parodied in a 1993 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled &quot;[[Cape Feare]]&quot;, in which [[Sideshow Bob]] stalks the Simpson family to a lake town to get revenge on [[Bart Simpson|Bart]].
*De Niro's portrayal of Cady was the inspiration for professional wrestler [[Dan Spivey]]'s Waylon Mercy character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=Ryan |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/spiveypart2 |title=Dan Spivey: Part 2 |publisher=WWE.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Windham Rotunda, another professional wrestler, portrays a character named [[Bray Wyatt]], who is also loosely modeled after De Niro's version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics, not fans, should bite their tongues|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2013/07/15/pf-20975591.html|publisher=Slam!

'''David Cain''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{DC Universe}}.  He first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #567 (July 1999), and  was created by [[Kelley Puckett]] and [[Damion Scott]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Cain, David | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 64  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===The assassin===

David Cain is one of the world's premier [[assassination|assassin]]s, whose victims have included some of the most famous and powerful people on the planet. He trained the young Bruce Wayne with some of the skills that he would use as Batman, although Bruce has never used some of the more lethal techniques Cain taught him and has since surpassed his teacher in ability. Regarding his decision to train with an assassin, Batman explained, &quot;Knowing ''how'' to kill doesn't mean you ''must'' kill.&quot;

Cain desired a perfect partner with whom to carry out his assassination plans. Attempts to train young children resulted in failure, so he decided to conceive one himself. He found the perfect mother in a martial artist named Sandra Wu-San. He watched her duel her sister at a tournament and concluded that it was her sister Carolyn that was holding Sandra back from her full potential. He murdered Carolyn and ambushed Sandra with the help of [[Ra's al Ghul]] and his League of Assassins. In exchange for sparing her life, Sandra agreed to bear David's child and leave the child in his care for him to train.

The child, [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra]], would be Cain's &quot;One Who Is All,&quot; whose native tongue was one-on-one combat and ability to read people's intentions simply by their body language. The latter was a special gift that only the Wu-San sisters and Cassandra knew. After bearing his child, Sandra set out to become [[Lady Shiva]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

===The father===

Cain trained Cassandra in every imaginable form of violence, from hand-to-hand combat to weapons and explosives. Cain never taught her to read or write, and even avoided speaking in her presence; her only language was her ability to read people and predict what her opponents were going to do. His training methods were tantamount to child abuse. When she was 8 years old, Cain took her to kill a businessman. After she did, she &quot;read&quot; him as he died, she saw death as the man saw it.  &quot;Terror and then... nothing&quot;. It was this reading that made her decide that murder was wrong and she ran away from Cain, Cain musing in hindsight that he simply pushed her too far too young.

Cain was first introduced into the Batman universe in the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' (1999) comic book arc. [[Two-Face]] hires him to assassinate [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. Cassandra spots him and saves Gordon's life. After she has burned Two-Face's money to void the contract and refuses to come back to him, Cain leaves Gotham, briefly tearful at hearing his daughter's first word (&quot;Stop&quot;). He later broadcasts a video into the [[Batcave]] that reveals what Cassandra had done years ago, but Batman continues to trust her when she deliberately charges towards an armed opponent to save an innocent man, explaining that her reason for doing so was instinct.

===Framing Bruce Wayne===

[[Lex Luthor]] hired Cain to frame [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] for the murder of [[Vesper Fairchild]], however Cain had an ulterior motive; determining whether or not Batman was worthy enough of raising Cassandra.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-vesp&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Fairchild, Vesper | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 118  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having realised that Bruce was Batman, Cain not only framed Bruce Wayne for Vesper's murder, but planted a complex sequence of evidence to suggest that Wayne killed her because she had deduced Batman's true identity, infiltrating the Batcave and doctoring and then erasing Vesper's electronic journal in such a manner that only the Bat-family could determine what he had done. Although Batman briefly flees with the intention of abandoning his life as Bruce Wayne, a series of events force him to recognise the importance of his civilian life, while Cassandra determines that Cain was responsible after examination of Vesper's corpse reveals that she was first immobilised with a nerve strike Cain taught her and Bruce. Luring Cain into a confrontation near the end of the story arc, Cain concludes that Batman is indeed worthy and turns himself in to clear Wayne's name.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #605 (September 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Luthor hires [[Deadshot]] to kill Cain while he is in jail due to a fear of him implicating Luthor in Fairchild's murder. Cain has a death wish and almost allows himself to be killed before being reminded of Cassandra. He then fights back and nearly shoots Deadshot repeatedly, intentionally leaving him alive to prove a point. Cassandra visits Cain while in jail and attacks him, threatening to kill him if he ever commits another murder. Cain was proud of this and told Cassandra the date of her [[birthday]] and said that &quot;My little girl... all grown up.&quot; Later, he escaped from prison undetected to give Cassandra a birthday present before returning.

===Truth and consequences===

Cassandra recently became curious as to the identity of her birth mother, believing it to be Lady Shiva. When she visited Cain in prison, he refused to tell her. Cassandra eventually confirmed her suspicions when she met Lady Shiva herself. As a result, Cassandra also quit being the super heroine [[Batgirl]].

===One Year Later===

[[Image:Caincassandra.PNG|Cassandra shoots her father. Art by Freddie E. Williams II.|thumb]]
Following the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity jump, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] captures Cain and brings him to the [[League of Assassins]] as ransom to save Cassandra, only to find that Cassandra is their leader. Cassandra explains that she chose to join the League because she found that Cain had trained other children in addition to her.&lt;ref name=r150&gt;''Robin'' #150 (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Her actions were later explained to be the result of [[Deathstroke]] injecting her with a mind-altering serum. After her speech, Cassandra handed Robin a gun to kill David, offering him a place in her League.&lt;ref name=r150 /&gt; When he refused, she shot her father herself. Cain tells Robin that there were other girls in addition to Cassandra and Annalea before apparently dying. Afterwards, Robin and Cassandra fight. The battle ends when an explosion causes a fire to break out. By the time Robin returns to where he had left Cain's body, it is gone and the assassins' necks are broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

===Batgirl===

In the 2008 Batgirl mini-series, it is revealed that Deathstroke had given Cassandra the gun she used to shoot Cain, which was not fatal. After Tim and Cassandra started fighting, he got up and killed the ninjas himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped to open up an &quot;assassination shop&quot; with Cassandra as his second-in-command, using a drug that would turn his army into metahumans. He disappears when Cassandra murders the businessman who was providing that drug. Cain then plots with Slade to &quot;cripple the meta-hero community.&quot; Cassandra, who used listening devices to overhear, believes that Oracle is the target of this plot and races to Platinum Heights, Oracle's base of operations, to rescue her.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra locates her father on a rooftop and engages in one-on-one combat. He slides over an edge and is hanging by one hand. Cassandra contemplates whether to save him or not; when he falls, she attempts to grab him. She sees that he only fell a few feet to a ledge below, where he is arrested by Batman, who had followed Cassandra there.&lt;ref&gt;''Batgirl'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
* David Cain was alluded to in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. He was referenced in a file in the Sionis Steel Mill that had a reject stamp on it, implying that the Joker (while disguised as Black Mask) considered hiring his services to assassinate the Batman, but decided against it just like he decided against hiring [[Black Spider]] and [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]. His name is also mentioned in Lady Shiva's assassin profile in the beginning of the game alongside [[Richard Dragon]] and [[Nyssa Raatko]] as being her associates.

'''[[Admiral]]''' '''Helena Cain''' is a [[fictional character]] in the reimagined [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', portrayed by [[Michelle Forbes]].

==Character description==
===Youth===
As a 9-year-old girl on her home colony of [[Twelve Colonies|Tauron]], Helena witnessed her parents' deaths during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack in the first Cylon War. She fled with her sister, Lucy, but the younger sibling stumbled in the rubble. Too injured to continue, Lucy pleaded for help from her older sister, but Helena froze and, seeing a Cylon landing party, ran away and hid in a nearby storage container. She was discovered there by a 0005 Centurion sentry. As it targeted her, she picked up a folding knife and prepared to defend herself. Before the Centurion could strike, however, it received orders to depart, as a treaty had been signed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Razor&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Battlestar Galactica: Razor| title=Razor| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now safe, Helena returned to where she left her sister, but the younger girl was missing. Only her doll remained. Looking into the sky, she sees a Cylon ship depart. It becomes clear that her sister has been taken for what can only be presumed is further experimentation towards creating a human cylon hybrid. In the aftermath, Helena vowed to do whatever it took to survive, hence leading her to become a &quot;Razor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Razor&quot;/&gt;

===In the colonial fleet===
Cain later made a name for herself as an ambitious officer in the [[Colonial Forces (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Fleet]]. She was something of a rising star with strong political connections: Commander [[William Adama]] later remarks to President Laura Roslin that she was promoted &quot;to Rear Admiral over half the Commanders on the list&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Pegasus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cylon attack===
Prior to [[the Destruction of the Twelve Colonies|the destruction of the Twelve Colonies]], Cain's flagship, the [[Pegasus (Battlestar Galactica)|Battlestar ''Pegasus'']], was docked at the Scorpion Fleet Shipyards for a major refit. The refit team included a civilian network analyst, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Gina Inviere|Gina Inviere]], with whom Cain began a relationship. At the time of the attack, Admiral Cain, like many of her crew, was preparing to leave the ship on [[shore leave]]. The initial Cylon strike destroyed five Colonial vessels in ''Pegasus''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; immediate vicinity and severely damaged the ''Pegasus'' herself, killing 700 crew members. In a desperate gamble, Admiral Cain ordered a &quot;blind jump&quot; that took the ''Pegasus'' out of the combat zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;/&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Cain addressed her crew, promising revenge against the Cylons through a guerrilla-style war. Among her inner circle, however, she said she was not willing to foolishly risk lives in the pursuit of vengeance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Razor&quot;/&gt;

During the attack, Cain became impressed by the fortitude of her new aide, a young, impressionable officer named Kendra Shaw, and quickly took the young woman under her wing, giving her the knife she found as a child. Shaw worked with Gina to restore the Pegasus computers, and they discovered a Cylon communications relay nearby. Cain saw this as the perfect opportunity to strike back at the Cylons and ordered a surprise attack. After jumping into range of the relay, a fleet of Cylon Raiders jumped in and attacked Pegasus. Pegasus executive officer Commander Jurgen Belzen suspected that the Cylon relay was a trap and suggested a strategic retreat. Belzen's suspicions soon proved to be correct. However, Cain doubted his judgment, instead preferring to launch a full counterstrike, hoping it would catch the Cylons by surprise. This strategy did not work out at all as Cain had planned. When Belzen questioned Cain's decision and refused to carry out her foolish order to continue with the attack Cain ordered Commander Belzen to hand over his sidearm.  He reluctantly handed over his pistol, and Cain shot him in the head with it. She then appointed [[Colonel]] Jack Fisk as executive officer and ordered him to launch the attack. Shocked by Belzen's execution, Fisk immediately agreed to carry out the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Razor&quot;/&gt;

The Cylons managed to board the Pegasus during the attack, leading to the discovery of Gina as a Cylon agent. With this betrayal, heightened by her relationship with a Cylon infiltrator, Cain ordered Lt. Alastair Thorne to brutally interrogate the prisoner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Razor&quot;/&gt;

Pegasus then found 15 refugee civilian ships, but rather than protect them like [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|''Galactica'']] did, Admiral Cain unscrupulously opted to strip these civilian vessels of any useful parts and supplies, draft any civilians who had valuable technical experience into her crew, and then leave the remaining civilians aboard their ships defenseless and at the mercy of the Cylons. If any civilians refused to join the ''Pegasus'' crew, Cain ordered that their families be executed. Overall, two families were killed under her orders until the draftees relented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resurrection Ship&quot;&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resurrection Ship| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting ''Galactica''===
Six months after the Cylon holocaust, Pegasus was tracking a Cylon fleet when it accidentally encountered ''Galactica'' and her civilian ships. Taking over from Commander Adama as military commander of the fleet, Admiral Cain quickly arranges for ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s stores to be replenished from ''Pegasus''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s own, but neglects the civilian fleet, ignoring President [[Laura Roslin]]'s requests on their behalf. (This would be considered a gross offense under military protocol since Roslin is acknowledged as legal authority over the military.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;/&gt;

Cain's chief military objective became identifying a mysterious Cylon vessel sighted in the fleet pursuing ''Galactica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;/&gt; Cain gives Dr. Gaius Baltar access to Gina to continue the interrogation and learn more about the ship, identified as a [[Cylon Resurrection ship]]. The strategic value of knocking out the Cylons' means of avoiding death is not lost on the Colonial military commanders, and so ''Pegasus'' and ''Galactica'' plan a joint operation to engage the Cylon fleet and destroy the Resurrection ship.

Concurrently with this operation, Admiral Cain and Commander Adama come into conflict over the treatment of two ''Galactica'' crew members, Lt. [[Karl Agathon]] and Chief [[Galen Tyrol]]. Admiral Cain sentences the pair to death for the accidental manslaughter of a ''Pegasus'' officer. Cain and Adama come to the brink of firing on one another's vessels&lt;ref name=&quot;Pegasus&quot;/&gt; before standing down and agreeing to postpone their disagreements until the Resurrection ship has been destroyed. Nonetheless, each makes plans to have the other assassinated following the successful completion of the operation. Neither plan is carried out, much to the relief of the respective assassins: Captain [[Kara Thrace|Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]] and Colonel Fisk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Resurrection Ship&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
Unbeknownst to Cain, Baltar also once had a relationship with a Six, and still has visions of the one influencing his decisions. As he interrogated Gina, Baltar fell in love with her. After the Resurrection Ship is destroyed, Baltar tells Gina she deserves justice and helps her escape. Gina kills her guard, steals his gun, and makes her way to Cain's ready room and shoots Cain, her captor and former lover, in the head (Cain's last words being &quot;Frak You!&quot;). After her death, Cain is [[eulogy|eulogized]] by both Colonel Fisk and Captain Thrace, who says they are weaker without her.

Callisto appears in the 2006 film, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', where she is played by actress [[Dania Ramirez]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=November 2013}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #169 ([[1983 in comics#May|May 1983]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Callisto's origins are unknown, although she claims that the scars she bears are proof of &quot;how dumb a mistake&quot; it was for her to try to live among normal humans; in one of her earlier appearances, her greatest psychological fear is the image of the beautiful woman that she once was.

===Morlocks===
Callisto takes up residence in an abandoned [[Cold War]]-era bomb shelter hidden within the sewers. Under untold circumstances, she meets [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a mutant whose power is to sense the presence of other mutants. She decides to make the bomb shelter a sanctuary for mutants like herself, using Caliban's power to track down such mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #170&lt;/ref&gt; She calls this newly formed society the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], after the group of futuristic subterraneans in &quot;the Time Machine&quot; by H.G. Wells.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #169&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto kidnaps [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], intending to make him her mate. [[Kitty Pryde]] is struck with a deadly illness in an attempt to rescue him, and Callisto refuses to allow her companions to take her to the surface for medical treatment. To rescue Kitty, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] challenges and beats Callisto in a duel for the leadership of the Morlocks.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #169-170&lt;/ref&gt; As the new leader of the Morlocks, Storm decrees that they would no longer kidnap and terrorize surface-dwellers, and in return they would have peace. The confrontation between Callisto and Storm leaves both parties consumed with hatred for each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:uxm170.jpg|left|Cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #170. Art by Paul Smith.|thumb]]
Callisto attempts to take revenge on Storm by manipulating Kitty Pryde into marrying Caliban, but is foiled when Caliban releases Kitty from their betrothal.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #179&lt;/ref&gt; When the wizard [[Kulan Gath]] enslaves and [[wikt:ensorcell|ensorcell]]s the city of [[New York City|New York]] and transforms it into a [[Hyborian Age]] city, Callisto becomes his warrior servant. She battles Storm again, but Storm saves her life. Callisto helps defeat Kulan Gath, and as a result Callisto and her allies find themselves on a new timeline where Kulan Gath never transformed New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #190-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, Callisto becomes more of an ally to the X-Men. She rescues [[Professor X]] after he was nearly killed by an anti-mutant mob.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #193&lt;/ref&gt; She saves [[Power Pack]] from the Morlocks [[Annalee (comics)|Annalee]] and Masque.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #195&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto is wounded during the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]' [[Mutant Massacre|massacre of the Morlocks]], and takes refuge with the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #211&lt;/ref&gt; She convinces Storm not to give up leadership of the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #212&lt;/ref&gt;

After a while, Callisto moves to [[Muir Island]] to become the bodyguard for [[Moira MacTaggert]]. With Moira, she is transported to an alternate Earth where Britain is dominated by Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Nazi counterparts of Callisto and Moira appear on the [[Earth-616|mainstream Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; These counterparts capture Brigadier [[Alistaire Stuart]] at the Tower of London,&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; but fail in their attempt to escape the Tower of London.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Both Callisto and Moira and their counterparts then return to their native Earths.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Being beautiful===
Callisto later encounters an [[amnesia]]c [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who has assumed the identity of artist Peter Nicholas. Peter remembers nothing of his former life after his journey through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. The two become attracted to each other after [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], who had taken control of the Morlocks in Callisto's absence, restores Callisto's beauty to greater than it was, only to take it away later as a means of tormenting her.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #259-260&lt;/ref&gt; The process is repeated several times before Callisto and Colossus are rescued by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Jean Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #262&lt;/ref&gt;

Callisto began a career as a fashion model and moved above ground, embarking on a new life with Peter Nicholas as her lover. They were attacked by [[Genosha]]n magistrates but defeated them.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #264&lt;/ref&gt; The Morlocks later attacked Callisto, still under the influence of Masque. Masque had grossly transformed the Morlocks, leaving them with grotesque physical mutations. They nearly beat Callisto to death. The Morlocks' [[Healer (comics)|Healer]] treated her wounds, but accidentally restored Callisto's scars and her original physical deformities. The Healer's powers were overloaded by the severity of her injuries, killing him in the process.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Callisto vowed revenge on her former followers for stealing away her looks, and then allied herself with [[Mikhail Rasputin]], Colossus' older brother. Mikhail and Callisto appeared to have perished when he used his powers over matter to flood the Morlock tunnels. Rasputin had actually transported the Morlocks into an alternate reality, where time moved more quickly than on Earth. There she watched as the Morlock youths grew up with great bitterness towards their elders for all that had happened to them.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

When the young Morlocks, now calling themselves [[Gene Nation]], returned to Earth with revenge planned, she went looking for help and located her former love Colossus, who had recently returned to Earth after the fall of Avalon. The two returned to the X-Mansion to warn the X-Men that Gene Nation was planning to kill innocents for every Morlock killed during the Mutant Massacre. Drawing Storm and Wolverine into the tunnels, she witnessed as Storm fought [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] in a duel that saw the X-Man once more resort to lethal measures to win.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Callisto remained in the tunnels looking over Marrow until she became injured during the events of [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. Recovering from her wounds, she told Marrow to find a place amongst the X-Men, figuring it to be the best place for her. Callisto also has a [[maternal]] relationship with Marrow, acting as a mother-figure towards the young mutant, though the two are not biologically related, making her the only person Marrow would follow nearly blindly.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} After the six-month gap and Marrow's departure from the X-Men, Callisto disappeared.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Later, Callisto was once again transformed by Masque, having her arms reformed into tentacles. Callisto was also under Masque's control in &quot;The Arena,&quot; an elite fight club in [[Japan]]. Callisto and Storm battled each other in the Arena, but later both escaped with help from Storm's friend, [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===Genoshan Excalibur===
She was one of the main characters in the 2004 ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' title, where she was helping [[Professor X]]avier and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] rebuild [[Genosha]]. Ironically, this alliance briefly (and perhaps uncomfortably) reunited her with Archangel.&lt;ref&gt;''Excalibur'' #12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Son of M===
In the aftermath of [[House of M]], Callisto is among the many mutants to have lost her powers. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] offered to her the [[Terrigen Mist]]s, stolen from the [[Inhumans]], as a way to restore her powers. Callisto willingly accepted the offer and the Mist effectively restored all her previous abilities (minus her disfigurements and arm-tentacles), but without any control over them. Her new senses are so acute that even a drop of rain causes her tremendous pain; unable to handle it, she fell into a coma. The depowered [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] found her body and showed it to Quicksilver saying that he poisoned her with the Terrigen Mist. He later took her body to a hospital, where the effects of the Mists wore off.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===X-Cell===
Callisto was later reunited with Marrow as members of [[X-Cell]], a group of mutants who hold the government responsible for their power loss. When Quicksilver offered to repower its members, she warned [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] about what happens to non-Inhumans who gain power from the Terrigen Mist. She and Marrow later fled into the sewers to escape the government.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===Return to the sewers===
At some point, Callisto returned to the sewers, this time alone. However, she is later discovered by various teen and young adult runaways, who she begins to care for, though with a firm but caring hand. Storm later stumbles upon this group while investigating one of the young girl's disappearance. Storm and Callisto let old feelings surface and the two fight. However, when Storm sees the girl helping Callisto, she realizes that the girl is there by choice and the hostilities cease. Storm helps them clean up. Before leaving, Storm offers Callisto to send regular help should they need it.&lt;ref&gt;''Storm'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Callisto possesses enhanced senses of sight (including night vision), hearing, smell, taste, and touch, and possibly moderate degrees of enhanced strength and agility. It has also been suggested&lt;ref&gt;''X-Treme X-Men'' #38&lt;/ref&gt; that her mutant power grants her tactical brilliance that allows her to see the best way to engage in any given conflict. Callisto lost her mutant powers after the House of M;{{Issue|date=October 2009}} her powers were restored temporarily through use of the Terrigen Mist, although her senses were enhanced to a point where normal sensations became painful.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Callisto also has excellent hand-to-hand combat skills, and is an exceptional hunter and tracker. She is usually armed with knives.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, Callisto is neither a follower of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] nor an enemy of his regime. She's the leader of a band of [[Piracy|pirates]] that attack the few vessels that venture through the Infernal Gallop to [[Savage Land|Avalon]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Calibre'' #2 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; She captures the submarine Excalibur and kills all of its passengers except for [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and ends up being killed by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Calibre'' #2-3 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross Time Capers===
Another version of Callisto is seen when [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] confronts inadvertent visitors of a world dominated by Nazis. She is the bodyguard of [[Moira MacTaggert]]. These Nazis unintentionally send Excalibur on a long adventure known as the Cross-Time Caper.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]] reality, Callisto is the leader of the Marauders, a black ops team.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

===Mutant X===
In the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, she still leads the Morlocks, but is much more weak-willed and pacifist in nature. She is the lover of [[Mole Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mutant X'' #9 (June 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Callisto is introduced in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #82 as a member of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' # 82&lt;/ref&gt; Her look has remained virtually unchanged, and she has the mutant ability to sprout a mass of tentacles from her eye which is covered by an eye-patch. It is also apparent that she has no control over herself when the tentacles come out as Caliban had to knock her out to keep her from killing [[Jean Grey]] during a fight with the [[X-Men]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' # 83&lt;/ref&gt;
===X-Men Evolution===
In the comic based on the show Callisto appears as the leader of the Morlocks.{{issue|date=April 2016}}

==In other media==

===Television===
* Callisto appeared in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]''. She and the other Morlocks captured Cyclops and Jean Grey rather than Angel. In the Spanish-dubbed version of the show, Callisto is portrayed as a male character in the two-part episode ''Out of the Past''. In the other episodes involving the Morlocks, Callisto is correctly voiced by a female Spanish actress.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* Callisto also appears in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' voiced by [[Saffron Henderson]]. She is depicted as a less-violent, more even-tempered leader of the Morlocks. She first appeared to sabotage a beverage company when its beverage Pow-R-8 (AKA Power Eight) leaks into the sewers and is revealed to be poisonous to the mutants. She later returned in &quot;Uprising&quot; when anti-mutant thugs were using laser technology to attack the X-Men, [[Spyke]], and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. In contrast to her original personality, this Callisto is a voice of reason with Spyke being the more violent-minded vigilante.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Film===
* [[Dania Ramirez]] portrays Callisto in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. In the film version, Callisto is a mutant speedster who has the secondary ability to sense the powers and locations of other mutants, a power that, in the comics, belongs to her teammate [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]. She was the leader of The Omegas and then joins forces with Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. In place of an [[eyepatch]] and scars, this version of Callisto is heavily tattooed and has many piercings, and she seems to harbor a dislike towards Storm. She was electrocuted against the fence by Storm after their climactic battle on [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]].

===Novelization===
* According to the book adaptation of ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', she was the leader of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], an all-mutant gang before joining Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. According to a novelty card game, Callisto is said to have been born in the [[Dominican Republic]] and emigrated to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], in [[New York City]] as an infant where she honed her skills as a fighter and tracker. In the book she does not possess superhuman speed. The novel confirms that Storm kills her in the final battle.

'''George''' &quot;'''Digger'''&quot; '''Harkness''', best known under his alias '''Captain Boomerang''' or just '''Boomerang''', is a fictional  [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] and an antihero, who appears in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He is an [[enemy]] of both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Wally West]], who each hold the heroic mantle of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. After Harkness is killed during the 2004 storyline &quot;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&quot;, his son, Owen Mercer (also known as Owen Harkness), takes over his father's mantle for a period of time until his death. Following the 2009–2010 &quot;[[Blackest Night]]&quot; storyline, Harkness returns to life and returns as Captain Boomerang.

The George &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness incarnation of Captain Boomerang was portrayed by [[Jai Courtney]] in the 2016 ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' film.

==Publication history==
Digger Harkness first appears in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' and was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]. Throughout the first several years of the character's existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with an American accent. Beginning in the late 1980s he developed an Australian accent.

Owen Mercer first appeared in ''Identity Crisis'' #2 (2004) and was created by [[Brad Meltzer]] and [[Rags Morales]]

==Fictional character biographies==
===George Harkness===
[[File:The Flash, vol. 1, no. 117.jpg|200px|left|thumb|George Harkness's debut as Captain Boomerang on the cover of ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #117 (Dec. 1960).]]
Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an Australian woman, Harkness was raised in an Australian town called [[Korumburra]] in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making [[boomerang]]s, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. It was at this time that he developed the Captain Boomerang persona that he would continue to use in his later criminal career.  Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.  As he began committing crimes he threw suspicion off of himself by briefly pretending another man was impersonating him, showing his 'parents', (really other crooks) to the Flash after the Flash caught him next to a crime scene. He nearly succeeded in killing the Flash after knocking him out with a boomerang, then tying him to a giant boomerang that he fired, which then got sent into space and then fell into the ocean.  However, the Flash was able to escape from his friction-proof bonds by quickly vibrating his molecules.  He also increased the boomerang's velocity so much he was able to use it to defeat and jail Harkness and the two crooks.

He became a recurring enemy of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects (some would explode, others had razor-sharp edges, etc.), and using them ruthlessly. He became a staple member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash, and who were first organized after [[Gorilla Grodd]] broke them out of jail. Though captured when Flash made their weapons hit each other, they continued to act together.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link = Robert Greenberger|contribution = Captain Boomerang|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 66|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = New York|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, Harkness became a less-than-effective member of the [[Suicide Squad]] in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; However, Captain Boomerang's grating personality and blatant racism (among other things, he constantly referred to black team member [[Bronze Tiger]] as an &quot;abbo&quot;) caused considerable friction among his teammates, and he was considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member of the team—dysfunctional even by the Squad's standards and the equivalent of a [[class clown]].

[[Amanda Waller]], the Squad's commanding officer, characterized Captain Boomerang as &quot;a jerk and a screw-up.&quot; This was not an undeserved reputation, as, among other things, Harkness simply watched as his teammate [[Mindboggler]] was shot in the back, even while he could have easily saved her. (Mindboggler had earlier used her mind-manipulating abilities on Harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member.) He also manipulated another team member, [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]], into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the Squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape. (Unfortunately for Slipknot, they did). He was scared to learn Ifrit, an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the Jihad, had been created based upon Mindboggler's thought patterns, and revealed what had happened.

While in the Squad, Harkness also briefly took up the mantle of [[Mirror Master]] to commit robberies.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; However, this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to Waller, who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between Mirror Master and Captain Boomerang. She rescinded the benefits Harkness had been given such as his apartment in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and his status as a voluntary member of the Squad.

Many times Digger would have to be tricked into battle, but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight. Harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad, convincingly managing to be other slimy, criminal types. Later, Digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement, hitting various members of the Squad with pies. For a time, suspicion had been diverted from him because had used his skills to pie himself, seemingly being hit by the 'assailant' from behind a wall. When the Squad confronted Digger as the culprit, he lost his temper and shouted that they could not really punish him since he was already in prison and in the Suicide Squad. He asked Waller, &quot;What are you going to do about it, Fat Lady?!&quot; Waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island.

Due to various events, mainly Waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down, the Squad broke up for a year. When Waller was approached again because she was needed, she reformed the team and had Digger picked up. He was, at the time, trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him back to the mainland.

Harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of Australia, though his countrymen do not care at all for him, and a tremendous fear of being laughed at. Teammate Deadshot commented he often wished he had killed Harkness, most notably after his drinking led them to miss a plane and to Deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it. Ironically, when Boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to Deadshot, Lawton's psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it. Harkness remained with the Squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in Diabloverde.

However, despite being a somewhat trusted employee, Harkness still was quite amoral and greedy, selling out Adam Cray, the Atom, for half a million dollars.

Digger later showed up in ''Superboy'' with another Squad. While on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout, he was shot through the hands by Deadshot and apparently fell to his death.

He later appeared in the pages of ''Flash'' with cybernetic hands. Alongside four other Rogues, given a chance by fellow Rogue [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] to become much more than they ever were. Unfortunately for Captain Boomerang, [[Captain Cold]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], Kadabra's promise of glory was actually a ruse to free [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] and empower himself. Neron then resurrects the five Rogues, superpowering them and sending them on a bloody rampage that destroys much of Flash's hometown and kills thousands. Eventually, the Flash and [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] free the Rogues; the dead are restored to life.

After being restored to life, Boomerang and the Rogues, along with the [[Trickster (comics)#James Jesse|Trickster]], sought out an artifact that would protect them from Neron should he ever take an interest in them again. The Trickster accompanied them to help an old ex-girlfriend recover her kidnapped son. In the end, the Trickster found the boy, who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god, but also the Trickster's son. He was also able to convince Neron to leave the Rogues alone, with the Rogues either coming away darker from their experiences, or seeking enlightenment, like Heat Wave, who retired with the monks.

Captain Boomerang is also involved with the [[Joker: Last Laugh]] event. After having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs, Digger is transferred by ambulance to Keystone City. En route, the ambulance is attacked by a Jokerized [[Deadshot]], who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with Joker's serum. The serum's healing factor revives Digger, who is cured of his massive full-body burns and ready to attack the Flash at [[Iron Heights]] prison. However, once there, he is choked unconscious by a Jokerized [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].

Captain Boomerang was killed in the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries by [[Jack Drake]], father of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]. Digger had been sent by the [[Jean Loring|real killer]] to attack Jack Drake, only the killer double-crossed Digger and sent Drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself. The killer later defended the action by saying that Boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that Jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe. Digger managed to kill Drake but not before he was shot himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Identity Crisis'' #5 (December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Digger was later temporarily revived by Agent James Jesse, the former [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], during the &quot;[[Rogue War]]&quot; storyline, when Jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive Boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the Rogues' current hideout. However, Jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the Rogues before Harkness's revival, meaning that the only person present when Harkness was briefly reanimated was Ashley Zolomon, the estranged wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]] (a former [[Reverse-Flash]]), who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with Rogues. During his brief return to life, Harkness asked Ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother's real name out of fear that the Rogues would kill him.

In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, his remains are reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], and he joins the reanimated Jack and Janet Drake, John and Mary Grayson, [[Tony Zucco]], and the original Batman's deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. They are met with interference from [[Deadman]], who had possessed the body of the demon [[Etrigan]]. Their attack is ultimately called off when Batman and Red Robin cryogenically freeze themselves, leaving no emotions for the Black Lanterns to target.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Harkness later joins other reanimated members of the Rogues to target their still-living members.&lt;ref name=bntf1&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the battle results a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] on both side. Harkness' son, Owen, arrives and takes him away from the battle, believing he can bring his father back.&lt;ref name=bntf2&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Digger convinces his son that he needs to feed upon the living in order to live so Owen lures people (such as newcomer villain Sandblast) to a pit at a construction site where Digger is waiting. The Rogues track Owen down, Captain Cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe Digger's lies. When they discover the remains of a family nearby, Captain Cold reminds Owen that &quot;the Rogues don't kill women or children.&quot; He shoves Owen into the pit where Digger rips out his son's heart. A black ring then flies down to make Owen a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Harkness and his son are then encased in ice by Captain Cold.&lt;ref name=bntf3&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and rejuvenated. He appears confused as to what is going on before being knocked out by the Flash.&lt;ref name=bn8&gt;''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' prologue, Digger is seen locked in his [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]] cell.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Digger is visited by [[Tim Drake]] whose father Harkness murdered.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Robin'' #15 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Tim tells him if he tries to escape, he will hunt him down personally.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Robin'' #16 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He is later given a message from Captain Cold saying that if he wants to be one of the Rogues again, he has to prove it by escaping from prison on his own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After being beaten by guards, Digger is being seen to in the medical bay when he suddenly finds himself able to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact. While not understanding where this new power came from, Digger uses it to escape Iron Heights and attacks the Renegades while they are trying to apprehend the Flash for murdering Mirror Monarch. Shortly after, he finds himself confronting a wounded Flash.&lt;ref name=&quot;tf3&quot;&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #3 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Boomerang is at one point contacted by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]], who instructs him to throw a boomerang at [[Hawk and Dove|Dawn Granger]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the vision his powers go out of control, causing him to attack everyone, including his fellow Rogues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #5 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards Captain Boomerang sneaks into Iron Heights, where Professor Zoom is locked up. Boomerang released him, in hopes that he might help him better understand his version of the Entity's message. However, Professor Zoom refused to answer and escaped as Digger was confronted by the Rogues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #7 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Cold beats up Digger for freeing Professor Zoom, Digger explains to him an importance from the Entity's message.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Captain Boomerang is contacted once again by the Entity who tells him that he must complete his task, prompting Digger to travel to [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] forest who by now is surrounded by a white barrier. While there Captain Boomerang discovers that he's the only one who can enter the forest.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the forest, Captain Boomerang finds Dawn and throws a boomerang at her. [[Hank Hall|Hawk]]; however, fails to catch the boomerang and instead the boomerang is caught by Deadman, who ended up dying in the process and Hawk is left to knock Captain Boomerang unconscious. After the Entity proclaims Captain Boomerang has completed his task, and his life is restored to him, the Entity reveals to them that the boomerang was a part a plan to free Hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos: his act of saving Dawn would have broken hold the Lords of Chaos have on Hawk and allow Hank to be true to himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Captain Boomerang lost his White Lantern abilities. However, he seeks out a way to regain this lost power, he eventually steals the plausible deniability in Gotham City, but he is prevented by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], who is stalking him. During the struggle, Red Robin, who had lost his father due to Captain Boomerang, allows him to live and leave him in the police custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;rr26&quot;&gt;''Red Robin'' #26 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

George Harkness returns as Captain Boomerang in [[The New 52]], a reboot of the DC Comics universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #27 (March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Boomerang and a new character called Yo-Yo join the Suicide Squad to replace the deceased members Savant and Voltaic. He tells the team that he is the new field commander for the Suicide Squad upon being placed in that position by Amanda Waller.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #3 (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; But this is further revealed to be a set up orchestrated to give them a bargaining chip for bypass an armed Basilisk militia led by the sister of one of his victims. Realizing the trap, Boomerang attempts to use a detonator he was given that is supposed to be connected to the microbombs in each squad member's skin. It fails to function, and Deadshot mocks him for thinking that Waller would trust him with that kind of power before shooting his hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' (vol. 4) #4 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
It's later revealed in the series that Captain Boomerang is working for Basilisk as the Suicide Squad is captured. Captain Boomerang is seen escorting the squad to the concentration camps of the Basilisk militia. Captain Boomerang frees Deadshot and the rest of the squad and reveals that he was Waller's undercover agent. While battling the militia, Captain Boomerang is knocked out by Black Spider who is revealed as the traitor on the team.

At the beginning of the 2004 &quot;[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]&quot; storyline, &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness aka Captain Boomerang found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised, '''Owen Mercer'''. Before Harkness's death, the two bonded. Taking up his father's legacy, he became the second Captain Boomerang. [[Captain Cold]], brother to [[Golden Glider]] (who was believed to be Owen's mother), took Owen in as one of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Though Owen initially had no real attachment to the Rogues (and even voiced various, albeit short, opinions out loud), he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father's body had been stolen for use in a lab (which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from Harkness).

Around this time the &quot;Rogue War&quot; storyline began, in which the &quot;reformed&quot; Rogues fought the Rogues under Captain Cold. Ashley Zolomon is told by Harkness himself (he's briefly revived by the &quot;reformed&quot; Rogues as part of an experiment) that Golden Glider is not Owen's real mother. Later, it is revealed in Flash #225 (January 2006) that [[Meloni Thawne]] is the mother of Owen Harkness, formerly Owen Mercer, the new Captain Boomerang, having conceived him by the original Boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th Century. It is unknown whether she gave birth to Bart Allen or Owen first, or how Owen made it back to our own time.

During the 2005–2006 &quot;[[Infinite Crisis]]&quot; storyline, Owen was part of [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains#3rd Formation|group of villains]]. He, Captain Cold, and [[Mirror Master]] were sent to guard a factory against the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], under the command of [[Deathstroke]] (who was actually [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] in disguise). When the ensuing battle between Outsiders and Rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory, the Rogues and other villains wouldn't help in the fight at all and then at the explosion, he is saved by the Outsiders, while the Rogues left them at the base to blow up. He is then turned over to the authorities off-panel.

During the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, Owen is part of a [[Suicide Squad]] sent by [[Amanda Waller]] to attack [[Black Adam]].

In the 2006 &quot;[[One Year Later]]&quot; storyline, Owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as [[Iron Heights]]. There he finds himself being the cellmate of [[Black Lightning]], who was arrested for a murder that Deathstroke the Terminator committed.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; It is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of Black Lightning's identity and are planning to murder him. The Outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break Pierce out of jail. Unfortunately it goes terribly wrong. As they escape, Black Lightning asks that they take Owen with them, which they grudgingly agree. As they escape, the Outsiders' jet, the ''Pequod'', is shot down, and while the team escapes, the world believes them dead.

Because of this event and the Freedom of Power Treaty, the team now works covertly. Most of the current Outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world. His history as a Rogue has been exploited several times by team leader [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]. However, it is revealed that his desire to join the Outsiders comes from his desire for a family. Nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because Arsenal felt he would be worthy, and because Owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the Rogue War.

Owen searched out the current [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] because of their connection, where their fathers killed one another. While Robin originally believed Owen was searching for him in order to finish the fight his father started, in ''Robin'' #152, Owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero, and has offered his assistance to help Robin destroy a bomb created by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]. The two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains. Afterward, Robin gained a bit of civil respect for Boomerang despite what their fathers did to another. Boomerang attempted to shake hands with Robin, but Robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step.

At some point during his tenure with the Outsiders, Captain Cold approached the mercenary [[Deathstroke]] with an offer concerning Owen. In exchange for kidnapping Deathstroke's daughter [[Rose Wilson|Rose]] (who had betrayed her father and joined the [[Teen Titans]]) and delivering her to her father, Deathstroke would track down the Outsiders and turn Owen over to the Rogues. The villains planned to force Owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind-controlling agent that Deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as Batman's partner [[Cassandra Cain]]. However, this plan fell apart when Rose escaped and helped the Teen Titans defeat the Rogues, which led to Deathstroke backing out of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans: Cold Case'' (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen has also developed a close friendship with Supergirl, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; After Supergirl returned from her time away with Power Girl, Kara began looking to start a normal life on Earth and went out a 'date' with Owen, during which they spoke of their past problems. Kara has nicknamed Owen 'Boomer'. Although the pair often flirts with one another, they have never progressed to a romantic relationship. This comes primarily from the fact that Kara continues to show interest in Nightwing, and jokingly says that what she and Owen has is more of a brother-sister relationship, in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his 'little sis'.

Feeling rejected after Kara's relationship with [[Power Boy]], Owen goes to a bar where he meets [[Cassandra Cain]] (Batgirl), who at the time was being mind controlled by Deathstroke the Terminator, and who has been hired to kill Supergirl. Cassandra kidnaps and tortures Owen to lure Supergirl. Unfortunately, this proves unnecessary, as Kara had tracked down Cassandra on her own, without any knowledge of Owen's kidnapping. Batgirl nearly manages to defeat Supergirl, but is defeated when Kara grows Krypton Sunstones which impale her foe. Kara then rushes Owen to the hospital where he is treated. While still in medical care, it is discovered that Power Boy has been stalking Kara.

Following Kara's rather violent break-up with Power Boy, the earth was overtaken by spirits from the Phantom Zone, which began to emerge from within Superman. Kara managed to defeat the Phantoms and return the Earth to normal. Afterwards, in Supergirl #19 Kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth. Amongst them, Boomer, who she apologies for letting him get hurt and leading him on. During this conversation, the matter of Owen's relationship with Kara is finally clarified. When asked by Kara how he feels about her leading him on, Owen replies, &quot;Well, if I may ... for me to have been 'led on' would presume I thought I had a shot with you ... For me to think I had a shot with a sixteen-year-old girl -- crystal-powered hypersleep whatever junk aside ... that would mean I am a dirtbag with a thing for jailbait. Which I am not.&quot;

In ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #13-15, crossover with ''Outsiders'' #47-49, Checkmate abducts all members of the Outsiders except [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], allowing him to infiltrate their headquarters offer them a deal: The Outsiders won't be shut down over their actions in Africa in exchange for infiltrating Oolong Island on behalf of Checkmate. During the operation, Nightwing, Owen, and Checkmate's [[Sasha Bordeaux|Black Queen]] are taken captive by [[Chang Tzu]], and the latter two are tortured and experimented on. After [[Batman]] rescues the Outsiders over [[North Korea]]n territory, and Nightwing hands over the team to him, Owen and Nightwing are paired with each other in &quot;auditions&quot; for the new line up. Pushed too far, feeling he doesn't need to prove himself anymore, Owen returns to the Suicide Squad although Batman feels he could make a good [[double agent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

In ''All Flash'' #1, Owen as part of the new Suicide Squad captures two of the Rogues that are responsible for Bart Allen's murder, [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Weather Wizard]], in Louisiana. In ''Countdown'' #39, he and the rest of the squad chase after [[Pied Piper (comics)|Piper]] and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] in [[Gotham City]] after they had escaped capture from Squad member [[Deadshot]]. The Squad however, is just as unsuccessful as Deadshot, and the two Rogues escape capture.

Owen visits his father's grave along with [[Tar Pit (comics)|Tar Pit]], when the swarm of [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black rings]] fly into the crypt and reanimate all the deceased villains as [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]], including his father.&lt;ref name=bntf1 /&gt; The Rogues battle in the [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]], when the battle resulted a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] on both sides and Harkness's son, Owen, arrives and took him away from the battle, believing he can bring his father back.&lt;ref name=bntf2 /&gt; Later on, Owen has apparently chained up his father's body and is feeding him victims such as a villain named Sandblast who was relying on Owen to get him into the Rogues. It is revealed that Owen has been deceived by Boomerang into believing the blood of enough victims can bring him back to life. The Rogues track Owen down with Captain Cold berating him on believing Harkness' lies. Realizing that Owen has broken the Rogues' code of honor by killing women and children, Cold shoves him into the pit. Owen has his heart ripped out by his father, with a ring flying in to revive him as a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Owen and his father are then encased in ice by Cold.&lt;ref name=bntf3 /&gt; His father manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and full health.&lt;ref name=bn8 /&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Boomerang carries a number of boomerangs in his satchel. He is an expert at throwing the weapons and as well as ordinary boomerangs he has a number with special properties, including bladed, explosive, incendiary, and electrified boomerangs. Upon his resurrection, Digger finds he has the ability to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact.&lt;ref name=&quot;tf3&quot;/&gt; However this new ability is lost when he completes the task given by the White Lantern Entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;rr26&quot;/&gt;

The original Captain Boomerang then began to train his son Owen Mercer before he died. He has exhibited creativity in his boomerangs by creating &quot;razorangs&quot; and an acid-spewing boomerang. Owen has also exhibited &quot;speed bursts&quot;: short burst of limited super speed over short distances, most notably when throwing boomerangs. These were even possible during the time period that Bart Allen fully contained the [[Speed Force]], usually displayed as his ability to throw boomerangs at high velocities, rather than running.&lt;ref&gt;''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #36 (July 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, during [[Chang Tzu]]'s experiments he claimed he believed Mercer could access the Speed Force, and Mercer denied having super speed at all anymore, but Chang Tzu was able to activate Owen's speed involuntarily, causing him great pain.&lt;ref&gt;''Checkmate'' (vol. 2) #15 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The exact source of this power remains unrevealed. Regardless, as of ''Justice Society of America'' #8, the Speed Force appears to have returned and is accessible to all former speedsters once more.

==Publication history==
Created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #8 (June 1957).

==Fictional character biography==
Leonard Snart was raised by an abusive father and took refuge with his grandfather, who worked in an ice truck. When his grandfather died, Snart grew tired of his father's abuse and set out to start a criminal career. Snart joined up with a group of small-time thieves and in planning out a robbery, each was issued a gun and a visor to protect their eyes against the flashes of gunfire. This visor design would later be adapted by Snart into his trademark costume. In recent years he has added a radio receiver to them which picks up the police band to monitor local law enforcement. Snart and the other thugs were captured by the Flash and imprisoned. Snart decided to go solo, but knew he had to do something about the local hero, the Flash.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Snart read an article that theorized that the energy emissions of a [[cyclotron]] could interfere with the Flash's speed. He designed a weapon to harness that power and broke into a cyclotron lab, intending to use the device to charge up his experimental gun. As he was finishing his experiment, a security guard surprised Snart. Intending to use his gun only to scare the guard, he inadvertently pulled the trigger and discovered that his weapon had been altered in a way he had never imagined. The moisture in the air around the guard froze. Intrigued by this twist of fate, Snart donned a [[Anorak|parka]] and the aforementioned visor and declared himself to be Captain Cold - the man who mastered absolute zero. Snart then committed a series of non-lethal crimes, on one occasion placing the city in suspended animation in an attempt to force Iris West to marry him as he had fallen in love with her when he saw her in the prison, but the Flash got through a wall of ice and was able to reverse the process. He later fell in love with a newscaster, and competed with [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] (in his first appearance) over her in a crime spree, but they were both beaten by the Flash. But after Barry Allen's death, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Captain Cold became a [[bounty hunter]] with his sister Lisa, the [[Golden Glider]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

During the events of ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', Captain Cold lost his soul to [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] but Wally West brought it back to the land of the living. He soon returned to crime, this time a member of Wally's Rogues Gallery. The Rogues had first been assembled when another Flash foe, the super-intelligent [[Gorilla Grodd]] had broken them out of jail to distract the Flash. The Golden Glider had abandoned her bounty hunter career and had started partnering with a series of thugs who she dressed in a costume, armed with a copy of Captain Cold's signature Cold Gun, and called [[Chillblaine]]. Already distraught over the death of her lover, the [[Top (comics)|Top]], it seemed that the supposed death of her brother pushed her over the edge. But the last Chillblaine was a little smarter and more vicious. He murdered the Golden Glider, prompting Captain Cold to hunt him down, torture him and kill him by freezing his outer layer of skin and then pushing him off a high rise building. Not long after that, Snart was framed by a new incarnation of [[Mister Element]]. He used his Element Gun to simulate Cold's gun, using ice and cold to murder several police officers before Captain Cold and the Flash discovered who was actually responsible. With the death of his sister, and having killed Chillblaine and Mr. Element in vengeance, Cold has again become an unrepentant criminal. However, during a confrontation with [[Brother Grimm]], Cold actually worked with Wally West to defeat the powerful magic user, although this was mainly because he and [[Mirror Master]] had been betrayed by Grimm and wanted revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Captain Cold was declared the leader of the Flash's Rogue's Gallery. His skill and experience have made him a strong leader to the likes of the [[Weather Wizard]], the new [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], the new [[Mirror Master]], and the [[Owen Mercer|new Captain Boomerang]]. Len seems to have taken the young Captain Boomerang under his wing, after the elder Boomerang was recently killed. Tabloids rumoured that Captain Cold's sister, the Golden Glider, was Boomerang's mother, making him Captain Cold's nephew. This turned out to be false, however, as the new Boomerang's mother has been revealed to be [[Meloni Thawne]], who is also the mother of [[Bart Allen]]. Despite his more ruthless nature as of late, Captain Cold's heart is not completely frozen, evidenced by having sent flowers to honor [[Sue Dibny]], murdered wife of the [[Elongated Man]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

Traditionally, Captain Cold is driven by three things: money, women, and the desire to beat Barry Allen. Although not the lech that Captain Boomerang was, Len Snart has an eye for the ladies, particularly models. When Barry Allen died, Captain Cold drifted for a while, jumping back and forth over the lines of crime and justice. He was captured by the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] and served time in the [[Suicide Squad]], worked with his sister as a bounty hunter (Golden Snowball Recoveries), and, with his longtime friend and sometimes nemesis [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], encountered [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] of the [[Justice League]]. He has teamed up with various villains over the years other than the many Rogues. These include [[Catwoman]] and the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. His favorite baseball team is the [[Houston Astros]].{{issue|date=November 2013}}

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
In the 2006 &quot;[[One Year Later]]&quot; storyline, he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash (then [[Bart Allen]]). Though Inertia was defeated, Captain Cold, Weather Wizard, Heat Wave, Mirror Master and Abra Kadabra killed Bart with a combined barrage of their elemental weapons. He, Heat Wave, and Weather Wizard seemed to express guilt, however, after learning the identity of the Flash and how young he was.

===''Salvation Run''===
Captain Cold is one of the exiled villains featured in the 2007-08 miniseries ''[[Salvation Run]]'' along with his fellow Rogues: [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]], and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]].

===''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge''===
In the 2008 miniseries ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'', Captain Cold and the Rogues briefly joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' story, however, Cold and the rest of the Rogues reject Libra's offer, wanting to stay out of the game. Before they can retire, they hear of Inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Cold and his group is challenged by a new set of Rogues, formed by Libra to be their replacements. The new group, having kidnapped Cold's father, challenge the Rogues, and are defeated and killed. Cold goes to his father, talking to him about the abuse he suffered, and the fate of his sister. After the elder Snart insults him and his mother, calling them weak, Cold punches him, but finds himself unable to kill him, instead getting Heat Wave to do it.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; The Rogues have their confrontation with Inertia, despite interference by Zoom and Libra, and kill Inertia. Libra then reveals that he needs the Rogues because Barry Allen has returned from the dead, and the Flashes are potential threats to him and Darkseid. Though shocked by the news that Allen is alive, Cold still rejects his offer of membership. After regrouping, Cold and the other Rogues agree not to retire, claiming that the game is back on.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, someone that looks like Captain Cold appears as a [[Justifiers|Justifier]] and is seen fighting the Female Furies alongside the other Justifiers under Lex Luthor's control.

===''The Flash: Rebirth''===
In the 2009 ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' miniseries, Captain Cold is seen with the other Rogues, reading about Barry Allen's return and claiming that they would need more of the Rogues.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Rogues are still debating Allen's return, with Cold saying it's time to pull out their contingency plan that [[Mirror Master|Scudder]] came up with, stating ''&quot;In case The Flash returns, break glass.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
In the 2009–2010 &quot;[[Blackest Night]]&quot; storyline, the Rogues realize that the bodies of various dead Rogues are missing and prepare to fight them. Captain Cold knows that his sister, the Golden Glider, is among the reanimated [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] but is still ready to lead the Rogues against the zombies.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #1 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He is confronted by the Black Lantern Glider, who attempts to use his feelings of love for her against him. However, Captain Cold manages to suppress these feelings long enough for him to fight back, freezing her within a block of ice.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently kills Owen Mercer by throwing him into a pit with his Black Lantern father when he learns that Owen has been feeding people to his father in the belief that consuming flesh will restore him to life, informing Owen that Rogues do not kill women and children.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Flash'' (Vol. 3)===
In ''The Flash'' (Vol. 3), Captain Cold and the Rogues visit Sam Scudder's old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words ''In Case of Flash: Break Glass'' written on it and release beings from a Mirror World upon breaking it.&lt;ref&gt;''Flash Secret Files and Origins'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Captain Cold is told by Mirror Master he had discovered that the giant mirror is actually a slow acting poison.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' vol. 3 #5 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In the timeline of the 2011 company-wide reboot of all its superhero titles, [[The New 52]], Captain Cold is reintroduced as a younger man than in the previous timeline. His origin remains the same, however, his sister Lisa has not been the Golden Glider, and is instead dying of [[cancer]]. Upon learning that the hospital does not have enough energy to power a laser that could save her life, because of an EMP seemingly caused by the Flash, Cold blames him for everything that has happened to him, including a falling out with the Rogues, and decides to break the rules of their &quot;game&quot; and kill the Flash. Captain Cold has undergone experiments that have given him ice-based metahuman powers, including the ability to slow down the molecules around him, creating a field of inertia that reduces the Flash's speed to human level, allowing Captain Cold to touch him and effortlessly beat him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' vol. 4 #6 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He and the Rogues are set to return,&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' vol. 4 #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but later defeated them with help from Flash, and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

After freeing the Trickster and attending the meeting at the Justice League Watchtower, the Rogues return to Central and Keystone City, only to see that both have been destroyed by Gorilla Grodd. Grodd returns to Central City during the eclipse, while a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas is occurring. Grodd proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Gorilla City. Captain Cold sees the city's cops tied up from Grodd, and proceeds to free them. He then asks Mirror Master to help him get to the hospital where his sister is being held in order to check on her. While there, the Crime Syndicate send Black Bison, Hyena, Multiplex, Plastique and Typhoon to finish Grodd's work and destroy the hospital. The Rogues are able to hold them off, only to be interrupted by Deathstorm and Power Ring, who were sent by Ultraman to deal with the Rogues for resisting the Crime Syndicate's offer to join them. After battling Deathstorm and Power Ring, Deathstorm attacks Captain Cold and is able to extract his freezing powers from his DNA. Mirror Master attempts to get the Rogues out through the Mirror World, but Power Ring destroys the mirror causing the Rogues to be separated. Captain Cold ends up at Luthor and his Kryptonian clone's location where they are also joined by Black Manta, who has retrieved Black Adam from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Luthor realizes that, with the help of his clone, Black Adam, Black Manta, and Captain Cold, he may be able to stop the Crime Syndicate. Captain Cold and the rest of the squad, now joined by [[Batman]], [[Catwoman]], [[Sinestro]] and [[Deathstroke]], infiltrate the fallen Watchtower, where Black Manta kills the Outsider and Cold proceeds to shatter [[Johnny Quick]]'s right leg after having frozen the molecules in it with his cold gun. He then unmasks the hooded prisoner brought over from [[Earth-3]], revealing it to be Alexander Luthor, who is their version of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], Mazahs, who states he will kill them all.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; {{issue|date=June 2014}} After defeating the crime syndicate, Captain Cold is pardoned by the U.S government. Cold and Luthor become members of the Justice League.

===DC Rebirth===
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
Snart and the Rogues have yet to make a full appearance in the [[DC Rebirth]]'s storylines, though they are seen fleetingly watching a news report about the many newly created speedsters appearing throughout the city. Snart quips that it's time for the Rogues to leave Central City for a while. Visually the Rogues still seem to be based upon their New 52 appearances in this cameo, though when Snart later appears in one of Flash's memory flashbacks he has resorted to an even older look.

==Powers and abilities==
Like the majority of the Flash's rogues, Snart had no innate superhuman powers. He instead relied on his cold guns and instincts. Over the years Snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as:
* A cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly.
* Creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks. Cold uses this ability to slow down the Flash's movements.
* Bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain. Cold used this to kill Chill Blaine who murdered Cold's sister to make him suffer as much as possible.
* Creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the Flash.
* Forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies. Used to kill Chill Blaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible.
* An &quot;ice grenade&quot; which was stated to &quot;turn this place into an iceberg&quot;. Used to freeze everything in a large radius, and  the whole of Iron Heights during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.
* Creating &quot;mirages&quot; out of extreme cold-like heat.

Fellow ice-based villain [[Mr. Freeze]] has noted that Cold is the only cold-themed villain in the DC Universe to have mastered &quot;absolute zero&quot; with his weapons.

In the New 52 universe Captain Cold initially had metahuman ice powers, including the power to slow down the Flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by Absolute Zero, but these powers are later lost in the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' series when he is attacked by Deathstorm- the Earth-3 counterpart of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]- with Cold reverting to using his classic ice gun. Despite his lack of professional expertise, Cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; He's even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers; like his &quot;Cold Field&quot; which quick cools the atmosphere to the point everything caught in it grinds to a halt,&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' (2011) #38&lt;/ref&gt; or an auto activation function which triggers his Cold Gun's freeze ray via vocalized password input.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; During the Rebirth story line Snart augmented his Cold Gun even further by combining it with the Speed Force powered technologies by the science criminal cell called '''Black Hole'''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (2016) #16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
*Captain Cold appears in [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s series ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''. Here he robs a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] casino where some DC heroes and others are attending a boxing match between [[Cassius Clay]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted &quot;Wildcat&quot; Grant]]. Captain Cold bursts in and freezes [[Iris West Allen|Iris Allen]]'s hand attached to a phone, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] hears the call from his home and turns into the Flash, then stops Captain Cold from freezing Vegas via cryogenic detonators. While trying to escape, Flash crashes the copter with the henchwoman in and takes him down. The Flash then rewired his gun and it backfired on Captain Cold, freezing him inside in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''DC: The New Frontier'' #2 (April 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Based in the ''[[DC Super Friends]]'' universe, Captain Cold is part of a group of ice-themed villains called the &quot;Ice Pack&quot; that encased a city in ice and snow. The Ice Pack appear in ''DC Super Friends'' #16 (August 2009).
*A teen version of Captain Cold known as '''Kid Kold''' appeared in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic as an enemy of [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]]. Like his adult counterpart, Kold had a sister who was also a supervillain, dubbed '''Ice Kate'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans Go!'' #53&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 25th century Captain Cold is a heroic Captain Cold, named '''Commander Cold''' as part of the 25th Century cops known as [[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]] from [[Professor Zoom]]'s future, and the team's leader. Commander Cold's face, in the one shot of it without his shades, shows an uncanny resemblance to Barry Allen. He may be a descendant, or even a future version of Allen.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #1 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Captain Cold had made two appearances in the animated-continuity comic ''[[DC Animated Universe Comics|Justice League Adventures]]''. In issue #12, he and other ice-related villains encased an African city in ice.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League Adventures'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the alternate &quot;[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]&quot; timeline, the character is a hero going by the name '''Citizen Cold'''. He retains his current wardrobe and weaponry, and is Central City's main hero, with a museum similar to the [[Flash Museum]], and a Rogues Gallery similar to that of the Flash, though he has killed some of his opponents. It is hinted that his heroics are a cover to hide a terrible secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;fpcc1&quot;&gt;''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He is contacted by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to join in the fight against [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. When [[Thomas Wayne|Batman]] refuses to join, Citizen Cold declines as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; After Citizen Cold defeats [[Mr. Freeze|Mister Freeze]], he returns home and sees a news report that his sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]], has been arrested for killing their brutal father. When [[Wally West]] discovers Citizen Cold's true identity, that of a former low-level criminal, Citizen Cold confronts him before he can reveal this information, and freezes Wally in a block of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;fpcc1&quot;/&gt; Later, Citizen Cold invites [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]] to dinner, but it is interrupted by calls that his sister Lisa has been kidnapped by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. Citizen Cold tries to rescue Lisa, but the Rogues attack him for revenge on what he did to them. Citizen Cold is too late and Lisa is killed. Citizen Cold is injured while escaping and collapses outside his car near Iris.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Iris then brings him to her home. After he recovers, he gives her a key to his penthouse, and an offer to join him when he leaves Central City. He then goes after the Rogues, killing them all for what they did to his sister. When he returns home, he is confronted by Iris and the Pied Piper, who had revealed to her his murder of Wally. Citizen Cold attempts to kill Pied Piper, but Iris uses one of his own weapons to freeze him in a block of ice, just as he did to Wally.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #3 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the time when the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline was happening, Grid access the files of Rhonda Pineda where the [[Earth-Three|Earth-3]] version of Leonard Snart was a police officer alongside Mick Rory where they have been pursuing [[Johnny Quick|Jonathan Allen]] and Rhonda. When Jonathan and Rhonda wanted the two of them to fight to the death upon being captured, Mick won the fight only for him to be killed by Jonathan anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' Vol. 2 #26&lt;/ref&gt;
* Captain Cold appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, with [[Superman]]'s parents having been kidnapped by [[Mirror Master]], the Justice League begins a large manhunt for the Rogue and start their search in Central City with several League members fighting various Flash Rogues. Captain Cold first appears being confronted by the Flash in Central City, with the Flash dodging blasts of ice from his cold guns and demanding Mirror Master's location. When the Flash shoves Cold's guns against his shoulder and legs in midblast, freezing him in place, Cold hastily relents. He reveals the location of a villains' bar called World's End in Keystone City as a possible place where Mirror Master should be. As Flash leaves, Cold asks him to &quot;Do what you have to with Mirror Master but go easy on the rest of 'em, yeah? Heroes weren't the only ones lost in [[Metropolis]], you know?&quot; The Flash leaves and Cold has not been seen since.
* Captain Cold is among the mind-controlled villains who attack the heroes as they assault [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s Stronghold in [[JLA/Avengers]]'' #4.
* Captain Cold appears in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' prequel comic. Following the events of the first game, Cold is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]].

** The character first appears as a recurring villain on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''. His stolen [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] 'cold gun' was created by [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] to subdue a speedster, due to its ability to freeze anything to absolute zero temperatures. In the first season, Snart attempts to eliminate the Flash multiple times, eventually recruiting his former colleague, [[Heat Wave (comics)|Mick Rory]], to join forces against the new hero, giving his pyromanic accomplice a handheld flamethrower to do so. Now known as the supervillains Captain Cold and Heat Wave, the two end up being defeated by the Flash, only to escape with the aid of Snart's sister, [[Golden Glider|Lisa]]. Snart then captures Cisco and learns the Flash's secret identity of [[Barry Allen (Flash)|Barry Allen]], with whom he makes a deal: Snart will keep Barry's identity a secret and refrain from killing innocent people, and in exchange Barry will not interfere with his heists. Barry later requests Snart's help with a [[metahuman]] prison transfer, and in exchange Barry eliminates all records of Snart the authorities possess. However, Snart then betrays Barry by freeing the inmates from captivity, stating that they would make a great addition his &quot;Rogues&quot; crew. In season two, Snart is blackmailed into working with his abusive father, Lewis, who plants a bomb in Lisa to ensure his son's cooperation. When the bomb is deactivated, Snart kills his father in retaliation. Despite being apprehended, Snart is later freed from prison by [[Weather Wizard|Mark Mardon]], but instead leaves Central City.
***On Earth-2, one of the Snart family is mentioned to be the mayor of Central City.
** Snart returns as a main character in the first season of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. He and Mick are recruited into [[Rip Hunter]]'s team, which is formed to prevent the immortal [[Vandal Savage]] from conquering the world; the two join the time-travelling crew to steal valuables from the past before they are discovered. In the episode &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, Snart attempts to alter his own past and prevent the cycle of abuse he and his sister suffered at the hands of their father. But unfortunately, Snart learns that the timeline always finds a way to restore itself. Later Snart starts to reform, becoming a true hero, which leads him to confrontation with Mick. When Heat Wave later betrays the team, Snart maroons his partner in an isolated area. A vengeful Rory then returns as the Time Masters' temporal bounty hunter [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]], and subsequently captures Snart for abandoning him. Snart later manages to escape, and convinces the team to try and reform Rory after they defeat him. They eventually succeed, and Rory rejoins the team. Near the end of the season, Snart is instrumental in defeating and capturing Savage by convincing his [[Scandal Savage|daughter]] to turn against him. In &quot;Destiny&quot;, Snart sacrifices himself to save Rory and ensure the team's survival after they learn that the Time Masters have been working with Savage and manipulating the team for their own ends. In the series, Snart has a blossoming romance with [[White Canary#In other media|Sara Lance]] which reaches its peak when the two share a kiss before Leonard sacrifices himself to put an end to the Time Masters.  Miller is confirmed to reprise his role as Captain Cold in season two, as a recurring character and a member of the [[Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/legends-tomorrow-legion-doom-season-913953|title=Comic-Con: 'Legends of Tomorrow' to Tackle Legion of Doom Villain Team In Season 2|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Snart's return, Rory gives his former cold gun to teammate Ray Palmer, allowing Palmer to continue acting in the field after the destruction of his exo-suit. Later Rory starts to see hallucinations of Snart, trying to make him indulge his villainous impulses. In the episode &quot;Fellowship of the Spear&quot;, a past version of Snart is recruited for the [[Legion of Doom]] prior to joining the Legends. Like Thawne and Darhk, Snart also intends to prevent his future death. Snart convinces Rory to betray the Legends and join the Legion, bringing the Spear of Destiny with him, allowing the Legion to rewrite reality to fit their goals. However, Rory eventually turns back to the Legends when he becomes disillusioned with the new world, and while Snart manages to kill Amaya in the new timeline while Thawne destroys the Spear, the remaining Legends are able to go back in time and prevent the Legion using the Spear in the first place. With the future Legends having sacrificed themselves to restore the timeline and Thawne killed by the Black Flash, the Legends' original counterparts return the various Legion members to their original times, erasing Snart's memories as he is returned to 2014.

'''Captain James Hook''' is a fictional character, the antagonist of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' and its various adaptations, in which he is [[Peter Pan]]'s [[archenemy]]. The character is a [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the [[brig]] ''Jolly Roger''; Barrie identifies him as [[Blackbeard]]'s former [[bo'sun]]. His two principal fears are [[Blood phobia|the sight of his own blood]] (supposedly an unnatural colour) and the crocodile who pursues him after eating the hand cut off by Pan. An [[Transradial prosthesis|iron hook]] replaced his severed hand, which gave the pirate his name. After getting a taste of Hook, the crocodile pursues him relentlessly, but the ticking clock it has swallowed warns Hook of its presence.&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J.M. ''Peter and Wendy''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the character==

Hook did not appear in early drafts of the play, wherein the capricious and coercive [[Peter Pan]] was closest to a &quot;villain&quot;, but was created for a front-cloth scene depicting the children's journey home. Later, Barrie expanded the scene, on the premise that children were fascinated by pirates, and expanded the role of the captain as the play developed. The character was originally cast to be played by [[Dorothea Baird]], the actress playing [[Mary Darling]], but [[Gerald du Maurier]], already playing George Darling (and the brother of [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies]]), persuaded Barrie to let him take the additional role instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/introduction.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102032812/http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk:80/introduction.html |archivedate=2 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a casting tradition since replicated in many stage and film productions of the Peter Pan story.

According to [[A.N. Wilson]], Barrie &quot;openly acknowledged Hook and his obsession with the crocodile was an English version of [[Captain Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Ahab]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/anwilson/3563080/Moby-Dick-a-modern-tragedy.html A.N. Wilson. &quot;Moby-Dick – a modern tragedy.&quot; The Telegraph, 27 October 2008.] Retrieved 25 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and there are other borrowings from [[Herman Melville|Melville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/460839?uid=3738736&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103561907431 David Park Williams. &quot;Hook and Ahab: Barrie's Strange Satire on Melville.&quot; ''PMLA'', December 1965.] Retrieved 25 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography of the character==

Barrie states in the novel that &quot;Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze&quot;, and relates that Peter Pan began their rivalry by feeding the pirate's hand to the crocodile. He is said to be &quot;Blackbeard's bo'sun&quot; and &quot;the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Barrie, J.M. ''Peter and Wendy'', Chapter 4. Hodder &amp; Stoughton (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[Treasure Island]], one of the names [[Long John Silver]] goes by is Barbecue.)&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, M. ''The Annotated Peter Pan''. W.W. Norton &amp; Co. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play, it is implied that Hook attended [[Eton College]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]&lt;ref&gt;McConnachie and JMB, ''Captain Hook at Eton – Speeches by JM Barrie'', Peter Davies Publishing. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; and his final words are &quot;Floreat Etona&quot;, Eton's motto. In the novel, Hook's last words are &quot;bad form&quot;, in disapproval of the way Peter Pan beats him by throwing him overboard.

==Appearances==
[[File:Captain Hook.PNG|150px|thumb|right|1912 illustration by [[Francis Donkin Bedford]]]]

===[[Peter and Wendy|''Peter Pan'' (play) and ''Peter and Wendy'' (novel)]]===
Hook is described as &quot;cadaverous&quot; and &quot;blackavised&quot;, with blue eyes and long dark curls resembling &quot;black candles&quot;. In many [[pantomime]] performances of ''Peter Pan'', Hook's hair is a wig, and is accompanied by thick bushy eyebrows and moustache. The hook is fixed to his right hand (often changed to the left hand in film adaptations) and is used as a weapon. He is also described as having a &quot;handsome countenance&quot; and an &quot;elegance of ... diction&quot;&amp;nbsp;– &quot;even when he [is] swearing&quot;. Barrie describes &quot;an attire associated with the name of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts&quot;. Hook's cigar holder enables him to smoke two cigars at once. Barrie also stated in &quot;Captain Hook at Eton&quot; that he was, &quot;in a word, the handsomest man I have ever seen, though, at the same time, perhaps slightly disgusting&quot;. Although Hook is callous and bloodthirsty, Barrie makes it clear that these qualities make him a magnificent pirate and &quot;not wholly unheroic&quot;.

In the animated film ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', Hook is a far more comical villain than the original character: he is seen as a vain coward with a childish, infantile temper who is prone to crying out in terror. During the film's early development, the story department analysed Hook's character as &quot;a fop... Yet very mean, to the point of being murderous. This combination of traits should cause plenty of amusement whenever he talks or acts&quot;.&lt;ref name=villains&gt;Thomas, Frank &amp; Johnston, Ollie (1993) ''Disney Villain'' &quot;Chapter 4: Nine Old Men,&quot; section: &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, pages 109–113. ISBN 978 1562827922&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] was the directing animator of Hook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Frank &amp; Ollie's Official Site|title=Feature Films: ''Peter Pan''|url=http://www.frankandollie.com/Film_Features.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Free Library|title=Frank Thomas Obituary|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/OBITUARY+ANIMATOR+FRANK+THOMAS,+DREW+%27TRAMP,%27+%27PINOCCHIO%27-a0121971073}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Disney's Platinum release bonus features, Hook was modeled after a Spanish King. One director insisted that Hook should be a darker villain with no comedic traits; but this was refused for fear of frightening a juvenile audience, and Hook became a comical villain, equally matched with Peter Pan.&lt;ref name=&quot;villains&quot; /&gt;

Actor [[Hans Conried]] set the tone for Disney's interpretation of Hook, as he was the original voice for the Captain, as well as, in the tradition of the stage play, Mr. Darling, and performed live-action reference for the two characters.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Captain Hook: Character History|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/villains/hook/hook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern animation, Hook is voiced by [[Corey Burton]].

Hook seeks revenge on Peter Pan for having fed the crocodile his left hand, and refuses to leave [[Neverland]] prior to this revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives&quot; /&gt; (citation address outdated) Throughout the film, Hook is supported by Mr. Smee. After promising [[Tinker Bell]] not to lay a finger (or a hook) on Peter Pan, he plants a bomb in Peter's hideout (instead of Barrie's vial of [[poison]]). At the conclusion of the film, Hook is chased by the crocodile into the distance, with the rest of the crew trying to save Hook. [[Walt Disney]] insisted on keeping Hook alive, as he said: &quot;The audience will get to liking Hook, and they don't want to see him killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;villains&quot; /&gt;

In the sequel ''[[Return to Never Land]]'', Hook mistakes Wendy's daughter Jane for Wendy, and uses her as bait to lure Peter Pan to his death. After this fails, he promises to take Jane home if she will help him find the island's treasure, and &quot;not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan's head&quot;. This last promise is kept when he pulls a single hair from Peter's head, declaring &quot;the rest of him is mine&quot;. At the end of the film, he and the crew are pursued into the distance by a giant octopus.

In the [[Disney Junior]] series ''[[Jake and the Never Land Pirates]]'', Hook serves as the series antagonist, with [[Jake and the Never Land Pirates#Recurring characters|his mother, Mama Hook]], herself exclusive to the Disney Junior series, keeping him &quot;honest&quot; if he gets tempted.

He stars in the [[Disney Interactive]] computer game, ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'', wherein the player defeats Hook and returns Peter to his rightful age. Hook also appeared frequently on ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', and was one of the main villains of ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]'' and made a special guest cameo on ''[[Raw Toonage]]'' in the episode hosted by [[Don Karnage]] of ''[[TaleSpin]]'', wherein he challenged Karnage to a sword fight for a treasure chest and won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sheerluck Bonkers / All Potato Network / The Puck Stops Here|episodelink= |series= Raw Toonage|airdate=1992-09-26|season= |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hook's origins are explored in the [[Disney Fairies]] film ''[[The Pirate Fairy]]'', voiced by [[Tom Hiddleston]].&lt;ref&gt;http://family-room.ew.com/2013/08/09/christina-hendricks-tom-hiddleston-the-pirate-fairy/&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, Hook pretended to be a pirate ship's cabin boy and befriended a rebellious fairy Zarina who had left Pixie Hollow after being dismissed as a dust-keeper when her unauthorised experiments with pixie dust led to a disaster. Hook foresaw great potential of the pixie dust and let Zarina think she had the authority over pirates.

Occasionally, Hook appears in the [[Scrooge McDuck universe]] of [[comic book]]s as the nemesis of [[Duck family (Disney)#Moby Duck|Moby Duck]], a [[whaler]] cousin of [[Donald Duck]].

====Video games====

=====Kingdom Hearts=====
{{nihongo|'''Captain Hook'''|フック船長|Fukku Senchō}} appears in the Action/RPG game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', in cooperation with [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]] and other villains. He uses his pirate ship to travel between worlds.

He takes [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] along with him, where [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]] is being held. Hook does not like Riku's bossiness and regrets taking him along; nonetheless, he follows his orders, as Riku now has control over the Heartless and would most likely unleash them on him should he disobey. When [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]] arrive in [[Neverland]], Riku throws them in the hold where they meet and escape with [[Peter Pan]], who is searching for his friend Wendy. Captain Hook believed that Wendy was a &quot;Princess of Heart&quot; and that is why he captured her. However, Riku reports to him from Maleficent that Wendy is not a Princess of heart at all, irritating Hook (he hints that kidnapping Wendy was a very difficult task). After defeating the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts|Heartless]] below deck, Sora fights a copy of himself summoned by Riku in Hook's office. After confronting Hook on the deck, learning that Riku took Kairi to [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Hollow Bastion]], Sora and company are forced to surrender when Hook uses Tinker Bell as a hostage. When the crocodile appears, Hook flees to his office while telling Smee to have their prisoners walk the plank. However, Peter Pan returns to save Sora before imitating Smee to trick Hook out to the deck, resulting in the villain being thrown overboard and chased into the horizon by the crocodile.

He later reappears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', finding a large amount of treasure maps all leading to boxes that are actually set to release Heartless once Hook opens the chest (unknown to Hook and Smee, however, is that these chests were set up to help build Pete's Heartless army). In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' he appears as a figment of Sora's memories and is absent in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Hook later appears in the game series prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', where he tricks Terra into attempting to kill Peter Pan for him. He later kidnaps Tinker Bell and takes Mickey Mouse's star fragment, but is defeated by Ventus and thrown into the water, where the crocodile chases him off. His Japanese voice actor was [[Chikao Ōhtsuka]] up until ''Birth by Sleep'', where Chikao Ōhtsuka was cast as Master Xehanort and Hook thus voiced by [[Naoya Uchida]]. His English voice actor is [[Corey Burton]].

=====''Epic Mickey''=====
Captain Hook is also featured prominently in the [[Wii]] game, &quot;[[Epic Mickey]]&quot;, wherein he has been converted into an animatronic, cyborg version of himself (referred to in the game as a Beetleworx) and is waging an attack against the non-converted pirates. Smee requests that [[Mickey Mouse]] find a way to save Hook. Players can either fight Hook by themselves and earn a thinner upgrade (and a &quot;bad ending&quot;), or free the [[Tinker Bell|Sprite]] and have [[Peter Pan]] defeat him and earn a paint upgrade (and a &quot;good ending&quot; showing Peter Pan and Captain Hook in a duel). In ''[[Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two]]'', Hook has disappeared entirely, leaving his crew leaderless and having been run out of Tortooga by [[Blackbeard]] and Pete Pan having joined up with the Mad Doctor after losing his purpose. Some of Hook's clothes and items have been left behind in Ventureland, which the crew members seek to assert their authority to take over leadership of the other pirates and lead them to take back their home.

The Cartoon World's version of Hook appears in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'' as the first boss, having fallen under the control of Mizrabel to fight Mickey. Upon his defeat, he comes to his senses and offers his help to Mickey's quest to bring the toons back to the Cartoon World.

====Attractions and live events====
Captain Hook also appears at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts as a [[meetable character]], as well as part of the dark ride [[Peter Pan's Flight]].

In [[Fantasmic!]] at Disneyland, there is a scene in which we see Captain Hook and Peter Pan duelling aboard the Jolly Roger (portrayed by the [[Sailing Ship Columbia]]). This is replaced by a short re-enactment of Disney's [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

At Disney World's Dream-Along with Mickey show, Hook, along with Smee, is one of the villains that crashes Mickey's party. This happens when Peter and Wendy appear to make [[Goofy]]'s dream for some adventure come true and play a game of &quot;Pretend to Be Pirates&quot; with [[Donald Duck]], who pretends to be the captain until the real Hook appears and challenges Peter to a duel. At first, Hook's appearance seems to take place for no reason other than to add some action to the show, but is revealed to actually be working for Maleficent, who is insulted after not being invited to the party. He is defeated by [[Mickey Mouse]], who leads the audience in a chant of &quot;Dreams come true!&quot;, and scares off the villains.

At the Disney Villains Mix and Mingle Halloween Dance Party at [[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]], Hook is summoned up by Maleficent along with the other villains, and co-hosts along with her, revealed by him being the only one of the villains beside her to sing and also being the villain that dances with her.

Captain Hook was also featured in the [[Disney on Ice]] 2013 show 'Let's Party' as part of the Halloween celebration section, which takes the format of a party hosted by [[Jack Skellington]] where all the 'main' Disney villains attend ([[Evil Queen]] and [[Jafar]] being two other notable villains in the scene) and they plan to capture [[Mickey Mouse]] to plunge everyone into unhappiness.

Captain James Hook is played by [[Dustin Hoffman]]. Hook kidnaps the children of the adult Peter to lure his arch-enemy back to Neverland and gives the middle-aged man three days to rekindle his spirit. Hook has been somewhat depressed since Peter Pan left Neverland to become Peter Banning ([[Robin Williams]]), and Hook worries he has nothing left to accomplish; he has long since killed the crocodile and made it into a quiet clock tower. Despite defeating the crocodile, he remains terrified of a clock's ticking. At Mr. Smee's suggestion, Hook attempts to persuade Peter's children that their father never loved them, in order to coerce them to stay in Neverland. He is successful with Jack, Peter's son, who soon sees Hook as the attentive [[father figure]] that Peter has never been. Peter's daughter, Maggie, mistrusts Hook immediately and refuses to be swayed. Hook decides to hold Maggie hostage until Peter's failure to rescue her ruins her faith in him. This backfires when Peter and the Lost Boys rescue her immediately. Jack sees Hook stab Rufio to death in duel, and realizes how much his father cares for the Lost Boys. Jack turns against Hook and embraces his real father. As Peter leaves the ship with his children and the Lost Boys, Hook orders him to come back. Maggie tells him off, stating Hook needs a mother to straighten his bad attitude.  After Hook vows to kidnap future generations of children in Peter's family, Peter and Hook engage in a final duel amidst a circle of Lost Boys, wherein Hook is apparently &quot;eaten&quot; when the crocodile clock tower falls on him.

Hook's missing hand is his left and his stump takes other attachments, including a baseball mitt and a pointer. He dresses very elegantly with a gold-trimmed red coat, matching hat, and a wig that hides his balding head. He wears a ceremonial captain's sword at his side, but uses a proper dueling sword when fighting Rufio and Peter. Hook's physical appearance in the film is heavily influenced by Disney's portrayal, though with more elaborate clothing trim and his mustache is curled, but he is closer to Barrie's characterization as a gentleman pirate than in Disney's version; for instance, he frequently describes certain behaviors as &quot;good form&quot; or &quot;bad form.&quot; Hoffman claimed to have based the character's voice and mannerisms on conservative columnist [[William F. Buckley]].

}}
In the 2003 film adaptation of ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]]'', Captain James Hook is portrayed by English actor [[Jason Isaacs]], who also plays the role of George Darling, Wendy's father, following the tradition of the original play. Isaacs wears the hook on his right hand, supported by a shoulder harness. Hook is feared and ruthless, but also gentlemanly. In the climactic duel, Hook learns to fly, thus almost defeating Peter; the Lost Boys' taunts weaken the enthusiasm Hook needs to fly, and he falls into the crocodile's mouth.

===''[[Peter Pan in Scarlet]]''===
[[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s [[Peter Pan in Scarlet|authorized sequel]] to ''Peter Pan'' gives Peter a new nemesis, while bringing back the old favourite.

Ravello, a [[circus]] man in a constantly ragged woollen [[coat (clothing)|coat]], offers Peter a servant and to ensure his well being in the search for the [[treasure]]. Ravello provides – through a red coat and a bad influence – that Peter Pan is increasingly in the direction of Captain Hook turns. He sees himself not as a living person, because he only eats [[egg (food)|eggs]] and no longer sleeps there. He is revealed in the middle of the book to be the old James Hook, who escaped the [[crocodile]], when the muscle contractions of the [[stomach]] meant to crush and [[digestion|digest]] Hook, which broke the [[vial]] of [[poison]] Hook kept with him at all times. The poison killed the crocodile, and Hook used his [[Prosthesis|hook]] to claw out, but he was [[mutated]] by the [[stomach acid]], changed Hook to an uglier man. The scarred visage that emerged from the crocodile's stomach was not the noble pirate who went forthwith from the deck of the ''Jolly Roger'', but Ravello, the travelling man. Ravello has many animals in front [[lions]], [[bears]], and [[tigers]].

Ravello gives another clue to his true identity when one of the Lost Boys asks Ravello his name: he thinks for a while, as if trying to remember, and finally says the name his mother gave him was Crichton, but that names given by mothers don't mean anything.

One of Ravello's trophies is an Eton trophy dated 1894. If Hook was 18 – the last year of an Etonian – in that year, then he was born in 1876, a full one-hundred and one years after his appearance at The Pirates' Conference [see below], and even further after the times of [[Blackbeard]] and [[Long John Silver]]. It must also be said that Hook in this book denies that he was ever with Blackbeard, claiming that he would never have served such an uneducated man and that all suggestions that he has are merely rumours started by his enemies. Only upon receiving Wendy's kiss, and five weeks' worth of sleep, does the real James Hook again reveal himself.

===''Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth''===

According to the (non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]]) novel ''Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth'', Captain Hook was the illegitimate son of a nobleman, &quot;Lord B&quot;, and an unnamed woman Hook has never met (implied to be the Queen). Disowned by Lord B., James Matthew is reared by a Shakespearean actress he calls Aunt Emily, and unwillingly attends Eton College as an Oppidan scholar, where he is an avid reader of Shakespeare and Shelley, and his motto is &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;. He describes many things as first rate – &quot;Topping Swank&quot;, and punctuates his sentences with &quot;The End&quot;. He is very interested in the [[French Revolution]].

In this novel James has only a few friends including Roger Peter Davies, whom he nicknames &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; (the name of his ship in later life), and the spider 'Electra'. A seventeen-year-old Colleger, Arthur Darling (named after Arthur Llewelyn Davies) is his rival in studies, fencing, sports, and the attentions of the visiting [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultana Ananova Ariadne. When James successfully woos Ananova, their affection sets off political outrage that affects the noble position of Lord B., who arranges for James to leave Eton on his trading ship, the ''Sea Witch''. Upon leaving, James defeats Arthur in a final duel and burns his own school records to leave no traces of his behaviour. On the ''Sea Witch'', he befriends [[boatswain]] Bartholomew Quigley Smeethington, generally called [[Smee]], frees the slaves aboard ship, overthrows the ship's captain (killed by Electra), and murders the quartermaster with a metal hook.

Throughout ''Capt. Hook'', author J.V. Hart relates events in James Matthew Barrie's life and the lives of the Llewellyn Davies children. The narrative expands upon details of Barrie's original play and novel, but ascribes James's unusual colouring and yellow blood to a blood disorder, makes James's long dark hair natural, rather than the usual wig, and has James titled &quot;Hook&quot; after murdering the quartermaster of the ''Sea Witch'', rather than in reference to his prosthetic hand.

===''Peter and the Starcatchers''===

In the novel ''[[Peter and the Starcatchers]]'' by [[Dave Barry]] and [[Ridley Pearson]], Captain Hook is distinguished by [[halitosis]], beady black eyes, a pock-marked face, and perpetual filth of his person and surroundings, contrasting strongly with J. M. Barrie's Etonian gentleman. The novel, which takes place before the Captain meets Peter Pan, calls Hook &quot;Black Stache&quot; for his prominent moustache, and his ship is called the ''Sea Devil''; he captures the ''[[Jolly Roger]]'', originally a British ship called the ''Wasp'', later. Black Stache is renamed 'Captain Hook' in the second instalment, ''Peter and the Shadow Thieves''. In Barry and Pearson's book, his left hand is accidentally cut off by Peter.

In Rick Ellis' theatrical adaptation of the Barry-Pearson novel, Black Stache (portrayed in the original production by [[Christian Borle]], who won a [[Tony Award]] for the role) is a witty, poetical, but psychotic pirate prone to [[malapropism]]s and the occasional [[Pratfall effect|pratfall]]. Similar to the Disney film character, Black Stache resembles both a dangerous villain and a comic buffoon. The last of a line of villains, he seeks to become a great villain by fighting a great hero, and finds one in Peter. His hand is cut off not by Peter, but accidentally severed when he slams the lid of a trunk in a fit of a rage.

Hook has a second hook-hand that both looked and functioned in a similar like a crab claw.

He is voiced by [[Chikao Ōhtsuka]], who also portrayed the Disney incarnation of the character in Japanese media, particularly in [[Kingdom Hearts]] and [[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]].

====''Peter Pan and the Pirates''====
In 1990, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] produced the television series ''[[Peter Pan and the Pirates]]'', wherein Hook's costume was more early 18th century rather than the classic [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]-[[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. He had white hair and wore black clothes. He was also clean shaven, without a moustache. Hook's personality is closer to Barrie's original character: he terrifies his crew, brutalises his enemies, has no fear (except of the crocodile), shows great intelligence, and is passionate about [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. He was voiced by [[Tim Curry]], who won an [[Emmy]] for this part.

====''Pirates of the Caribbean''====
In [[A. C. Crispin]]'s 2011 novel ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Price of Freedom]]'', Captain Hook appears in a conversation between [[Captain Teague]] and Pirate Lord Don Rafael: &quot;You'll never guess who I encountered at Oporto a few months ago. [...] James. [...] He's lost a hand. [...]he said it wasn't so bad, the hook was as good as a dagger in a fight. [...] He didn't look a day older, not a day. [...] James was a lot more...subdued. [...] The taberna keeper's little lad came round to collect our plates, and when he turned and saw he, for just a second he looked—scared. No, worse than that. Terrified. [...] Can you imagine that? Afraid! Of a young boy!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crispin|first=A. C.|title=Price of Freedom|year=2011|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=978-1-4231-0704-0|url=http://www.accrispin.com/The%20Price%20of%20Freedom%20excerpt%201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early concept arts for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' showed a pirate similar to Captain Hook as one of the Pirate Lords of the Fourth Brethren Court.

'''Luke Carlyle''' is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]], created by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASM&quot;&gt;{{Comic book reference|writer=[[J. Michael Straczynski]]|penciller=[[John Romita, Jr.]]|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] (second series) #43-45|date=Oct-Nov 2002|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Luke Carlyle &lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #43&quot;&gt;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #43&lt;/ref&gt; is a thief and [[confidence trick|con man]] who worked his way up the corporate ladder, eventually rising to a trusted position.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #43&quot;/&gt; When the CEO of the company he worked at discovered Carlyle was a fraud, Luke killed him. Lacking the time to act, and with most of the company's assets either gone or unreachable, Carlyle then hired [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] under the guise of helping to make him a legitimate researcher, and stole his mechanical appendages. Carlyle had the scientists at his company copy Octavius' [[cybernetics|cybernetic controller]], something that &quot;looked like it was made in the 1960s&quot;, into a new six-armed [[powered exoskeleton|power suit]]; his company had managed to duplicate most of the tentacles, but the cybernetic interface had required a direct look at the original device. He went on to commit a major bank robbery, but Octavius, who had been left alive but trapped in a small container with limited oxygen in case Carlyle needed to talk to him later about any problems the tentacles might develop, managed to escape imprisonment, having lied about the limitations of his control over his tentacles to claim that steel totally blocked his ability to control them when it actually just made it more difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #46&quot;&gt;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #46&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent fight between the two Doctors after Octavius tracked Carlyle to his hotel was relatively evenly matched, with Carlyle's superior technology being countered by Octavius's superior experience, but became more dangerous when [[Spider-Man]]- who was visiting [[Mary Jane Watson|his estranged wife]] during a movie shooting in Los Angeles- intervened, Spider-Man being nearly crushed in a collapsing hotel when he stayed behind to try and hold up support beams to give the civilians time to evacuate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #46&quot;/&gt; Despite a last attempt to escape by taking [[Aunt May|May Parker]] hostage, Carlyle was finally defeated by a combined effort between Octavius and Spider-Man, with Octopus cracking Luke's suit and Spider-Man filling the suit with webbing via the crack (Although Octavius informed Spider-Man that he only gave him this information to hurt Carlyle rather than to help him).&lt;ref&gt;Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #47&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Lucas &quot;Luke&quot; Carlyle (also called '''Carlyle the Mad Bomber''') appears as himself in the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. He is portrayed as a mad bomber. In the game, he was a wealthy business man whose business was destroyed when [[J. Jonah Jameson]] posted stories in the Bugle that got City Hall to investigate him. Fueled with revenge, he and his hired henchman go on a bombing spree. First he blows up his own building, which Spider-Man investigate where he stops some of his henchmen and saved one woman tied to a bomb. Later on, Jameson received an anonymous call that there were bombs planted all over the subway. Peter hears this call and rushes to the subway where he disarms all the bombs. Spider-Man later finds more of Luke's henchmen planting bombs all over the city using jet packs, but he is able to stop them and the bombs. It isn't until a chemical plant is under attack that Spider-Man finally meets Carlyle, where he and his henchmen were trying to steal a tank, but they are once again stopped. Luke escapes in a helicopter but not before throwing a bomb at Spider-Man, who escapes after the entire factory caves in. The final act shows Luke attacking the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', planting bombs, and kidnapping Jameson, a cutscene revealing that he is a former industrialist seeking revenge on Jameson after Jameson's editorials revealed that his factories were causing mass pollution. After Spider-Man disarms all the bombs at the ''Bugle'', he chases after Luke's helicopter. Luke then places a neck brace on Jameson that will explode if he gets far away from him. He then throws Jameson out of the helicopter, but is caught by Spider-Man. After chasing the helicopter, Carlyle starts flying the helicopter around a building, occasionally firing missiles at Spider-Man from the helicopter, only for Spider-Man to defeat him by using his webbing to throw the missiles back at their source. Carlyle and the henchmen aboard managed to escape using jet packs, but Carlyle then sets off explosives in their suits stating that he was &quot;handing them their walking papers&quot;, while he escaped. The appearance of Luke in the game is slightly based on a villain called Turbo Jet who appears in [[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]

'''Malik &quot;Poot&quot; Carr''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', played by actor [[Tray Chaney]]. Poot starts out as a drug dealer in the [[Barksdale Organization]] who slowly rises through the ranks. He eventually ends up leaving the drug trade after its violent nature causes the death of his best friend [[Bodie Broadus]] and many other of his friends. He has the distinction, along with [[Wee-Bey Brice]], [[Omar Little]], [[Bubbles (The Wire)| Bubbles]] and [[Proposition Joe]], of being the only characters in the drug trade to appear in every season.

Of the seventeen front-line Barksdale Organization gang members featured in seasons one to three, twelve die during the course of the show and three more are imprisoned with long sentences. Poot in many ways is the &quot;sole survivor,&quot; and the foil to the heavy casualties suffered particularly by Barksdale's organization. This is despite the fact that he survives being shot at three times, more times than any other character except [[Omar Little]]. He distinguishes himself from the other remaining survivor, [[Slim Charles]], as the only one able to move away from drug trade after the organization's collapse.

==Biography==

===Season one===
In season one Poot works in the low rise projects territory called &quot;the pit&quot; under [[D'Angelo Barksdale]], and is friends with fellow dealers [[Bodie Broadus|Bodie]] and [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]]. He has a very active sex life, and at one point the police detail investigating the Barksdale Organization listens in on him having phone sex with a girlfriend. He is depicted as being a contemporary of Bodie and Wallace, making him about sixteen when the show starts.  

Poot is trapped in the stash house with other members of his crew when it is robbed by Omar. Although he doesn't get hurt, Poot is terrified enough to vomit when Omar leaves. He and Wallace spot [[Omar Little and Associates#Brandon Wright|Brandon]], Omar's boyfriend and accomplice in the heist. Wallace reports the sighting to D'Angelo, even though Poot doesn't believe anyone will come. [[Stringer Bell]] arrives soon afterwards with a trio of enforcers. Poot is not as affected as Wallace by the body of Brandon being displayed in their neighborhood as a warning to Omar. The trauma drives Wallace to stop working for the organization. Poot tries to get him to return to work, but he is unsuccessful. Poot follows Wallace and realizes he has turned to drugs to escape his problems. He covers for Wallace with D'Angelo for some time but eventually tells him the truth.

Poot's close friendship with Wallace is evident as he stays in touch with Wallace after the police move Wallace away to the country. Wallace tells Poot he has chosen to move to live with relatives, but in reality he became a police informant. Bodie is ordered to kill Wallace by [[Stringer Bell]] when he returns after growing suspicious of his long absence. During the lead up to the hit, Poot's closer friendship with Wallace made him the less confident of the two; however, when they cornered a fearful Wallace, who pleaded with his friends, Bodie showed much more hesitation. Only after Poot urged him to finish it did he pull the trigger. Although Bodie fired the initial shot, Poot took the gun from him and finished Wallace off himself, wanting to free his friend from his suffering. After the arrest of his one-time mentor and crew chief D'Angelo, Poot's willingness to continue to serve the Barksdale Organization was shown when he stepped into the position by helping Bodie physically force away a rival drug gang. In the closing scenes of season one, Poot is seen running the Pit, notably repeating some of the earlier lessons taught to him by D'Angelo to the crew currently working for him.

===Season two===
In season two Poot is still running the pit. However, he has difficulty controlling his subordinates and struggles with the poor quality product available to the crew. He is significant enough to the organization to attend Stringer's strategy meetings at a funeral home. He continues to work with Bodie who is now in control of his own tower and overseeing the pit. Bodie and Poot become embroiled in a turf dispute with an independent crew that leads to a firefight, in which Bodie, Poot and [[Barksdale Organization#Puddin|Puddin]] fight off six attackers. A child is killed by a stray bullet.

===Season three===
In season three the Barksdale organization is forced out of its prime territory by the city's demolition of the public housing towers - in the [[cold open]] of the [[Time After Time (The Wire episode)|season premiere]], Poot expresses his sadness at the loss of the towers, revealing that he lost his [[virginity]] in one of the buildings. It is during this sequence that Bodie reveals Poot's given name to be Malik Carr. Poot remains in charge of his own crew now working on a street corner. The Barksdale organization becomes embroiled in a turf war with the rival [[Stanfield Organization|Stanfield crew]]. Barksdale enforcer [[Slim Charles]] assures Poot that he will be safe to selling narcotics when the Barksdales try to expand into Stanfield territory and provides him with more muscle as protection. Poot narrowly escapes being shot in a drive-by on his corner carried out by Stanfield soldier [[Snoop (The Wire)|Snoop]], which kills Barksdale soldier [[Barksdale Organization#Rico|Rico]]. At the close of season three, Poot is arrested along with most of the other Barksdale members, implicated in drug dealing by a police wiretap.

===Season four===
In the second half of the season Poot is released from prison after serving fifteen months of a four-year prison sentence and immediately goes back to work with Bodie's crew. He is unhappy to learn that they are now working under Avon's old rival [[Marlo Stanfield]], but does not seem to mind the change too much.&lt;ref name = &quot;PC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | title = Character profile - Poot | publisher = HBO | accessdate = 2006-07-24 | url = http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/poot.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;OCS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| year = 2006 | title = Org Chart - The Street | publisher = HBO | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.hbo.com/thewire/orgchart/street.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poot is a source of advice for Bodie, who often looked to his old friend for help when trying to determine how to view Marlo's cutthroat operations. Poot was with Bodie and Spider when Marlo's crew attacks his corner. When it becomes clear that they are outnumbered, and that Bodie would rather die than flee, Poot fled the scene while Bodie chose to fight. Bodie is soon shot to death. When [[Jimmy McNulty]] later asks Poot who killed Bodie, Poot tells him that he blames the police for his friend's murder, as Bodie was seen getting into a car with McNulty by Stanfield's lieutenant, [[Stanfield Organization#.22Monk.22 Metcalf|Monk]]. Poot is briefly shown in the final montage of the season working for [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael Lee]], who took over Bodie's corner.

===Season five===
Poot is briefly seen working at a shoe store where [[Duquan &quot;Dukie&quot; Weems|Dukie]] comes in looking for a job. Poot recognizes Dukie and admits he used to work the corners, but says that he got tired of drug dealing and decided to get a legitimate job instead because, like for [[Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise]], dealing &quot;got old.&quot;  He tells Dukie he won't get hired because he is not old enough, and that he should come back after working the corners for a couple more years. This final appearance of Poot draws several parallels to Cutty, and signifies after much hardship he was able to successfully leave the drug trade behind him, an achievement which most of his peers never lived or hoped to accomplish.

'''Blake Alexander Carrington''' is a [[fictional character]] on the American TV series ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''. The role was portrayed by [[John Forsythe]] from the first episode of the series in 1981 until the finale in 1989. Forsythe returned for the 1991 [[miniseries]] ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Charlie's an Angel Now: John Forsythe Dies at 92|publisher= Time|date=2010-04-03|url= http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1977623,00.html#ixzz0yITk3bNe|accessdate=2010-09-01 | first=Richard | last=Corliss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forsythe is the only actor to appear in every episode of the series.

Patriarch of the [[Carrington family]], self-made CEO of monolithic Denver-Carrington, and the principal character of the series, oil tycoon Blake Carrington is initially a ruthless man in both business and family matters. The character soon softens into a more benevolent patriarchal figure due to the influence of actor Forsythe.

==Background==
Blake Alexander Carrington was born to Thomas and Ellen Lucy Carrington in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He has a younger brother, [[Ben Carrington|Benjamin]]. While working in the oilfields with his father, his ailing mother died in a house fire, which was blamed on Ben. This caused a rift between the brothers as Ben felt as if Blake had their father turn his back on him.

He served in [[World War II]], having mentioned in a season one episode, of being part of the [[Normandy landings]].

While attending the [[Colorado]] School of Mines at night, he worked as an oil rigger by day.

In 1955, while with [[Cecil Colby]] at an event, he met [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Morrell]] and he asked her dance to ''[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]''. Three days later, Blake proposed and within a month, they were married. In 1956, he and Alexis had their first born, [[Adam Carrington|Adam]]. Less than a year later, Alexis gave birth to their second born, [[Fallon Carrington Colby|Fallon]], but shortly before Adam's first birthday, he was kidnapped by Kate Torrance. Some time after, [[Steven Carrington|Steven]] was born.

In 1959, Blake founded Denver-Carrington with a single oil well. Throughout the years, the company expanded oil wells in the [[American Southwest]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Southeast Asia]] and expanded interests in refineries, tankers and reclamation, including an exclusive pioneering oil-shale extraction process. His success with Denver-Carrington often resulted in many competitors and enemies, such as Jason and [[Cecil Colby]].

He was injured in an oil rig explosion in 1964.

In 1965, he discovered Alexis in bed with the Carrington estates architect Roger Grimes and nearly beat him to death. He bribed a great number of people, including Grimes and Alexis, to make sure this affair was not publicized.

==Season one==
In the series premiere, Blake marries his secretary [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle Jennings]]. Their marriage is strained by her discomfort as she learns about Blake's ruthless side, especially in business. Blake rapes Krystle when she is reluctant to have sex with him. Blake struggles with his daughter [[Fallon Carrington Colby|Fallon]]'s promiscuity and his son [[Steven Carrington|Steven]]'s homosexuality. He catches his son in an embrace with another man, and in a fit of anger pushes them apart. Steven's lover falls, hits his head, and dies. Blake is arrested and charged with murder. In the season finale, a mysterious witness enters the courtroom. Visibly agitated, Blake turns to his lawyer and asks, &quot;What's she doing here?&quot;

==Season two==
The mystery witness is Blake's ex-wife, [[Alexis Colby|Alexis]]. She testifies to Blake's violent temper. He is found guilty, but given a suspended sentence. While Blake struggles to save Denver-Carrington from financial troubles, he is thrilled to learn that Krystle is pregnant. Krystle loses her baby in a horse riding accident. Blake suggests that Krystle meet with his friend, psychiatrist Nick Toscanni.

Later, Blake is blinded after mobster Logan Rhinewood bombs his car. Blake suspects that Krystle is having an affair with Nick, so after his sight returns he continues to feign blindness in order spy on her. In the season finale, he confronts Nick. The men are on horseback, and Blake is thrown from his horse. Nick leaves him unconscious on the ground.

==Season three==
Krystle finds Blake and gets him to help. Blake learns that Fallon's son, his namesake &quot;Little Blake&quot; has been kidnapped.
Blake and Alexis make a televised plea for the return of their kidnapped infant grandson L.B. Colby. While on the air, Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and never recovered. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children Fallon and Steven. Weeks later, an attorney from Billings, Montana, approaches Blake and claims to be Adam. Blake does not believe him, but eventually accepts him as his son - especially when Alexis does.

Blake learns that Krystle's divorce from her first husband was never official. He and Krystle are going through a bad patch and they separate.

Blake learns that Steven is missing and presumed dead in an oil rig explosion. He refuses to believe that Steven is dead. When Steven's ex-wife appears with a baby that she says is Steven's, Blake offers to keep the child. Later, he learns that Steven is alive. He flies to Singapore to convince him to return to Denver. In the third season finale, Blake learns that Steven is living with another man. Blake decides to sue for custody of his grandson.

==Season four==
Blake loses his custody fight when Steven marries [[Claudia Blaisdel Carrington|Claudia Blaisdel]]. However, they reconcile when Blake and Krystle remarry.

==Season five==
Blake mourns the death of his daughter, Fallon. Blake also learns that he has an illegitimate half-sister, [[Dominique Deveraux|Dominique]]. He accepts his sister after his father, [[Tom Carrington (Dynasty character)|Tom Carrington]], admits on his deathbed that she is his daughter.

A few months later, Blake learns that Alexis had another child after they divorced, a daughter [[Amanda Carrington|Amanda]]. Although Alexis denies that he is Amanda's father, he learns that she is, in fact, his daughter.

At Christmas, Blake is thrilled when Krystle has a baby girl. Although her health is fragile at first, she survives and thrives.

Blake grows jealous of Krystle's friendship with Daniel Reece. Meanwhile, Lady Ashley Mitchell attempts to seduce Blake. Someone has photos taken of both Blake with Ashley and Krystle with Daniel and has them sent to each other. However, both Blake and Krystle declare their love for each other.

The entire family attends the wedding of Amanda and Prince Michael of Moldavia, and rebels storm the chapel and spray the church with bullets.

==Season six==
Blake and his family survive the attack. Upon returning to Denver, Blake enters a business deal with Jason Colby and is shocked to discover that Fallon is alive, suffering from amnesia, and married to his son, Miles. Blake's health starts to deteriorate and he becomes almost completely incapacitated. It turns out that Krystle has been kidnapped and replaced with a look-alike named Rita Lesley, who has been slowly poisoning him. Sammy Jo (Krystle's niece) had hired her to help gain control over her inheritance, which is overseen by her aunt. However, Sammy Jo was unaware of the plot to kill Blake and upon learning the truth, helps Krystle escape captivity and informs Blake's doctor about the poisoning when he is rushed to the hospital after falling down the stairs during an attack. When the truth is exposed, Rita disappears and Krystle returns.

Blake is furious when his brother Ben returns to Denver. In league with Alexis, he sues for his share of their late father's estate. He mortgages his house and holdings on the hope that he will gain control over ColbyCo. Thanks to Ben and Alexis's interference, he loses both the house and the holdings and also his lucrative South China Sea oil leases. In the season finale, he learns that Alexis has bought his house. Furious, he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her.

==Season seven==
Krystle pulls Blake off of Alexis. Blake learns that his hotel, La Mirage, has burned down and that several people, including Claudia, have perished in the fire. Blake is charged with arson, but eventually the charges are dropped when it is revealed that Claudia was responsible for the blaze.

As Blake continues to try and regain his empire, he discovers that the land he inherited from his mother is rich in natural gas. However, he is forced to temporarily halt his plans to develop on the land when Alexis and Ben learn of its existence. Soon after, Emily Fallmont gives Blake damning information on Alexis and Ben and uses it to force them to relinquish their ownership of Denver-Carrington and all its holdings back to him.

Later on, Blake, Alexis, and Ben are in southeast Asia visiting an oil rig when it catches on fire. Ben rescues a trapped Blake moments before the rig explodes. Blake awakens in the hospital with no memories of the last 25 years. Alexis has him discharged from the hospital and convinces him that they're still married. However, when Krystle finds them, Blake's memories return.
Blake and Krystle's daughter, Krystina, falls ill and needs a heart transplant. A donor is found, Krystina is fine, but the donor's mother kidnaps Krystina. However, she is found unharmed.

In the season finale, at Adam's wedding, Blake and Alexis legally adopt Adam.

==Season eight==
Blake runs for governor, against the incumbent and Alexis running as an independent. He loses.
Not long after, he returns home to find his bedroom trashed and Krystle missing. He cries out: &quot;Oh, Krystle, I thought we had more time!&quot;

==Season nine==
Krystle has a serious brain tumor and must have risky surgery. They fly to Switzerland, where the surgery is successful but Krystle is left in a coma.

A body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Roger Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's late father had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon. The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Blake's late father. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by someone looking for the treasure.

In the last episode of the series, Blake learns that the police captain investigating the murder of Roger Grimes is behind the search for the treasure. Blake attempts to force a confession. The captain pulls a gun, and they both shoot. Blake is left lying in a pool of blood.

==''The Reunion''==
Three years later, in ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]'', Blake is being released from jail for the murder of Captain Handler. Along with his sons, Steven and Adam, and former son-in-law Jeff, Blake attempts to regain control of Denver-Carrington from an international consortium. He is also thrilled to find that Krystle has recovered from her coma. However, it is soon revealed that the Consortium has planted subliminal commands in Krystle's mind during the course of her recovery to assassinate Blake. Fortunately, her love for Blake proves to be too strong and she breaks their control over her.

'''Adam Henry Carter'''&lt;ref name=bbcprofile&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/spooks/characters/adamcarter.shtml |title=BBC – Spooks Personnel Files: Adam Carter |work=BBC.co.uk/spooks |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] from the [[BBC]] espionage television series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'', which follows the exploits of Section D, a [[counter-terrorism]] division of [[MI5]]. He is portrayed by British actor [[Rupert Penry-Jones]]. The character is a former [[MI6]] officer who takes charge as the chief of Section D, and hence the head protagonist following the departure of [[Tom Quinn (Spooks)|Tom Quinn]] in series three.

Adam Carter was created with the knowledge that [[Matthew Macfadyen]], who played Tom Quinn, would leave the series. The intention was that Adam would be different from Tom; the producers wanted a character who was a husband with an MI6 background. Rupert Penry-Jones was cast after three auditions. Before the sixth series finale aired, it was announced that Penry-Jones would leave the series. In the premiere episode of series seven, Carter is killed in a car bomb. His death was voted the fourth most shocking death in the series. Rupert Penry-Jones was awarded &quot;Best Actor&quot; at the [[Crime Thriller Awards]] for his portrayal of Adam Carter.

==Role in ''Spooks''==
Before joining Section D, Adam Carter was an MI6 officer who specialised in the [[Middle East]]. [[Oliver Mace]] ([[Tim McInnerny]]), chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, describes Carter as a &quot;loose cannon&quot;.&lt;ref name=ep301&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[List of Spooks episodes#ep17|Project Friendly Fire]] |series=[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]] |credits=[[Jonny Campbell]] (director); [[Howard Brenton]] (writer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=11 October 2004 |seriesno=3 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fluent [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speaker&lt;ref name=ep310&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[List of Spooks episodes#ep26|The Suffering of Strangers]] |series=[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]] |credits=Alrick Riley (director); [[Ben Richards (writer)|Ben Richards]] (writer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=13 December 2004 |seriesno=3 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has good [[countersurveillance]] skills.&lt;ref name=ep303&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[List of Spooks episodes#ep19|Who Guards the Guards?]] |series=[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]] |credits= Cilla Ware (director); Rupert Walters &amp; [[Howard Brenton]] (writer) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=25 October 2004 |seriesno=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one past operation, Adam worked a case in [[Damascus]] to recruit Syrian intelligence officer Farook Sukkarieh as a double agent to work with the Israelis and stop a string of [[suicide attacks]].

==Conceptual history==
[[File:Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins in the 2007 movie Persuasion.jpg|thumb|It took the producers months to choose [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as Adam Carter.]]
The producers were aware that [[Matthew Macfadyen]] would leave the series after playing [[Tom Quinn (Spooks)|Tom Quinn]] for two years, and they did not know whether he would return for the first two episodes. An eight- to nine-member team came up with the new character of Adam Carter.&lt;ref name=rupertpenryjonesdvd&gt;{{cite video |year=2005 |title=Rupert Penry-Jones |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 3) Disc 2 |people=Collins, Simon Crawford; Featherstone, Jane; [[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted Adam to have a different dynamic than Tom; the producers set up a girlfriend/boyfriend storyline in the first series &amp;ndash; with Adam, they wanted him to have a wife (Fiona Carter) who works in the Security Service, since married couples working in that environment are common.&lt;ref name=rupertpenryjonesdvd/&gt; They wanted Adam to be more animated and energetic than Tom.&lt;ref name=adamcarterdvd&gt;{{cite video |year=2005 |title=Adam Carter |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 3) Disc 2 |people=[[Howard Brenton|Brenton, Howard]]; Penhale, Faith; [[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Howard Brenton]] wanted him to have an MI6 background, and have something awful happen to him in the past. Brenton invented the backstory of [[Syria]] early on into the third series, which he wanted to revisit in the fourth series.&lt;ref name=adamcarterdvd/&gt;

Early on in the development process, the producers wanted to cast a &quot;brilliant actor&quot; with a strong screen presence. They discussed casting [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] for the role of Adam Carter early in the process, though it took months to finally decide to cast him.&lt;ref name=rupertpenryjonesdvd/&gt; Though Penry-Jones was aware of ''Spooks'' and its success, he had never seen any episodes. To be interested in the role, he spent a weekend catching up on the entire first and second series. He did not take long to decide, since his last leading role was four years previously, in 2000 in the [[Channel 4]] drama ''[[North Square]]''.&lt;ref name=rupertpenryjonesdvd/&gt; Adam was originally meant to be older, and more &quot;street.&quot; When he found acting &quot;street&quot; was too difficult, Penry-Jones acted more like himself.&lt;ref name=adamcarterdvd/&gt; He had to audition three times before the producers included him, four months before filming commenced.&lt;ref name=helgood/&gt;

On his first day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene in the middle of the first episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=2005 |title=Episode 3.1 |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 3) Disc 1 |people=[[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt a little wary replacing Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role.&lt;ref name=helgood&gt;{{cite video |year=2005 |title=Hellos and Goodbyes |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 3) Disc 5 |people=[[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=2005 |title=Series 4 |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 3) Disc 5 |people=[[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=2006 |title=An Elusive Peace – Series 4 Documentary |medium=Spooks DVD (Series 4) Disc 1 |people=[[Rupert Penry-Jones|Penry-Jones, Rupert]] |publisher=Contender Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the sixth series finale aired in December 2007, it was announced that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series sometime in series seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-502129/Explosive-end-nigh-Spooks-spy-Rupert.html |title=Explosive end is nigh for Spooks spy Rupert |first= |last= |date=14 December 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penry-Jones wanted to leave the series as he felt the character had run its course, as well as wanting to explore other venues.

In a DVD review of the third series of ''Spooks'', Michael Mackenzie of ''Home Cinema'' had mixed views of Adam's introduction, stating &quot;despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are almost exactly the same character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content/id/58650/spooks-season-three.html |title=Spooks: Season Three (2006); Region 2 DVD Video Review |first=Michael |last=Mackenzie |date=27 September 2005 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |work=Home Cinema |publisher=The Digital Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth series, Mackenzie felt more open towards Adam, stating Adam Carter &quot;isn't exactly James Bond [...] he doesn't jet around the world, bedding multiple women and engaging in fisticuffs atop precarious construction rigs, but he does rush around London with a gun in his hand and occasionally ends up on the receiving end of the odd beating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content/id/65812/spooks-season-5.html |title=Spooks: Season 5 (2006); Region 2 DVD Video Review |first=Michael |last=Mackenzie |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |work=Home Cinema |publisher=The Digital Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Blackwell of ''Enterline Media'' was receptive of Adam in the fourth series, as he felt Adam became &quot;more fleshed out and interesting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enterline2.tripod.com/mi5spooks_season4.html |title=MI-5/ SPOOKS Season 4 review |first=David |last=Blackwell |accessdate=6 October 2010 |work=Enterline Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blackwell was critical of Adam's role in the following fifth series, stating it is &quot;too much&quot; about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enterline2.tripod.com/spooksmi5_season5_part1.html |title=TV review: SPOOKS/ MI-5 season 5 Part 1 |first=David |last=Blackwell |accessdate=6 October 2010 |work=Enterline Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheila Carter''' is a [[fictional character]] from the American [[CBS Daytime|CBS]] soap operas ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. Created by [[William J. Bell]], the role was portrayed by [[Kimberlin Brown]] for many intervals on both soaps until 2006, when the character had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers]], and was portrayed by [[Michelle Stafford]].

Sheila is known as a [[villain]]. A significant portion of Sheila's history on both soaps revolves around her long-running conflict with [[Lauren Fenmore]], whom she had attempted to kill on multiple occasions. She also had conflicts with [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]], [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]], [[Amber Moore]], [[Phyllis Summers]], [[Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Taylor Hayes]], and [[Brooke Logan]].

==Casting and creation==
The role was portrayed by [[Kimberlin Brown]] for a total of 16 years. Her first run was on ''The Young and the Restless'' from 1990 to 1992,&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who: Sheila&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/yr/whoswho/sheila.php |title=About Y&amp;R: Who's Who in Los Angeles - Sheila Carter |publisher=''SoapCental'' |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the character crossed over to ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' from 1992 to 1998, again from May to November 2002, and again finally from September 26 to October 10, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who: Sheila&quot; /&gt; Despite being a regular cast member on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', Brown returned to ''The Young and the Restless'' for several guest appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

In July 2005, after a 10-year absence from ''The Young and the Restless'', it was announced that Brown was to reprise the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Returning&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/yr/news/2005/0711-brown.php |last=Kroll |first=Dan J. |title=Y&amp;R confirms the return of Kimberlin Brown |publisher=''SoapCentral'' |date=9 July 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Brown had been appearing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[One Life to Live]]'' as [[Paige Miller]], and Brown reportedly opted to leave the role when ABC was unable to match the financial terms of a contract offered to her by CBS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Returning&quot; /&gt; She returned on August 5, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/episodes/14560 |title=The Young and the Restless: Friday, 5th August 2005 |publisher=[[CBS]].com |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her run ended on January 11, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/episodes/14790 |title=The Young and the Restless: Wednesday, 11th January 2006 |publisher=[[CBS]].com |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that December, the character returned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/episodes/15268 |title=The Young and the Restless: Thursday, 28th December 2006 |publisher=[[CBS]].com |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though not portrayed by Brown, but by [[Michelle Stafford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/youngandrestless/actor/484/Michelle_Stafford/ |title=Michelle Stafford Playing Sheila Carter on The Young and the Restless |publisher=''She Knows Soaps'' |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition portrays [[Phyllis Summers]]. For the reason of Brown not returning to the role, the actress said: &quot;I had a bad accident last year, and when they wanted me back in November I really couldn't go at that time and that's why I came back looking like somebody else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Kimberlin Brown|year=2007|title=KB Interview Nov 2007|publisher=KOUS News|accessdate=16 September 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgq2KnKd2X8&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stafford only portrayed the role for two months until February 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/week/6/2007/episodes/ |title=The Young and the Restless: Friday, 9th February 2007 |publisher=[[CBS]].com |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the character was shot to death by her longtime enemy [[Lauren Fenmore]].

In 2009, reports speculated that Brown would reprise the role again on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/news/2009/1130-brown.php |last=Kerr |first=Luke |title=Could Kimberlin Brown Return to B&amp;B? |publisher=''[[Daytime Confidential]]'' |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by more rumors speculating a return to ''The Young and the Restless''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is Brown Returning?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/news/2009/1130-brown.php |last=Kroll |first=Dan J. |title=Is Kimberlin Brown returning to The Young and the Restless? |publisher=''SoapCentral'' |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I actually got a call from [''B&amp;B'' head writer and executive producer] [[Bradley Bell|Brad Bell]] a while back asking if I'd be interested in coming back, and I said, 'Sure!' The thing with daytime is that the storylines are [written] so far in advance, you just never know when [you might be needed],&quot; Brown said at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is Brown Returning?&quot; /&gt; When asked where her alter-ego may be &quot;hiding out&quot;, Brown said: &quot;I am still getting healthy from my car accident.

On the topic of Sheila and Lauren's &quot;cat fights&quot;, Brown said: &quot;People like cat fights because we can get away with what you can't get away with in everyday life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [boy] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it.

There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [I mean] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to.

So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Villains&quot; /&gt; Brown also added that, &quot;To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap Villains&quot; /&gt;

==Storylines==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
{{plot|date=September 2013}}

===1990–92===
Sheila was introduced on ''The Young and the Restless'' in 1990 as she relocated to [[Genoa City (fictional city)|Genoa City]] from [[Michigan]]. Sheila was a nurse who worked at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and immediately fell in love with the married [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]]. Her feelings for Scott quickly turned from infatuation to obsession. In order to steal him away from his wife [[Lauren Fenmore]], Sheila drugged him and had sex with him, resulting in a pregnancy. At the same time Lauren also became pregnant by Scott but didn't tell him. When the truth about the father of Sheila's baby came out, Scott felt obligated, so he thus divorced Lauren and married Sheila.

Sheila's baby died, unbeknownst to Scott, and she secretly switches Lauren's newborn with a [[black market]] baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from [[meningitis]]. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually found out about the baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], and his secretary, [[Lynne Bassett]]. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse turned out to be a meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in [[Los Angeles]]. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scott Jr.]]

===1992–2003===
In 1992, Sheila is reintroduced on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' and she quickly worms her way into fashion [[CEO]] [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]])'s life by becoming the company nurse at [[Forrester Creations]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as working as [[Rick Forrester]]'s nanny (after staging an accident that leaves the former nanny, Judy, hospitalized, and later threatening Judy and her family). Sheila and Eric fall in love and are eventually engaged, which angers Eric's ex-wife [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]), who suspects Sheila is a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]] and a liar.  To Sheila's dismay, Eric's most recent ex-wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) is pregnant with a child that may either belong to Eric or his son [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]). After [[Bridget Forrester]] is born, Sheila manipulates the paternity test so that everyone will believe Ridge is the father. Security guard [[Mike Guthrie]] (Ken Hanes) catches her in the act and after threatening to blackmail her with the details, Sheila sets loose a vicious dog to attack him.

Meanwhile, Lauren finds out that Sheila is alive and well, and living on the West Coast. Lauren follows her and they once again fight. Lauren threatens to expose Sheila to the Forrester family, but Sheila turns the tables on Lauren by [[blackmail]]ing her with pictures she took of Lauren sleeping with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]) and sent to Lauren as puzzle pieces.  Despite Sheila's love for Eric, she panics when Lauren attempts to disclose her past at the wedding, and leaves a heartbroken Eric at the altar.  After the guests leave, Sheila returns to the chapel and pleads for Eric's forgiveness.  Although Eric demands answers, he eventually forgives Sheila and the two are married. Sheila and Brooke become close friends.  Sheila and Eric's marriage becomes rocky when Sheila accepts a job from Brooke, who seizes control of Forrester Creations with her patent on the BeLieF formula.  Eric feels betrayed by her actions and a rift is created in their marriage.  Sheila proposes the two take a vacation and use this time to reconnect.  The two leave town for [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]].  Scott, who became ill, also vacations with Lauren in Catalina Island, where the two run into Eric and Sheila.  Lauren intends to use Scott to expose Sheila's past to Eric; however, Scott, still caring for Sheila, keeps mum.   Scott eventually dies on the island as a result of his illness.  With both women by his side, he wishes that Lauren give Sheila a second chance. Lauren tearfully agrees.

When Sheila becomes concerned that Eric is excluding her from his will, she decides she would be more financially secure if she gave Eric a child.  After a [[one-night stand]] with former rival Connor Davis (Scott Thompson Baker), Sheila goes to Eric claiming she is pregnant with his child. Eric, who had recently had a [[vasectomy]], tells Sheila he wants a divorce. For some time she begins to see [[psychiatrist]] Jay Garvin, who is friends with Brooke's fiance [[James Warwick (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Dr. James Warwick]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]). James suspects Sheila is hiding something from the family, and tries to pry information from Dr. Garvin.  However, during a brief struggle, Sheila accidentally pushes Jay off a balcony and to his death.  James later learns from Lauren the secrets of her past. After attempting to drown Lauren in a hot tub, Sheila kidnaps James with the help of her new partner-in-crime, the security guard Mike. She imprisons him in the basement of her house (known as &quot;The Houdini House&quot;) for some time. When James escapes and her secrets finally surface, she holds Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Brooke, Lauren and James hostage in the Forrester mansion, welcoming them to her &quot;goodbye party.&quot;

At the &quot;party,&quot; Sheila tells everyone in attendance how they had personally wronged her, and threatens to kill them. Holding a gun to Stephanie, Sheila has a change of heart when the others step in front of her, and swallows a bottle of poison. Having survived, Sheila is placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], under the care of Dr. Brian Carey ([[Kin Shriner]]), but does not remain there for long, despite Stephanie's attempts to keep her there. Sheila tries to revive her friendship with Brooke, who sides with her at first, but later wants nothing to do with her. She begins dating neighbor Grant Chambers ([[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Grant]]), and later her psychiatrist, James Warwick.  She continues to see James at this time, and memories of her [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood are revealed.  Sheila confesses that she murdered her father by poisoning him.

Sheila meets [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]), whom she befriends. The two are amazed to discover they both have ties to the same family.  When Stephanie attempts to take Brooke's children, however, Sheila poisons her by replacing her medication with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] pills, and ultimately frames Maggie for the crime. Maggie, later realizing who was behind the poisoning, fights with Sheila and accidentally pushes her onto a fire poker, impaling her. Sheila also makes an enemy of Forrester Creations' rival, [[Sally Spectra]] ([[Darlene Conley]]) who defends Stephanie to her, thus planting the seeds of the eventual friendship between Stephanie and Sally. After the fire poker incident, Sheila sets her sights on proving to James that she has changed for the better, in the hopes that he will fall in love with her. However, James has feelings for Maggie instead. Maggie goes to Sheila's house to inform her that she needs to find a new therapist, because Maggie wouldn't allow her to see James anymore. As Maggie taunts her, Sheila snaps and nearly chokes Maggie to death. Mike later kidnaps her and holds her prisoner at an amusement park. Sheila, wanting to prove to James that she had changed, agrees to release Maggie.

After having crashed James and Maggie's wedding, Sheila reveals that she has become pregnant after a night alone with James. The three come to a [[legal settlement|settlement]] that Sheila would temporarily stay with them until her baby was born, and the child would be given to James and Maggie.  After Sheila hands her baby, Mary, over to the Warwicks, she relocates to [[Death Valley]], where she meets [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]). Anxious to see her daughter, Sheila suggests that Amber babysit for James and Maggie, so that she can secretly visit Mary in LA. Amber is hired and keeps her alliance with Sheila secret for some time, but when Sheila threatens her, she exposes herself to James and Maggie.  Sheila eventually takes matters into her own hands and takes Mary back. James attempts to trick Sheila into marrying him, so that he can gain full custody of his daughter. When Sheila realizes the marriage is a set-up, she attempts to kill herself again by jumping off a roof.  James, who had actually fallen for Sheila during this time, promises to stay with her. Meanwhile, an angry Maggie sneaks into Sheila's hospital room and cuts off her [[oxygen]]. Sheila is rescued by doctors and Maggie is immediately arrested. With the help of Mike and his brother Martin, a desperate Maggie captures Sheila and holds her prisoner, appropriately, in the house from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].  When Sheila escapes, James demands that Maggie leave.  Maggie and Lauren later team up in an attempt to drive Sheila over the edge. They wire Sheila's house with hidden cameras and an audio system, while the former nanny Judy surprises Sheila on her doorstep.  The plan fails, however, and Maggie, realizing James and the baby are lost to her, leaves town. When a friendship begins between James and Stephanie, a [[paranoia|paranoid]] Sheila becomes jealous and attempts to drown Stephanie in a pool.  To prevent Stephanie from telling anyone about this incident, Sheila threatens to kill Stephanie's grandson, [[Thomas Forrester]].  Sheila is arrested for the threat, but secretly switches places with a woman named Sybil.  After breaking out of prison in disguise, Sheila shoots Stephanie, kidnaps baby Mary and leaves town.   
   
Sheila returns to L.A. four years later to find her now-teenage daughter [[Erica Lovejoy|Mary]] (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) ([[Courtnee Draper]]). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, [[Rick Forrester]], although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed.  Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a tank of [[bee]]s into his apartment.  Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her.  At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her to stay away from her daughter.  Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further.  Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother.  She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick.  Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.
    
As a reluctant Erica is about to carry out her mother's plan, Rick's brother Ridge bursts in and exposes Erica's true identity. Rick kicks Erica out, but not before Sheila kidnaps Amber, who is stunned to learn that Erica is really Mary Warwick.  Sheila stages a crime scene and drags Amber off to her apartment. [[Massimo Marone]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]), who had been romantically involved with Sheila for a short time, gets a call from her, and Stephanie recognizes her voice.  The two track Sheila and Amber down.  Sheila then flees and holds Eric and [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) hostage at the mansion. But when Brooke walks into the room, a struggle ensues in which Taylor and Brooke are shot. Brooke survives her wounds, whereas Taylor succumbs (a few years later, Taylor was revealed to still be alive). Sheila is arrested and subsequently confronted by her daughter, who condemns Sheila's actions and wants nothing to do with her. Sheila is jailed for her crimes but soon escapes with the help of a sympathetic warden named Sugar ([[Robin Mattson]]).   
   
She then kidnaps Ridge and Brooke, while on their [[South American]] [[honeymoon]]. Soon Ridge's half-brother [[Nick Marone]] ([[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]]) arrives to rescue Ridge but he is soon captured by Sheila as well. When Ridge and Nick's father, Massimo, arrives to deliver the ransom, Sheila reveals that she had a baby daughter, Diana, whom she claims to be the result of the fling she had with Massimo during her previous trip to L.A. When Massimo tries (unsuccessfully) to trick Sheila into handing over the infant, she and Sugar run away. Brooke and Nick are soon rescued; however, it is believed that Ridge had been burned to death in the foundry Sheila stashed him in. Soon after, it is revealed that Ridge had survived, and he reunites with Brooke on the island.

===2005–07===
Sheila returns to Genoa City (on ''The Young and the Restless'') after being unseen for ten years, and begins terrorizing Lauren once again, by indirectly turning her now-adult son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) against her, under the alias Brenda Harris. It is soon revealed that the woman in the psychiatric hospital who was believed to be Sheila is actually Sugar — Sheila had tricked her into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and then turned Sugar in to the police. Meanwhile, the real Sheila develops another persona, Jennifer Mitchell, by wearing a fake nose, wig, and speaking in a British accent. She allies with [[The Young and the Restless characters (2000s)#Tom Fisher|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), who helps her in her scheme to poison Lauren with a necklace that Scott offers to his mother as a gift. In exchange, Tom has Sheila manipulate his estranged wife [[Gloria Abbott Bardwell|Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) into giving him money and later bailing him out of prison.

When Lauren plans a rooftop dinner with her fiancé [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), Sheila surprises her and persuades her to commit suicide by jumping off of the roof. Lauren believes Sheila is a hallucination, but before she can jump, Michael rescues her. At the hospital, Sheila sneaks into Lauren's room as &quot;Jennifer,&quot; and attempts to inject the poison into Lauren's bloodstream, but is interrupted. She then convinces Tom — Michael's stepfather — to help her abduct Lauren from a yacht while on her honeymoon with Michael. She then bombs the yacht, hoping to kill both Lauren and Tom, whom she wants to take the fall for the crime.  Tom realizes Sheila's plan, and traps both Sheila and Lauren in a bomb shelter.  Tom leaves the two together and in the meantime is shot and killed by [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] ([[Jerry Douglas]]). As the bomb shelter collapses, Lauren is astonished when Sheila saves her life. Sheila escapes on her own and is last seen in an unidentified plastic surgeon's office asking for a new face.

It was revealed later that year that Paul Williams had been hiding the fact that Sheila—who had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman]]—was still alive, and that he had been keeping her locked in a cage she had constructed in an abandoned warehouse. However, Sheila was determined to escape and take Phyllis's place in order to infiltrate Michael and Lauren's lives. Sheila was accidentally freed from the prison she created for Lauren by Maggie Sullivan. After acting as a kidnap victim and pleading for Maggie's help, Maggie set her free but before Sheila left, she shot her. Maggie recovered, though nearly died.

Subsequently, Paul returned to the warehouse only to be ambushed by Sheila, who imprisoned both Paul and Maggie in the cell. Sheila and Phyllis then had a face to face encounter. After overpowering Phyllis, Sheila lured an unsuspecting Lauren and her baby Fenmore into her clutches; she then fled with Phyllis and the babies as hostages, after subduing Lauren. By this time Michael had arrived at the warehouse and freed Paul and Maggie, the latter being taken to the hospital after that.

Posing as an elderly woman named Betsy, Sheila took Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby retirement home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren went to the home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren found Sheila's apartment and forced her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argued over who was who, and Lauren screamed at them to stop. Sheila then ran to grab baby Summer to use her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis told Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turned to Sheila and shot her. Sheila was then declared dead at the scene. An autopsy revealed it was indeed Sheila Carter.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-young-and-restless/ep-8576-975653/ |title=Ep. #8576 |publisher=''TV.com'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Y&amp;R Transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvmegasite.net/transcripts/yr/older/2010/yr-trans-01-08-10.shtml |title=Ep. #8576 |publisher=''tvmegasite.net'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010–2012===
In 2010, Sarah Smythe, Sheila Carter's sister, stated a number of times that Sheila did have surgery to look like Phyllis. Herself having had plastic surgery to resemble Lauren, Sarah held both Phyllis and Lauren responsible for her sister's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y&amp;R - Transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvmegasite.net/transcripts/yr/older/2010/yr-trans-04-28-10.shtml |title=Episode # 9387|publisher=''tvmegasite.net'' |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Y&amp;R / Transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvmegasite.net/transcripts/yr/older/2012/yr-trans-02-23-12.shtml |title=Episode # 9850|publisher=''tvmegasite.net'' |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah devised a plan with [[Daisy Carter]] and [[Ryder Callahan]], Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher, to take over Lauren's life and riches. The plan failed and Lauren ended up shooting and killing Sarah in self-defense as Sarah tried to fire her gun at Phyllis. In late 2012, a woman claiming to be Daisy's mother checked her out of a mental institution signing the name &quot;Sheila Carter&quot; on the release form.

==Critical reception==
Sheila is often considered to be one of the most popular villains in daytime,&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 10 Soap Opera Villains of All Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.about.com/od/showoverviews/tp/Top-10-Soap-Opera-Villains-Of-All-Time.htm |title=Top 10 Soap Opera Villains of All Time|publisher=''soaps.about.com'' |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/slideshow/2013/06/15/soap-opera-villains-bad-guys-daytime-emmys |title=Soap opera slimeballs:  The best villains|publisher=''www.hlntv.com'' |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but storylines from late 2006 and onward were not well received by many viewers and fans for a number of reasons. Some viewers do not believe the woman that had plastic surgery to look like Phyllis was actually Sheila Carter. They either believe that woman was Sugar (even though she was in GC when Sheila was at that surgeon's in South America) or some other accomplice Sheila had enrolled. Many of them also refuse to believe Sarah Smythe (who could have been a paternal half-sister using her married name) was ever Sheila Carter's sister or that Daisy Carter &amp; Ryder Callahan were ever Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruined Romance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaptownusa.com/colonnade30Oct.html |title=How the threat of plastic surgery-altered characters ruined a perfectly good romance|publisher=''soaptownusa.com'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/04/13/the-young-and-the-restless-takes-a-bizarro-turn/ |title=The Young and the Restless Takes A Bizarro Turn|publisher=''aoltv.com'' |accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Theodore Cartman''', often referred to as just '''Cartman''', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s02e11-roger-ebert-should-lay-off-the-fatty-foods|title=Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods|date=2 Feb 1998|accessdate=6 June 2011}}@ 13:00&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the main characters in the [[Cartoon series|animated]] [[Television program#North American usage|television series]] ''[[South Park]]'', created by [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], and voiced by Trey Parker. Cartman, generally referred to by his surname, is one of four central characters in ''South Park'', along with his friends [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Kenny McCormick]]. Cartman first appeared, originally named Kenny, in prototypical form in a 1992 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Frosty|Jesus vs. Frosty]]'', and a 1995 animated short ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)#Jesus vs. Santa|Jesus vs. Santa]]'', and first appeared on television in the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''South Park'', &quot;[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]&quot;, on August 13, 1997.

Cartman is an [[elementary school]] student who lives with his mother in the fictional town of South Park, [[Colorado]], where he routinely has extraordinary experiences atypical of a small town. Cartman has been portrayed as [[aggression|aggressive]], [[prejudice]]d, [[Pride|arrogant]], and [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] since his character's inception; Stone and Parker describe the character as &quot;a little [[Archie Bunker]]&quot;. These traits are significantly augmented in later seasons as his character evolves, and he begins to exhibit extremely [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Sociopathic personality disorder|sociopathic]] and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behavior, and also be depicted as highly [[intelligence|intelligent]], able to execute morally appalling plans and business ideas with success.

Cartman is considered to be the most popular character on ''South Park''.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695 | title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&amp;*% | work=[[NPR]] | date=April 5, 2008 | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=Rovner, Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-cartman-moments.html | title=Top 10: Cartman Moments | work=[[AskMen]] | accessdate=July 22, 2013 | author=McKee, Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN top&quot;/&gt; Parker and Stone state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most identify. ''South Park'' has received both praise and criticism for Cartman's [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] behavior. Prominent publications and television channels have included Cartman on their lists as one of the most iconic television and cartoon characters of all time.

==Role in ''South Park''==
Eric Cartman attends South Park Elementary as part of [[Mr. Garrison]]'s class. During the show's first 58 episodes, Cartman and the other main characters are in the [[third grade]], after which they move on to the [[fourth grade]]. He is an [[only child]] being raised by [[Liane Cartman]], a promiscuous single mother. In &quot;[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]&quot; (1998), Liane Cartman claims to be a [[hermaphrodite]] when she also claims to be the father of Cartman and that she did not know the woman who gave birth to Cartman.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfarland1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first = Melanie | last = McFarland| title= Oh my God, 'South Park' killed a decade!| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date= 2006-09-30|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287052_southpark02.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[South Park (season 14)|season 14]] (2010) episode &quot;[[201 (South Park)|201]]&quot; later reveals that Liane actually is his mother, and that his true biological father is Jack Tenorman, a [[fictional]] former player for the [[Denver Broncos]] whom Cartman arranged to be killed in the [[South Park (season 5)|season five]] (2001) episode &quot;[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]&quot;, making Cartman and Scott Tenorman half-brothers and putting Liane's intersexual identity in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;cartmandad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/201,40382/|title=201|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|date=21 April 2010|work=The A.V.

Among the show's main child characters, Cartman is distinguished as &quot;the fat kid&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Jaime J. Weinman |title=South Park grows up |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20080312_115131_115131&amp;page=2 |accessdate=2008-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802210052/http://www.macleans.ca:80/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20080312_115131_115131&amp;page=2 |archivedate=2009-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his obesity is a continuing subject of insults and ridicule from other characters throughout the show's run.&lt;ref name=&quot;islam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Ali Asadullah |title=Contemporary Cartoon Conjures Racist Past |publisher=IslamOnline.net |date=2001-11-15 |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658390218&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317003250/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658390218&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman is frequently portrayed as an antagonist or villain whose actions set in motion the events serving as the main plot of an episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; Other children and classmates are alienated by Cartman's insensitive, [[racist]], [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]], [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]], [[Laziness|lazy]], self-righteous behavior,&lt;ref name=&quot;groce&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Groce |title=Entertainment and wartime make strange bedfellows |work=[[The Johns Hopkins News-Letter]] |date=2003-04-18 |url=http://www.jhunewsletter.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=6df86a6b-d16e-4132-8018-ab8e298474bf |accessdate=2009-05-09 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lowbrow&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Dennis Lim | title = Television: Lowbrow and proud of it | publisher = independent.co.uk| date = 1998-03-29| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-lowbrow-and-proud-of-it-1153256.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lear&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Jesse McKinley | title = Norman Lear Discovers Soul Mates in 'South Park' | work = The New York Times| date = 2003-04-10| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/movies/norman-lear-discovers-soul-mates-in-south-park.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asullivan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Andrew Sullivan]] | title = South Park and Imus | work = [[The Atlantic]]| date = 2007-04-13| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/movies/norman-lear-discovers-soul-mates-in-south-park.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;philo&quot;&gt;Arp and Miller, pp.177–88&lt;/ref&gt; but are occasionally influenced by his obtrusive, manipulative, and propagandist antics.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo2&quot;&gt;Arp and Johnson, pp. 213–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyle, who is [[Judaism|Jewish]], is often the target of Cartman's [[slander]] and [[anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] insults. The two have shared an enmity since the show's beginnings, and their rivalry has become significantly more pronounced as the series has progressed, with Cartman even routinely exposing Kyle to physical endangerment.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIDS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/859/859352p1.html|title=&quot;Tonsil Trouble&quot; Review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=Oct 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle has intentionally endangered Cartman as well by convincing him in &quot;[[Fatbeard]]&quot; to go to Somalia in hopes that he will be killed. However, at other times, Kyle is an enthusiastic participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually being nice to Kyle in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Wing (South Park)]]'', ''[[Crack Baby Athletic Association]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by [[Archie Bunker]] and [[Michael Stivic|Michael &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic]] on the 1970s [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]''. Kyle has a tendency to make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation in this regard is not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode &quot;[[Imaginationland: The Movie|Imaginationland]]&quot; ([[South Park (season 11)|season 11]], 2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;/&gt; This obsession has also proven itself to actually trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in &quot;[[Christian Rock Hard]]&quot; Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a platinum album before Kyle can. After recruiting Butters and Token, Cartman creates a Christian rock band called &quot;Faith+1&quot; and &quot;writes&quot; Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as &quot;baby&quot; with &quot;Jesus&quot; (which humorously implicates sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large fan base as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the &quot;Myrrh&quot; album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an Anti-Christian rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. In &quot;[[You're Getting Old]]&quot;, the final episode of the first half of South Park's 15th season, it is suggested that Kyle and Cartman may be developing a genuine friendship, possibly due to the void left by Stan's apparent departure. Cartman's resentment of Stan is usually reserved for when Cartman proudly proclaims his hatred for both Stan and Kyle as a duo, and his contempt for Stan as an individual is usually limited to his annoyance with Stan's sensitivity, affection for animals, and the relationship Stan shares with Wendy.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo3&quot;&gt;Arp and Jacoby, pp. 58–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being intolerant of other cultures, Cartman displays an aptitude for learning foreign languages. In the episode &quot;[[My Future Self n' Me]]&quot; when he starts &quot;Parental Revenge Corp&quot;, he speaks Spanish to his Latino workers, though he may have learned the language merely from a practical standpoint in order to better exploit a labor pool. He also knows German, and once spoke a few phrases while dressed up as [[Adolf Hitler]] while promoting the extermination of Jews to an oblivious audience that did not speak German. Cartman can also be seen speaking broken German with an American accent in Season 15 Episode 2 &quot;[[Funnybot]]&quot;. Conversely in one episode (&quot;[[Major Boobage]]&quot;) Cartman acts as an [[Oskar Schindler]] character for the town's cats, a rare case of a subplot based on Cartman's altruism.

Cartman frequently teases Kenny for being poor, and derides Kenny's family for being on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sfrubin&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author = Sylvia Rubin | title = TV 's Foul-Mouthed Funnies| work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date = 1998-01-26| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/01/26/DD58819.DTL| accessdate = 2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will also use an awkward pause during a conversation as an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bullzeye&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author = Jamey Codding| title = Bullz-Eye's All-Time Best Cartoon Characters | publisher = Bullz-Eye.com |date = 2006-01-28| url= http://www.bullz-eye.com/entertainment/features/2006/best_cartoon_characters.htm| accessdate = 2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman's mischievous treatment of [[Butters Stotch]], and the relationship the duo shares has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;/&gt; This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;buttersfave&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Dudley Price| title = Butters one of 'South Park' creator Trey Parker's favorite characters.| publisher = [[The America's Intelligence Wire]] | date = 2003-12-18| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19761309_ITM | accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several episodes center around Cartman's greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, although his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; His extreme disdain for [[hippie]]s serves to satirize the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and its influence in contemporary society,&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot;/&gt; reflecting Parker's real-life antipathy towards hippies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|title=An interview with Matt Stone|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.southparkstudios.com/|accessdate=2009-02-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061433/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=25|archivedate=2008-12-19|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with &quot;You know, I've learned something today...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html |title=List of &quot;I've learned something today&quot; quotes including relevant episode citations |accessdate=2009-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627134449/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu:80/~smaji/southpark.html |archivedate=2009-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

===Creation and design===
[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cartman is voiced by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]].]]
A precursor to Cartman first appeared in the first ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. In the short, Cartman was actually named &quot;Kenny&quot;, and the catchphrase &quot;Oh my God, they killed Kenny!&quot; was exclaimed when the character representing Cartman was killed by an evil snowman. The character was composed of [[construction paper]] cutouts and animated through the use of [[stop motion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Matt Cheplic | title = 'As Crappy As Possible': The Method Behind the Madness of South Park | publisher = [[Penton Media]] | date = 1998-05-01 | url = http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/news-articles/crappy-possible-method-behind-madness-south-park/382927/ | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When commissioned three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a [[video]] [[Christmas card]] that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Santa''.&lt;ref name=&quot;VH1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/press/bios/brian_graden.jhtml|title=Brian Graden's Bio|publisher=VH1.com|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NotableBiographies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Graden-Brian.html|title=Brian Graden Biography|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this short, his character first appears as he does in the series, and is given the name &quot;Cartman&quot;, while the character of Kenny appears as the character is depicted today and given Cartman's moniker from the previous short. Cartman next appeared on August 13, 1997, when ''South Park'' debuted on [[Comedy Central]] with the episode &quot;[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]&quot;.

In keeping with the show's [[Cutout animation|animation style]], Cartman is composed of simple geometrical shapes and [[primary color]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Abbie Bernstein |title=South Park – Volume 2 |publisher=AVRev.com |date=1998-10-27 |url=http://www.avrev.com/dvd-movie-disc-reviews/tv-shows/south-park-volume-2.html |accessdate=2008-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515045446/http://www.avrev.com/dvd-movie-disc-reviews/tv-shows/south-park-volume-2.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from one direction, and his movements intentionally jerky.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avr&quot;/&gt; Ever since the show's second episode, &quot;[[Weight Gain 4000]]&quot; ([[South Park (season 1)|season one]], 1997), Cartman, like all other characters on the show, has been animated with computer software, though he is portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes its original technique.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;

Cartman is usually depicted wearing winter attire which consists of a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise [[knit cap]] tapered with a yellow [[pom-pom]]. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape in contrast to the circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.

Although he had originally voiced Cartman without any computer manipulation, Parker now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range with a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is then edited with [[Pro Tools]], and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound like that of a fourth grader.&lt;ref name=&quot;digizine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Jorgl |title=South Park: Where The Sound Ain't No Joke! |publisher=Digizine |year=2005 |url=http://www2.digidesign.com/digizine/dz_Q105/features/cover_story/index.cfm?pagenum=2 |archive-url=http://archive.is/20131130070727/http://www2.digidesign.com/digizine/dz_Q105/features/cover_story/index.cfm?pagenum=2 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-30 |accessdate=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = South Park FAQ |url = http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=2&amp;year=2009| date = 2009-02-10 | publisher = South Park Studios | accessdate = 2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sps40&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Questions |url=http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm |date=2001-10-04 |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129004417/http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker says to achieve the effect of Cartman's voice, he simply uses the same technique when voicing Stan while &quot;adding a lot of fat to it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yahoo!

===Development===
Cartman is partially named after and based on Matt Karpman, a high school classmate of Parker who remains a friend of both Parker and Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=11264|title=FAQ Archives| accessdate= 2009-05-09|publisher=South Park Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman is also inspired by ''[[All in the Family]]'' patriarch [[Archie Bunker]], who is himself inspired by [[Alf Garnett]] from ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'', the original British version of ''All in the Family''. Parker and Stone are big fans of ''All in the Family''. They state that creating Cartman as a &quot;little eight-year-old fat kid&quot; made it easier for the two to portray a Bunker-like character after the introduction of [[political correctness]] to late-20th century television.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89375695 |title=Eric Cartman: America's Favorite Little $@#&amp;*% |accessdate=2008-10-25 |last=Rovner |first=Julie |date=2008-04-05 |work=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12881 |title=Matt Stone, Trey Parker, Larry Divney 'Speaking Freely' transcript |accessdate=2007-02-08 |date=2002-03-01 |subject=Trey Parker |subject2=Matt Stone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mq7vTf06?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstamendmentcenter.org%2Fabout.aspx%3Fid%3D12881 |archivedate=2010-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While developing the character, Parker noted that everyone either remembers &quot;an annoying fat kid in their pasts&quot;, or &quot;they were the annoying fat kid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yahoo!

Cartman is foul-mouthed (as are his friends) as a means for Parker and Stone to portray how they believe young boys really talk when they are alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;avr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc4&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Jake Trapper and Dan Morris| title=Secrets of 'South Park'| publisher=[[ABC News]]| date=2006-09-22| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&amp;page=4| accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Parker, Cartman does not possess the &quot;underlying sweetness&quot; of the show's other child characters. Cartman is shown at times to be completely amoral and remorseless. Cartman is amused by bodily functions and [[toilet humor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins| title = Gross And Grosser | work = [[TIME]] | date = 1998-03-23 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028,00.html | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his favorite television personalities are [[Terrance and Phillip]], a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes.

Cartman is sensitive and in [[denial]] about his [[obesity]]. Often reasserting Liane's notion by exclaiming &quot;I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!&quot; and will just as often either threaten to bring harm to anyone who mocks his weight or curse them out in aggravation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; He has also had people killed, such as when he drove his psychiatrist's wife to suicide after enduring a long tirade about his weight. He views himself as more mature than his fellow friends and classmates, and often grows impatient with their company; despite claiming to be more mature, he will often break down crying childishly and pathetically whenever he feels defeated. This often leads to loud arguments, which in earlier seasons typically end with Cartman peevishly saying &quot;Screw you guys... I'm going home!&quot; and then leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; In an action [[King's College (Pennsylvania)|King's College]] [[philosophy]] professor David Kyle Johnson describes as &quot;directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or the unhappiness of others&quot;, Cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;philo2&quot;/&gt; The lack of a true father figure in his life, and Liane's promiscuity and drug use have caused repressed [[psychology|psychological]] hardship in Cartman's life.

Cartman thrives on achieving ascendancy over others,&lt;ref name=&quot;philo4&quot;&gt;Arp and White, pp. 66–76&lt;/ref&gt; and exerts his will by [[demagogy]] and by demanding that others &quot;Respect my authoritah!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR&quot;/&gt; Cartman has several times declared that his dream is getting &quot;Ten million dollars&quot;.

Cartman's anti-Semitism, while mostly limited to mocking Kyle, culminates in the [[South Park (season 8)|season eight]] (2004) episode &quot;[[The Passion of the Jew]]&quot;. In the episode, Cartman, after watching ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' numerous times, deifies the film's director, [[Mel Gibson]], and starts an official Gibson fan club, praising Gibson for &quot;trying to express—through cinema—the horror and filthiness of the common Jew&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gross&quot;&gt;{{cite news| author = Max Gross| title = ‘The Passion of the Christ’ Fuels Antisemitism—on ‘South Park’| work = [[The Jewish Daily Forward]]| date = 2004-04-09| url = http://www.forward.com/articles/5445/ | accessdate = 2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartman's interpretation of the film influences him to dress up as [[Adolf Hitler]] and lead other fan club members (who are oblivious of Cartman's actual intentions) in a failed effort to engage in a systematic [[genocide]] of the Jews similar to that of the [[Final Solution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gross&quot;/&gt; In the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] (2006) episode &quot;[[Smug Alert!]]&quot;, Cartman anonymously saves Kyle's life in an effort to get him and his family to return to South Park from [[San Francisco]], revealing that he craves the animosity shared between the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;smug&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Eric Goldman |title=TV Review: This week's target?

However, in the 16th-season episode &quot;[[Jewpacabra]]&quot; Cartman revealed he had converted to Judaism after a hallucinogenic dream. As of season 19, it is unsure whether he has retained this trait or whether it was simply a plot point in that one episode.

Upon hearing his classmates tell him that they hold him in the lowest regard possible and that they could not possibly think any worse of him, a stubborn Cartman misinterprets this act as their attempt to make him feel better, and convinces himself that everyone thinks he is the &quot;coolest kid in school&quot;. In the [[South Park (season 13)|season 13]] (2009) episode &quot;[[Fishsticks (South Park)|Fishsticks]]&quot;, Cartman subconsciously believes that he helped in creating a joke that quickly becomes a nationwide sensation, despite the fact that the character [[Jimmy Valmer]] writes the joke without any assistance. Carlos Delgado of ''If Magazine'' noted this as &quot;Cartman being so egotistical that he manipulates the past to serve his own purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=&quot;TV Review: South Park – Season 13 – &quot;Fishsticks&quot; |work=If Magazine |date=2009-04-09 |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=3168 |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015113520/http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=3168 |archivedate=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before season 20, little was shown concerning Cartman's romantic interests, as for the most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode (&quot;[[Chef Goes Nanners]]&quot;), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent from the end of episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.

Though he is commonly portrayed as having a chauvinist disrespect for foreign cultures, Cartman is shown at least twice (&quot;[[My Future Self n' Me]]&quot; and &quot;[[Pandemic (South Park)|Pandemic]]&quot;) to be able to speak fluent Spanish (and German).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s06e16-my-future-self-n-me|title=South Park Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain episodes, Cartman is shown to think of himself as a skilled fighter, only to be beat up by Wendy, Token, Stan, and Kyle at different times.  However, when Cartman thinks he has some sort of authority, such as being the Coon or the hallway monitor, he displays various martial arts knowledge and proves to be able to beat up various other characters such as Clyde and Bradley.

'''The Carver''' is a fictional character on the television show ''[[Nip/Tuck]].'' Introduced during the second season, he became the primary [[antagonist]] of the third season.

== Background ==
The Carver is introduced in the episode &quot;Naomi Gaines&quot; as a masked [[serial rape|serial rapist]] who [[Glasgow smile|disfigures]], [[rape]]s, and/or kills his victims, though he has killed only one victim: Rhea Reynolds, a woman who faked being attacked by the Carver so she could get free plastic surgery. He becomes upset after [[Sean McNamara (Nip/Tuck)|Dr. Sean McNamara]] performs corrective [[plastic surgery]] on one of his victims.  He attacks McNamara in his bathroom and cuts one side of his face. He then threatens to kill McNamara if he &quot;fixes&quot; any more of the Carver's &quot;masterpieces.&quot;  McNamara continues to do so, and in the second season cliffhanger, the Carver exacts revenge by attacking and raping Dr. Christian Troy, McNamara's associate. Before raping his victims, and/or carving their cheeks down to the lip to resemble a smile (a &quot;[[Glasgow smile]]&quot;), the Carver tells his victims, &quot;Beauty is a curse on the world,&quot; sometimes adding, &quot;It keeps us from seeing who the real monsters are.&quot;

==Motives ==
The Carver apparently believes that [[Physical attractiveness|physical beauty]] is [[evil]] and feels compelled to destroy it.  He has referred to beauty as a type of prison or cage that people are trapped in and believes it necessary to free such a craftsman's pride in his or her work. He also considers his resulting disfigurements &quot;art&quot; – a new kind of beauty to grace the world.

Detective Kit McGraw brings Dr. Quentin Costa in for questioning, suspecting him to be the Carver; she subsequently finds that, due to a medical condition, Costa was born with no [[human penis|penis]].  Since all of the Carver's victims were raped, Costa is released.

The Carver attacks a group of nine [[sorority]] girls. During questioning, one victim recounts walking in on the Carver raping her sorority sister, and was able to see that the Carver did not have a real penis, but rather was wearing a strap-on [[dildo]].

Kit and the police storm Costa's apartment only to find Costa tied to his bed, bearing the trademark cheek slashes of The Carver, and the message &quot;I can't stop&quot; written in blood on the wall behind him.

Once again exonerated from the suspect pool, Costa asks Christian and Sean to repair his face. After initially refusing, Christian and Sean agree to perform the surgery. During this conversation, Costa explains away some potential [[plot hole]]s from earlier in the season.  Specifically:

* When Sean witnessed Costa receiving [[oral sex]] at a college party, Costa explains how he paid the girl $100 to pretend to perform fellatio on him.
* When Costa was beginning to have 4-way sex with Christian, Kit and Kimber, he intentionally grabbed Christian's buttocks so he could end the session early and thus retain his secret.

During Costa's operation, Kit arrives with a [[S.W.A.T.]] team and arrests [[Liz Cruz (Nip/Tuck)|Liz Cruz]], McNamara/Troy's [[anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]], as the next prime suspect. During the interrogation, Kit explains the [[evidence]] against Liz:
* A [[search warrant]] of Liz's house led to the discovery of a strap-on dildo.
* A receipt for an order of the same drugs the Carver uses on his victims was found at McNamara/Troy with Liz's signature on it.
* Liz has been visiting numerous area [[spermatozoon|sperm]] banks and therefore could have obtained Christian's sperm and planted evidence that led to Christian's arrest as a suspect earlier in the season (it is known by the viewers that Liz received a sample directly from Christian in Season 2, but not mentioned by Kit). Liz attests her innocence during questioning.

Sean checks up on Quentin in recovery. Gina, carved but not dead, is the body in Quentin's bed — seen only by the audience. The Carver suddenly appears behind Sean, injects him with the paralyzing agent and unmasks — revealing himself to be none other than Quentin Costa.

Sean awakens to find both Christian and himself tied to separate operating tables. Costa cuts off Sean's pinky finger and attempts to force Christian to cut off his own hand. Just before Christian is about to do it, Kit arrives and shoots Costa in the back.  Kit tells paramedics to make sure the [[autopsy]] on Costa's body is not started without her.

At police headquarters, Kit explains to Christian and Sean that Gina (who was at the office to drop off a [[Christmas]] gift for Christian) called [[9-1-1]], which is why Kit showed up.  Kit then explains Quentin's life story.

Costa was born with [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], a debilitating disease that left him with no penis. He also had a sister, Violet, who suffered severe facial disfigurement. Apparently both medical anomalies were a result of [[incest]]. After their parents abandoned them, the two lived in a [[convent]] in [[Maine]].  Quentin worked his whole life to become a [[plastic surgeon]] so he could fix his sister's face, but she died at the age of 29 during her final operation.

Kit leaves [[Miami]] after closing the case. While talking to Gina, Sean and Christian discover that Gina never called 911, as she was completely paralyzed after being attacked by the Carver.

In the [[morgue]], we see a body laid out covered by a sheet. A hand removes the sheet to reveal Quentin Costa, who opens his eyes and sits up, revealing a bullet-proof vest beneath his black suit. &quot;What took so long?&quot; asks Costa.

Christian and Sean take a [[Red-eye flight]] to Maine to visit the convent where Costa was raised. When they mention Violet's death, the Mother Superior is confused, explaining that Quentin's sister's name isn't Violet, it is Katherine; but Quentin always called her Kit. The Mother Superior then shows Sean and Christian a Christmas card that the pair sent her three years before, which includes a photo of Quentin and Kit.

The Carver storyline ends with Quentin and Kit relaxing at a luxury hotel in [[Málaga]]. Although Kit wants to take a brief vacation, Quentin is spurred on by the sight of a woman with [[breast implant]]s. The scene ends with a shot of the woman lying in a deck chair with Quentin and Kit's shadows hovering over her.

=== Correct guesses and a premature reveal===

Prior to the finale, a few fans were able to correctly guess the identity of the Carver through the use of sound-editing programs.  As a promotion for the show, FX set up a profile for the Carver on [[myspace.com]], which included videos of the Carver espousing his philosophy.  Within days, various tech-savvy audiophiles took the audio from these videos, filtered out the distortion from the Carver's voice synthesizer, and were able to reveal that at the very least, Campos was voicing The Carver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecarver.ytmnsfw.com/ YTMND - The Carver is revealed!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carver's identity was also leaked prematurely by none other than [[FX Networks]]. One day before the finale episode aired, the press section of the FX Networks website published three pictures which revealed the identity of the Carver. While the pictures were removed from the site later that evening, they had already been re-published on various fan-based message boards.

==Behind the scenes==

*The Carver's outfit is made by [[Prada]]. His top is a black zip-up sweater from the Winter 2004 collection.
* Three knives were used for filming: A sharp, shiny one used for scenes in which the Carver is just brandishing the knife; a dull one for when the Carver &quot;slashes&quot;; and a dull one with a built in blood tube to create a bleeding effect when the knife is pressed against skin (this prop was used in the Season 2 episode in which Sean is carved).
* There was only one Carver mask, custom molded from [[porcelain]] and [[resin]]. Because it was so fragile, a props manager was in charge of making sure it was handled properly every time it was on the set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-12-19-niptuck_x.htm USATODAY.com - Unmasking 'Nip/Tuck' devil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bruno Campos wore brown [[contact lens]]es when playing the Carver to keep his blue eyes from being seen in the mask.
* [[Joely Richardson]] lost a $100 bet to Campos over the Carver's identity. Apparently, she couldn't believe it would be him.  He claims to have framed the cheque.

==Real-life similarities==
*The Carver's [[modus operandi]] is somewhat similar to the [[urban legend]] of the Smiley Gang, a group of six men who offered their victims the choice of being raped or having an &quot;[[Glasgow smile|eternal smile]]&quot; cut into their faces. This [[hoax]], predominantly spread by [[email]], spread fear among teens and their parents in both the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblog.roelonline.net/archives/001016.php Roel's Weblog - Gerucht over 'smiley-bende' houdt politie bezig&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference is that the Carver offered his victims no choice; he both cut and raped them.

'''Tyrone Cash''' is a fictional character in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. He is a member of [[The Ultimates]] and is described as being the first [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] before [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]] became the Hulk.&lt;ref name=&quot;UC:A8&quot;&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Tyrone Cash first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' Vol. 2 #1 and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Leinil Francis Yu]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, '''Dr. Leonard Williams''' was a [[professor]] at [[Cambridge University]] and a family man with a wife and children but due to disability he relied on the aid of crutches to walk. Cambridge is where he worked with a young [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]. They worked together in order to create a super soldier formula. During this time, he became Bruce's &quot;mentor&quot; and allegedly taught Banner &quot;everything he knows.&quot; Williams disappears in an unexplained occurrence in which several people are killed, and comes to be considered a missing person.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Williams became the first Hulk and lives as &quot;Tyrone Cash.&quot; Unlike the Bruce Banner's Hulk, Tyrone Cash still retains his intellect and self-control. The years he was &quot;missing,&quot; he was actually being monitored by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while he was &quot;murdering and pillaging his way through [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].&quot; Now 16 years after the accident Leonard Williams &quot;perished&quot; in, Tyrone Cash resides in [[South America]] living as a ruthless gang leader. In order to draft Williams/Cash into the Avengers black ops team, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] sends [[War Machine]] to retrieve him. War Machine approaches Cash peacefully, and tries to remind him of his previous life, but Cash turns on him, and starts brutally beating War Machine. During their fight, Cash shows how powerful he is and how truly sadistic and ruthless he has become. He plucks a one-man plane from the air and uses it as a weapon, with no remorse for killing the pilot or the others on his island. He threatens to quickly rebuild his &quot;crime empire&quot; if War Machine ruins it, and only stops fighting after War Machine says &quot;We'll tell your wife and kid you're still alive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UC:A8&quot;/&gt;

The first assignment given to Cash and his fellow Avengers is to take out the enigmatic and deadly [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)#Ultimate Marvel|Ghost Rider]]. In an attempt to &quot;get the jump on&quot; Ghost Rider the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents stand guard at an airport. Ghost Rider eventually arrives to capture, and inevitably kill, his target. Ghost Rider ripped a man from his plane and quickly rides off, but his escape is cut short by a well placed rocket courtesy of [[Hawkeye (comics)#Other versions|Hawkeye]].

Cash is discovered to be behind the sale of S.H.I.E.L.D.-owned Super-Soldiers on the black market. After the Avengers attempt to take him down and arrest him, he confesses that he was secretly taking orders from [[Carol Danvers]], and that she has been selling S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets for years.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

He is taken down by [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], who hypnotizes him and drains his Hulk-blood out of him. Upon being brought to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Tyrone Cash tells Nick Fury the secrets of the Hulk drug and is then killed by Nick Fury.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Tyrone Cash has [[superhuman strength]], stamina and durability, and a [[healing factor]] which are similar to those abilities possessed by the Hulk. Tyrone also possesses genius-level intellect.

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, an alternate version of Leonard Williams appears as a member of the Thor Corps on [[Battleworld]]. He is seen with Thor versions of [[Gamora]], Kit Renner, and other unknown Thor Corps members where they pin down the Banshee Squadron when they landed upon leaving Hala Field in their aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Helena allegedly died on camera of natural causes in November 2015, Towers would return on several occasions in 2016, first for a videotaped will reading, then as part of several character's nightmares.

== Storylines ==
===1980s===
[[File:John Colicos.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Colicos]] portrayed [[Mikkos Cassadine]], Helena's husband whose death at the hands of [[Luke and Laura]] would ignite a nearly 4 decade long feud.]]
In Summer 1981, [[Luke Spencer|Luke]], [[Laura Webber|Laura]], and [[Robert Scorpio]] foil Mikkos Cassadine's plot to freeze the world using a weather machine, and both Mikkos and his brother [[Tony Cassadine|Tony]] are killed while their other brother [[Victor Cassadine|Victor]] is arrested. Mikkos's widow Helena appears in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] just in time to curse Luke and Laura from the sidelines of their November 16, 1981 wedding. Laura later vanishes without a trace in 1982, leaving a devastated Luke to search for her. Presumed dead, Laura reappears in 1983, having been kidnapped by the Cassadines in revenge. Told that Luke was dead, Laura had been forced to marry Mikkos and Helena's son [[Stavros Cassadine]], who had fallen in love with her. She had returned to Port Charles upon learning that Luke was alive, followed by Stavros; he is ultimately killed, and Luke and Laura are reunited. Discovering that Laura is pregnant with their first child, she and Luke leave town in 1984.

===1990s===
Having returned to Port Charles in 1993 with son [[Lucky Spencer|Lucky]], Luke and Laura have a daughter they call [[Lulu Spencer|Lulu]] in 1994.  In 1996 she is diagnosed with [[aplastic anemia]]. A mysterious young man comes to town hoping to help. Laura is forced to reveal that he is [[Nikolas Cassadine]], her son with Stavros, born during her captivity. She had been sworn by the Cassadines to leave him behind and keep his existence a secret as a condition of her release, to protect Luke from their wrath. Nikolas saves Lulu's life with a [[bone marrow transplant]], but Luke and Laura's marriage is destroyed by the revelation of this secret. Around this time, Luke visits a bedridden Helena, gloating at her condition but vowing to have his revenge when she is well enough to fully experience him murdering her. Nikolas had come to town with his calculating but benevolent uncle and guardian [[Stefan Cassadine]] (Mikkos and Helena's younger son) and Stefan's adopted cousin [[Alexis Davis]]. Stefan and Laura had been romantically involved while she had been married to Stavros and confined on Cassadine Island. Stefan still harbors feelings for her. With Laura's marriage to Luke faltering, her own feelings for Stefan are rekindled as he comforts her. With Helena no longer a threat, Stefan discovers one of her secrets: Laura's mother Lesley is alive, having been kidnapped by Helena in 1984 and her death faked. Stefan frees Lesley and reunites her with Laura.

Helena appears in 1997 in an attempt to reassert control over Cassadine heir Nikolas and his fortune. She loathes Stefan, whom she views as weak, and seeks to thwart his influence over Nikolas by distracting Stefan with Laura. Meanwhile, Alexis had discovered she was actually Mikkos' illegitimate daughter. Helena terrorizes her. Alexis remembers - as a little girl she had watched Helena slit her mother's throat. Luke and Alexis plot to kill Helena in 1998, but Stefan's fiancée [[Katherine Bell (General Hospital)|Katherine Bell]] is accidentally killed instead. They attempt to frame Helena, but Stefan is arrested; Katherine is revealed to be alive, saved by Helena as part of her plans. In Helena's debt, Katherine seduces Nikolas to put a wedge between him and Stefan. Meanwhile, Luke discovers evidence Nikolas is actually Stefan's son, making him no longer the Cassadine heir and allowing Helena to take control of the Cassadine fortune. She next plans to eliminate Stefan and Laura, but Stefan manages to poison Helena, rendering her paralyzed and mute. Katherine is murdered for real. Laura is charged; it is ultimately revealed an antidote had allowed Helena to recover. She had crept out of her bed to kill Katherine and frame Laura. Later it is also discovered Helena had faked the DNA results. Nikolas is Stavros' son and the rightful heir.

===2000s===
Lucky is presumed dead in a fire in May 1999; he reappears in February 2000 having been kidnapped on Helena's orders and brainwashed into serving her. In 2001, it is revealed Stavros has been in cryonic suspension in a secret room below General Hospital since his apparent &quot;death&quot; in 1983, waiting for a time when medical science could revive him. Helena manages to do so. Stefan stirs up trouble in town. Though initially compelled to do Helena's bidding and even hurting his loved ones, Lucky finally manages to break Helena's conditioning. Luke kills Stavros again by pushing him into a bottomless pit in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''General Hospital'' was beginning to unfold a plot involving [[bioterrorism]], with Stavros and Helena as the primary antagonists.  However, following the terrorist attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the producers quickly altered the storyline. Stavros was written out of the series.

In 2006 Helena placed a nanny in Nikolas' home, [[Colleen McHenry]], in hopes of getting Nikolas' son [[Spencer Cassadine|Spencer]]. For a while, everything was going according to plan, until Colleen turned on Helena with her own agenda. She had fallen for Nikolas. When her feelings weren't returned because Nikolas and Emily had gotten back together, she lost it. Colleen overpowered Helena and held her captive in a tower near Wyndemere for a couple days. She then kidnapped baby Spencer on [[Christmas Eve]]. Nikolas and Emily searched for them and tracked Colleen to [[Chicago]] where she had dyed her hair and gotten a job at a daycare center to save enough and start a new life with &quot;her son&quot;. After a few near-misses with Nikolas and Emily, Helena encountered the psycho nanny and took Spencer to [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Nik &amp; Em followed her and got there just in time to stop Helena from baptizing Spencer with a different name. When they tried to get him back, Helena threatened to kill him with a dagger. Emily offered to trade herself for the infant. Helena accepted. Emily was able to get away, as was Helena.

Helena reappears in Port Charles at the General Hospital grand re-opening on April 13, 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-04-13&quot;/&gt; demanding Nikolas return a painting of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus|Saint Gregoire]] to her,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-06-16&quot;&gt;[http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/update/6446/Rebecca_Stands_Up_To_Helena ''General Hospital'' recap (6/16/09) - Soaps.com]&lt;/ref&gt; which he does.

She returns again on June 4, 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-06-04&quot;/&gt; and soon tries to lure Rebecca away from her &quot;current partner&quot; and assist in Helena's plans; Rebecca angrily refuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soaps.com 2009-06-05&quot;&gt;[http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/update/6736/Didnt_See_That_One_Coming ''General Hospital'' recap (6/5/09) - Soaps.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After their conversation, Helena disappears.

On September 30, 2009, Helena returns, but she is sick and confined to her bed. Luke comes in and talks to her. Helena tells him another Cassadine is plotting revenge on the Spencers and Cassadines. Luke thinks Helena is faking her illness but he feels her forehead. It is revealed she is not faking her illness. Her nurse Mischa tells Luke's kids Ethan and Lulu there is another Cassadine, named Valentin, whom even Helena fears. Fearing for her life, Nikolas has Helena flown to [[General Hospital]]. After stirring up even more trouble after arriving in [[Port Charles]], Nikolas uses his position in the hospital's board of directors to have Helena sent back to [[Greece]].

===2010s===
Helena showed up in Port Charles again on February 10, following her learning of Nikolas' affair with [[Elizabeth Webber]].  The following day, Elizabeth finds out she is pregnant.  Believing the baby is Nikolas's, Helena made immediate threats to Elizabeth about the welfare of the child. Believing she is unstable, Nikolas and Lucky pressure her into committing herself into [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Shadybrook Sanitarium]]. In an attempt to keep tabs on Elizabeth, Helena makes a large donation to the institution, getting an upperhand with the staff. While reminiscing with Luke, she reveals the immediate threat from Valentin has passed. Later, when Elizabeth has a paternity test done, Helena pays the lab tech to let her see the results first. She finds out Lucky is the biological father, but has the results switched to make it look like Nikolas is the father. Helena has her Man kidnap Tracy who she thought knew Liz's baby was a Spencer. Luke tries to find Tracy but ends up kidnapped, too. While they are being held hostage, Tracy becomes sick and Luke takes care of her. Later Nikolas and Lucky find Tracy and Luke. Upon returning to Port Charles, Nikolas banishes Helena from Wyndemere for her actions and warns her to stay away from Elizabeth and their son. When the newborn Aiden is later kidnapped, Helena instantly becomes a suspect, and Nik openly threatens to kill her if she is the one who did so.  Eventually, Aiden is found unharmed.

Over time, Elizabeth suspects that Aiden is Lucky's son, not Nikolas', and confirms this with a third DNA test.  After delaying this revelation when Elizabeth's middle child Jake is killed in a hit-and run accident, she finally reveals the truth to Lucky and Nikolas.  Nikolas does not take the news well, and decides to leave Aiden with Elizabeth and Lucky, then prepares to leave town. Helena is seen in Port Charles secretly watching Nikolas as he boards his jet.  Shortly afterward, she confronts Lucky to taunt him, while insisting the whole time that Aiden was really a Cassadine and that Elizabeth's third DNA test was the tampered one.  Lucky demands her to leave.

While searching from a recently missing-in-action Luke in Florida, Lulu and her boyfriend [[Dante Falconeri|Dante]] learn from a pimp that Luke is somewhere doing business with Helena. The two arrive on Cassadine Island where they confront Helena about Luke's whereabouts. Helena later threatens to cause the [[Spencer family (General Hospital)|Spencer family]] pain by making them lose Luke. Helena has a plan to get revenge on Spencers for the deaths of both her sons.

On September 28, 2011, Luke's son, Ethan, is wandering in Nik's home. While there, he finds a photo of Laura and is smacked in the head with vase by Helena. Helena sees someone passing by while she and Ethan talk.

On January 11, 2012, Helena is seen lurking the tunnels of Wyndemere holding a dagger and listening in on Ethan and &quot;Cassandra's&quot; conversation. Helena reappears on February 24, 2012 when she shows her face to Ethan and &quot;Cassandra&quot;. She insists it's time to end the charade and tell Ethan the truth. Ethan's shocked when he realizes that Helena and &quot;Cassandra&quot; know each other. It hits him even harder, when &quot;Cassandra&quot; announces under the pressure of Helena that she really is Irina Cassadine, Helena's daughter. Irina tells Ethan that she was forced to play the part and take a place in Helena's never ending vendetta against Laura and the Spencer family. Helena seeks her goal when she informs Ethan that she wanted him to fall for Irina in order to break his heart. Irina tries to convince Ethan that she's fallen in love with him and doesn't want to lose him. Helena claims that Irina is still playing him and then she lets two of her men bring in a beaten up Luke. Ethan is shocked to learn that Luke was captured by Helena all this time since he thought his father was on one of his adventurous trips. Helena then announces that one of them is going to die. She ends up shooting her daughter, killing her.

On November 30, 2012, Helena is seen once again as [[Robert Scorpio]] pays her a visit. After she is told of Robert's suspicion that [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]] is still alive, Helena calls Faison once Robert leaves to warn him that Robert is on to him.

On March 29, 2013, Helena reappears when she is suspected of kidnapping Lulu and shooting her grandson Nikolas. Luke and Laura learn that Helena stole the Haunted Star and they go to the boat with Dante to find Lulu. Helena's men hold Luke and Laura at gun point when Laura accuses Helena of shooting Nikolas. Helena refuses to believe Nikolas has been shot, but confirms it after calling to the hospital, and insists she was not responsible. Dante then shows up to save Luke and Laura and while Dante stays with Helena, the two of them go to a room where they believe Lulu is being held. Instead they find Ethan, who was caught while Helena was looking for Lucky. Helena reappears with her men as Luke, Laura, and Ethan, are out on deck, having apparently gotten free from Dante. Helena gives Laura a gun and offers to give them Lulu if Laura shoots Ethan, but then offers for her to shoot Luke instead. Luke and Laura use their apparent compliance as an opportunity to turn the gun on Helena's men. Luke then shoots Helena and confirms that she is dead. However, later on, it is revealed that Helena's body was frozen.

Helena is revealed to be alive, thanks to Robin's miracle formula. Helena has in her possession the frozen embryo of Stavros and Lulu. She also reveals that she has big plans for both [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] and Robin, but only that Jason made his way to the residence of [[Sonny Corinthos]]. When Luke begins acting rather strangely, it appears that somebody has taken over his identity and that he is in cahoots with Helena, but eventually, he is revealed to indeed be Luke suffering from D.I.D. Luke and Helena prove to be a dangerous pair and in one of her most nefarious acts, Helena along with Luke plans to blow up the Cassadine yacht with many Port Charles residents aboard. Their plan fails, and Luke is put into a mental hospital while Nikolas bans Helena to banishment in the Cassadine compound once again, this time apparently for good. Several months go by, and after Luke discovers the reasons for his D.I.D. learns that his son, Ethan, has been kidnapped. Luke confronts Helena but she appears to be a shell of herself, admitting defeat for the first time and warning him that Nikolas has all the power now. In a sense, she seems pleased with this, her plans for him finally achieved. Helena's farewell gift to Luke is a shocker: his grandson, Jake, whom Luke had believed he had killed several years before. Luke is stunned when Helena gives Luke a goodbye kiss, certain that they will never cross paths again.

By late November 2015, Jason has learned his true identity and clues take him, Samantha and Elizabeth to the Cassadine compound where Helena appears to be dying. Nikolas is present in an apparent last visit with his hated grandmother and is doting on the dying woman. Confronted by threats from Samantha, Helena gives her a taste of the Cassadine curse after Samantha insists that Mikkos loved Alexis's mother, not her. As Helena prepares to tell Jason the truth about his identity, she slips into unconsciousness and her doctor indicates that Helena is dead (once again). Efforts by Elizabeth to revive her to reveal what she knows proves futile and the three leave. Nikolas admits to his dead grandmother that for as much as he hated her, he also admired her for her class and determination to keep the family strong. The following February, various Port Charles residents showed up for the filmed reading of Helena's will where she continued her game playing from beyond the grave, sending Laura on a wild goose chase in regards to an empty book and giving Alexis the knife with which she slit her mother's throat. Helena continued to appear to various characters in their nightmares, harassing them in regards to the curse she had put on them at the time of her death.

==Fictional character biography==
The Chameleon was born a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizen named '''Dmitri Smerdyakov''' (Дмитрий Смердяков). In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to [[Kraven the Hunter]] (Sergei Kravinoff) and eventually became a minor associate to [[The Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers]]. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to Smerdyakov, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the [[United States|United States of America]]. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery.

The Chameleon inspired Kraven to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; With Kraven, the Chameleon battled [[Iron Man]],&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of Suspense'' #58&lt;/ref&gt; and then confronted the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tales to Astonish'' #66&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the Chameleon disguised himself as [[Hank Pym]], and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. While delivering the documents and a shrunken Hulk to [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], he was encountered and defeated by Ant-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #154&lt;/ref&gt; The Chameleon disguised himself as the [[Torpedo (Marvel Comics)#Brock Jones|Torpedo]] and battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #134&lt;/ref&gt;

When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #294&lt;/ref&gt; the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on superconductors, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #307&lt;/ref&gt; He then kidnapped [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. He approached the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] for support to become New York's new crime lord, and formed an alliance with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].&lt;ref&gt;''Web of Spider-Man'' #50-55&lt;/ref&gt; Disguised as a scientist, the Chameleon temporarily removed Spider-Man's powers. He allied himself with the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]] to eliminate Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], but escaped when his plan failed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #340-343&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chameleon's most ambitious play against Spider-Man happened when he formed an alliance with [[Harry Osborn]] as the Green Goblin. Before Harry's death, he told Chameleon Spider-Man's secret identity could be found through Peter Parker, to construct androids of Peter's parents; Chameleon later admitted that he went through with the plot to confirm once and for all that Peter was Spider-Man. The plan led to a psychotic breakdown for both Spider-Man and Chameleon, Spider-Man briefly renouncing his civilian identity while Chameleon is sent to Ravencroft Asylum.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} However, when Doctor [[Ashley Kafka]] sneaks him into a basement to try to continue treating him in the belief that he was close to a breakthrough when the court were preparing to put him on trial, Chameleon escaped and attempted to convince Spider-Man that he was actually a hallucinating writer who had suffered a mental breakdown after his daughter's death in a car accident, but Peter managed to break through this deception due to his own strength of will.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #242&lt;/ref&gt; Chameleon's confirmation of Spider-Man's secret identity led him to try to attack Spider-Man through his family and friends, but this effort met with rather dismal results when [[Mary Jane Watson]] subdued him with a baseball bat.&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #244&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere in between this and subsequent appearances, he appeared to have been destroyed by his nephew [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]]; Alyosha later threw a Chameleon mask at Spider-Man's feet, referring to it as 'That weakling Dmitri' but apparently recovered, waking in a hospital.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

After tricking Spider-Man to the bridge where [[Gwen Stacy]]'s death occurred, on the pretext of having kidnapped his wife, he declared his own loneliness and love for Peter. When Peter laughed, he threw himself off the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;''Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; He reappeared some time later in a [[mental institution]], completely incapacitated, believing himself to be Sergei Kravinoff rather than Dmitri Smerdyakov.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} He later reappeared in his Chameleon identity as part of the [[Sinister Twelve]] villain team organized by [[Norman Osborn]] as the Green Goblin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spider-Man was unmasked, the Chameleon gathered a gang of villains called the Exterminators,&lt;ref name=&quot;marvunapp.com&quot; /&gt; including [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will O' The Wisp]], [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] and also blackmailed the [[Molten Man]] into his employ all in an effort to defeat Spider-Man and attack his family.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

However, the Chameleon was dealt a most humiliating defeat at the hands of [[Aunt May]], when he attempted to trick her into believing he was Peter, then murder her. However, May was not fooled by any means, and defeated the villain with a plate of oatmeal-raisin cookies laced with [[Ambien]]. The [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] was also employed as part of the team up and later defeated Spider-Man only to be unable to collect payment from Chameleon as he was already captured.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #31-#33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Chameleon showed up among the villains at [[Stilt-Man]]'s funeral at the Bar with No Name where [[Punisher]] poisoned the drinks and blew up the bar.&lt;ref&gt;''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===MODOK's 11===
The Chameleon next appeared in the newest incarnation of ''Super Villain Team-Up'', called [[MODOK]]'s Eleven. In this limited series it is revealed that he contacted [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] the moment he was telepathically summoned by MODOK. He then allowed A.I.M. to send in their newest creation the [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] under the guise of being the Chameleon.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Additionally, it was revealed in ''Super Villain Team-Up: MODOK's Eleven'' that his apparent insanity and demise years earlier were in fact well-crafted ruses designed so that he could fade into the background once more.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===One More Day===
The ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' storyline ended with the removal of Peter and Mary Jane's timeline from all memories, and no one knows Spider-Man's identity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chameleon returns to New York more sadistic and sociopathic than ever before. To complete his hired goal of bombing City Hall, he kidnaps and takes the identity of Peter Parker who works for Mayor J. Jonah Jameson. While posing as Parker, he tries to better his life, revealing that he always tries to rectify the problems in the lives of his &quot;faces&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #602&lt;/ref&gt; Using Peter's security clearance to get access to various materials, Chameleon was poised to bomb City Hall before Peter escaped and thwarted his plans as Spider-Man. During the resulting confusion, Chameleon escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #603&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grim Hunt===
Sometime later at an alley building, a distraught Chameleon is met by Kraven the Hunter's wife Sasha Kravinoff and her daughter [[Kraven the Hunter (Ana Kravinoff)|Ana Kravinoff]] who want his help in avenging the death of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604&lt;/ref&gt; Various follow up issues during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline show Chameleon helping the Kravinoff family into creating an alliance of Spider-Man's enemies as well as [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #607&lt;/ref&gt; First, he and Sasha managed to spring Electro from prison.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614&lt;/ref&gt; Then Chameleon approached Mysterio stating that he has friends that are &quot;dying&quot; to meet him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #620&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to the ''Grim Hunt'' part, he posed as [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] in order to get close to Spider-Man, defeat him, and bring him to the Kravinoffs in order to sacrifice him as part of a ritual that will revive Sergei Kravinoff.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635&lt;/ref&gt; After Sergei is resurrected, the Chameleon states that the problem might stem from inward anger of being resurrected. He and the Kravinoffs discover Spider-Man's corpse, which turns out to be [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] in Spider-Man's costume instead.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #636&lt;/ref&gt; The real Spider-Man goes to take revenge on the Kravenoff family. Spider-Man soon arrives and pulled Chameleon and Alyosha into the huge nest of spiders. Sasha realizes that the Kravenoff family wasn't hunting the spiders, but it was the spiders hunting them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #637&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the Species===
During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, Chameleon is invited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his supervillain team where he becomes involved in securing some specific items for him. He poses as Harry Osborn to trick Spider-Man by telling him that [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant has died. When Spider-Man has been away, Chameleon got the infant.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Octopus later talks with the Chameleon saying that the baby is the first of a new species. Using a lead gained when he took down [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], Spider-Man arrives at the Kravinoff Mansion where he captures Chameleon who reveals that the baby is still alive and is in the clutches of the Lizard.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinister Six===
Chameleon later becomes a member of Doctor Octopus's latest incarnation of the Sinister Six. He poses as Captain [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] in order to infiltrate an Air Force base.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648&lt;/ref&gt; Chameleon disguises himself as a tribal chief when he and Mysterio pull off a zombie pirate attack on some natives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659&lt;/ref&gt; Using robots of the other Sinister Six members, Chameleon and Mysterio pulled off this scheme as a diversion so that Doctor Octopus and the other Sinister Six members can infiltrate the Baxter Building to look for specific technology plans while the [[Future Foundation]] were investigating the more obvious threat.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #660&lt;/ref&gt;

Chameleon later poses as [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] in order to infiltrate [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] so that he can help the Sinister Six steal their Zero Cannon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Chameleon was present with the Sinister Six when Doctor Octopus tells them his master plan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682&lt;/ref&gt; Chameleon was present at [[Palazzo Senatorio]] at a summit where the world's greatest minds and the world leaders is carried out to discuss about Doctor Octopus' supposed offer to save the world with Chameleon disguised as [[Al Gore]]. As Al Gore, Chameleon states that Doctor Octopus would save them. Without a counter-argument, Spider-Man punches Al Gore and reveals to everyone present that Al Gore is actually Chameleon in disguise. Spider-Man stated that his new costume could detect which person is actually Chameleon based on his heartbeat. A transmission from Doctor Octopus states that he has activated the Octavian Lens which are blocking the harmful UV rays from the sun in order to reinforce his offer. After letting Chameleon go, Spider-Man secretly places a Spider-Tracer on Chameleon so that he and the Avengers could follow him. They follow Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coasts where the rest of the Sinister Six is waiting for Chameleon. Using many of the stolen objects, the Sinister Six successfully subdue the Avengers leaving only Spider-Man standing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683&lt;/ref&gt;

After Spider-Man and the Black Widow escape with the help of [[Silver Sable]], Chameleon suggest that since the remaining members of the Sinister Six had each received their $2 billion and their criminal records expunged, they should just leave Doctor Octopus and his scheme. However, they stay on board as that would make an enemy out of Doctor Octopus. The Chameleon later gets involved with Mysterio in tricking Spider-Man and his allies into thinking they were destroying Symkaria, in order to give Doctor Octopus more time to complete his 200 satellites. However, the Chameleon is captured and the Black Widow threatens to reveal the secret behind his real face.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''[[Dying Wish]]'' storyline, Chameleon later fights [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) and the [[Secret Avengers]] on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; Chameleon ends up knocked unconscious and Superior Spider-Man transports him to his hidden underwater lab where he ends up imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Avenging Spider-Man'' #21&lt;/ref&gt; Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the &quot;Superior Six&quot;. Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them do heroic deeds against their will which almost get some of them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, while nearly destroying New York in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.&lt;ref&gt;''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deadpool Annual===
Following the return of the true Spider-Man, Chameleon attempts to drive Spider-Man insane as revenge for the Superior Spider-Man's treatment of him during the events of &quot;Superior Six&quot;. However, Spider-Man's ally [[Deadpool]] switches costumes with Spider-Man, with Chameleon unaware of this. He fails at driving &quot;Spider-Man&quot; insane (as Deadpool is already insane), and ends up being shot in the leg by him. Both heroes (in each other's costumes) punch the Chameleon at the same time, knocking him out and later delivered him to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadpool Annual'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, the Chameleon had no superhuman powers and simply used makeup and elaborate costuming to impersonate his targets. In order to do this, he implemented a device in a belt buckle that emitted a gas that helped him mold his features. Later, the Chameleon obtained a microcomputer from [[Spencer Smythe]] for his belt buckle that could be programmed with the facial features of hundreds of people.{{issue|date=May 2012}} The belt buckle also contains a video receiver that enables the computer to analyze the appearance of anyone the Chameleon encounters so that it can duplicate his/her features using electrical impulses. The computer utilizes [[hologram|holographic]] technology that allowed him to change his appearance at the push of a button. His electronic devices allowed him to appear as two different people to two separate observers simultaneously. The Chameleon's costume consists of &quot;memory material&quot; that can be altered by electrical impulses from his belt so as to resemble the clothing of the person he is impersonating.

Later, the Chameleon's powers are made innate: his [[skin|epidermis]] and skin pigmentation have been surgically and [[mutagen]]ically altered by a serum so that he can take on the appearance of any person at will.{{issue|date=May 2012}} He also wears fabric made of memory material that responds to nerve impulses and can appear to be whatever costume he wishes to be.

When his past friendship with Kraven the Hunter was revealed, it was also revealed that the Chameleon had taken the same serums that Kraven had taken over the years.{{issue|date=May 2012}} This would suggest that the two characters were of a similar age (over 70 years old). It would also suggest that the Chameleon's physical strength and endurance could be somewhat augmented, but as the Chameleon's strength is much lower than that of Kraven, his augmentations may not reach a [[superhuman]] level.

Aside from his physical advantages, the Chameleon is a master of disguise, and a brilliant [[method acting|method actor]] and impressionist. He is also a master of creating lifelike masks and make-up. He is a quick-change artist who can assume a new disguise in less than a minute, although he no longer needs to use such skills. He also speaks several languages fluently. Although the Chameleon is not a scientific genius, during his increased lifespan he has been exposed to a wide array of sophisticated experimental technology, much of which he can apply effectively in his nefarious schemes.

In his 2010 appearances in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', writer [[Fred Van Lente]] placed a stronger emphasis on his skills of disguise rather than his superhuman powers. In this portrayal, Chameleon kidnaps people and brutally kills them by dumping them in an acid bath. From listening to them beg for their lives, he alters his pitch to sound exactly alike and takes a face print to make into a mask. This more chilling Chameleon also seeks to fix the lives of his &quot;faces&quot;, attempting to rectify the problems of their lives while he poses as them as a part of some warped heroic view of himself.{{issue|date=May 2012}}

==Other versions==

===Chameleon 2099===
In [[Marvel 2099]], a [[designer drug]] that causes its users to involuntarily shapeshift in response to whatever emotion they are feeling at the time is nicknamed &quot;Chameleon&quot;. After fighting an addict (who turned into a bull-like monster when angered and a mouse-like creature when frightened) at [[Woodstock]] 2099, the era's [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] tracks down the distributor of Chameleon, a hippy known as Major Jones. While battling Jones and his minions, Spider-Man accidentally knocks the dealer into his supply of the drug, causing him to mutate into an amorphous blob, the new Chameleon.&lt;ref&gt;''2099 Unlimited'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chameleon 2211===
A version of Chameleon appeared in ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man''. He has the powers of physically changing into any shape or form after accessing their [[DNA]]. This usually involves sampling their blood after killing the subject, although less lethal methods are possible; he was able to change into [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after an accidental ingestion of some of his sand.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Chameleon encounters an alternate Uncle Ben from another future who has been transferred into the 'main' timelined by [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Hobgoblin 2211|Hobgoblin]] of 2211, attempting to influence Ben to kill [[Edwin Jarvis]] for his current involvement with this timeline's [[May Parker]] by arguing that, since the multiverse means every action possible is being committed, you might as well do what feels good. When Ben rejects the suggestion, Chameleon kills and replaces him. This fools [[Spider-Man 2211]] whom he then kills when he arrives to try to return 'Ben' to his reality. After discovering the body, Sandman's father was framed for Ben's murder, and Sandman went to Spider-Man for help.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The two encountered Chameleon at Peter's high school (Chameleon had murdered the principal and was posing as him), where Chameleon reveals that he wasn't human at all but a giant monster. Chameleon was finally defeated, however, after Spider-Man (of Earth 616) used Spider-Man 2211's helmet to literally &quot;administer poetic justice&quot;, causing a last-minute body switch between Chameleon and Sandman's father into an electric chair.&lt;ref&gt;''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-Earth===
Spider-Man faces the [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of The Chameleon in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' #5. This Chameleon, a reptilian [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Bestial]], is a depraved serial killer who both Spider-Man and a bestial [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] team-up to defeat.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Chameleon appears in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'' as twin siblings with the ability to shape-shift. One poses first as [[J. Jonah Jameson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], while the other keeps the real Jameson and Peter Parker restrained.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; They are defeated by [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]], and imprisoned in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Action Hour: Iron Man===
In ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' during [[The Marvel Action Hour]], the Chameleon appeared in #4 of the cartoon based comic in service to [[Justin Hammer]]. He used his transformation abilities to obtain the Grim Reaper weapon from Stark Enterprises.

===Marvel Noir===
In ''[[Spider-Man Noir]]'', Dmitri Smerdyakov (a.k.a. The Chameleon) is depicted as a former Coney Island freak working for mob boss [[Norman Osborn]] (a.k.a. &quot;The Goblin&quot;). Like his mainstream counterpart, he has the ability to alter his features to imitate any individual, although this ability stems from his clay-like malleable features rather than any technological advantages. Osborn has him impersonate [[J. Jonah Jameson]] in order to eliminate [[Ben Urich]] and set a trap for Spider-Man. He was killed by [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] when she witnesses him as Jameson killing Ben.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Noir'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Chameleon's first animated appearance was in ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Tom Harvey (actor)|Tom Harvey]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} He was seen in the Iron Man segment episode &quot;Cliffs of Doom&quot;, working with [[Kraven the Hunter]] to steal Tony Stark's magneton laser. Chameleon is also seen in The Incredible Hulk segment episode &quot;Enter the Chameleon&quot;. 
* Chameleon appeared in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[John H. Mayer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the episode &quot;Arsenic and Aunt May&quot;, he met a relative of the [[Burglar (comics)|man]] that shot [[Uncle Ben]] poses as Ben's ghost with his female associate posing as a gypsy to manipulate [[Aunt May]] into killing [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spider-man.toonzone.net/Episodes/Arsenic.html]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Amazing chameleon.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Chameleon in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.]]
* Chameleon was a featured villain in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Hans Conried]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the episode &quot;Seven Little Superheroes&quot;, he lured Spider-Man, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Firestar]], [[Captain America]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna the Jungle Queen]] to the remote Wolf Island to pick them off one by one. He is foiled by Miss Lion (Aunt May's dog who had tagged along with Spider-Man on the trip).[[File:Chameleon-in-Spider-Man-TAS.jpg|185px|thumb|Chameleon in the [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'' animated series]].]]
* Chameleon appeared as a recurring villain in the 1990s [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|''Spider-Man'' animated series]], having no speaking lines in his true form yet voiced by multiple voice actors via matching whomever he is impersonating. An international [[hitman]] and [[espionage|spy]], Chameleon wears a belt-mounted camera device, which is capable of capturing an image of a person, so that he can turn into that person as a form of [[disguise]]. This proved to be his undoing in his [[Day of the Chameleon|first appearance]]: he copied an image of [[Nick Fury]] from a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' front page which had been inadvertently flipped. Thus, Fury's [[eyepatch]] was on the wrong side and Spider-Man pointed out to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents he was an impostor. During all this, [[Mary Jane Watson]] met Chameleon, disguised as Peter Parker, and asked him to come to a Shakespeare play. Chameleon kissed Mary Jane on the lips passionately to hide from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Mary Jane kissed Chameleon back, thinking that he was Peter and thought he promised her to come to the play. Chameleon, disguised as Peter, later attempted to kill two diplomats at a [[United Nations|U.N.]] conference, but was foiled by Spider-Man, easily picking him out from the crowd as he had taken Peter's appearance. Chameleon later becomes a member of the Insidious Six where he took the form of a prison guard to free [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Mysterio]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Doctor Octopus]] from the prison cells.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Insidious Six&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Insidious Six&lt;/ref&gt; During all this, Chameleon impersonated various individuals; the Kingpin only to say one sentence, [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to help kidnap Silvermane, [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]] to trick Silvermane's henchmen, and even Aunt May to mess with Spider-Man. In the episodes &quot;Framed&quot; and &quot;The Man Without Fear&quot;, Chameleon works for [[Richard Fisk]], framing Peter for getting restricted government information. Chameleon even posed as Spider-Man to abduct Peter from the paddy wagon outside of the courthouse after the first half of Parker's trial. After Parker's name is cleared by Spider-Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], Chameleon as well as Richard and rogue Federal Agent Susan Choi are arrested, put on trial, and sentenced to prison.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Framed&quot; and &quot;The Man Without Fear&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Chameleon is jailed in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison and was assigned by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to impersonate and release John Hardy, using his newfound ability to take on different forms without his camera device. In the episode &quot;Six Forgotten Warriors&quot;, Chameleon was sprung from prison by the Kingpin and the Insidious Six in order to find the keys to the [[Red Skull]]'s doomsday device. When Red Skull was freed from the time dilation loophole, it was revealed that Chameleon is Red Skull's stepson. In the end, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] along with Red Skull and Captain America were trapped in a time dilation loophole and Chameleon escaped.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]&quot; part 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ChameleonSSM2008.png|185px|thumb|left|Chameleon in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.]]
* Chameleon appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0802/01/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Friday, February 1, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His first chronological appearance was in the episode &quot;The Uncertainty Principle&quot; where a business competitor hired him to disguise himself as [[Norman Osborn]] and steal [[Oscorp]]'s secrets. In the episode &quot;Persona&quot;, he is hired by an unnamed general to steal the [[Venom (comics)|symbiote]] but failed due to a battle between Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. Later, he masquerades as Spider-Man to commit various crimes and lay the blame on the web-slinger. His henchmen are Quentin Beck using special effects techniques to make it appear that Chameleon has all of Spider-Man's powers, and [[Tinkerer|Phineas Mason]] using inventions to help commit the crimes and secretly photograph them and give the pictures to the ''Daily Bugle''. To defeat him, Spidey teams up with Black Cat. In the series finale &quot;Final Curtain&quot;, Norman and [[Harry Osborn]] are watching on a helicopter while the Green Goblin is fighting Spider-Man. After Spider-Man rips off the Goblin's mask which reveals Norman, Harry discovers Chameleon as an impostor, remembering Norman saying sorry to Spider-Man earlier (as Norman never apologizes to anyone). Harry yanks at his face and the mask comes off, revealing Chameleon. Chameleon then bails by jumping out of the helicopter with a parachute after saying 'I did not sign in for this'.

===Video games===
* Chameleon appears in the SNES version of ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man]]'', a video game based on ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''. He attacks the player by mimicking the appearances of the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ7uJD3QU3g&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chameleon appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' video game, voiced by Glenn Steinbaum. He has been posing as [[Donald Menken]] so that he can oversee the Kingpin's experiments. In the post-credits scene, Chameleon asks what their next plan is. The Kingpin states to Chameleon that &quot;the real work begins&quot;.

'''JR Chandler''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[The Online Network]] daytime drama ''[[All My Children]]''. He was portrayed by [[Jacob Young]] from 2003 to 2011, prior to [[Ryan Bittle]] taking over the role in 2013. Bittle was cast as the new JR on [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]]'s continuation of ''All My Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.soapsindepth.com/2013/02/amc-casts-new-jr-and-aj.html|title=AMC Casts New JR And AJ!|date=February 25, 2013|publisher=Simms, Richard|work=Soaps In Depth|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The character was originally born onscreen on July 3, 1989 to [[Dixie Cooney]] and her estranged ex-husband, [[Adam Chandler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/amc/recaps/2006/060703.php#mon|title=AMC Daily Recaps: The Week of July 3, 2006|first=Michael|last=Pesiri|date=July 3, 2006|work=[[Soapcentral]] |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-08/entertainment/8902150725_1_frisco-thorne-kimberly|title=All My Children: Frankie told Cliff and Angie that Bobby...|date=July 8, 1989|first=Nancy M.|last=Reichardt|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, the character's birth year was revised to 1983.
He is a member of both the powerful and wealthy [[Chandler family|Chandler]] and [[Cortlandt/Cooney family|Cooney]] families, being the son of Adam Chandler and great-nephew of [[Palmer Cortlandt]].

The writers characterized JR as caring, but ruthless if betrayed, explaining the latter by way of his difficult upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;totaltvonline.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Carol|last=P.|title= The tortured soul anti-hero | publisher= Total TV Online.com | accessdate=2007-05-23| url=http://totaltvonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=36 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929041114/http://totaltvonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=36 |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's softer personality has been attributed to his mother, Dixie Cooney, as well as to his son, [[AJ Chandler|AJ]], and true love [[Babe Carey]]&lt;ref name=totaltvonline.com/&gt; (who was killed off by the series in 2008).

==Character creation==
Actor [[Jacob Young]], who had been on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' ([[Rick Forrester]]) and ''[[General Hospital]]'' ([[Lucky Spencer]]) prior to joining ''[[All My Children]]'', stated that he had good instincts, but that he &quot;was young and kind of doe-eyed to the world&quot; then. It was not until the actor stepped into the ''All My Children'' role of JR Chandler that his acting range became more focused. He started to use tools he learned in classes and felt that his acting became more refined because of it. With his portrayal of JR, he explained how this factored in: &quot;They twisted JR in a completely different direction,&quot; he stated. &quot;They started off with JR not respecting his father and having a lot of elements of his mother in him. He was much more soft. Then they started toying with it and couldn't believe what was coming out of me. I'd always been the nice, honorable guy; I'd never been the character who was stirring the pot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lensch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=Tonya |last=Lensch| title= Jacob Young - Young Gun | publisher=''[[Soap Opera Weekly]]'' |date=2005-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
JR's rich lifestyle was something that Young noted not being familiar with, stating that the JR persona did not come to him until he would put on the suit. &quot;They put me in these nice designer suits, and I suddenly feel like a million bucks. Then I take that million-buck feeling and go a little sinister with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lensch&quot;/&gt;

One aspect of JR's personality are &quot;devious tones&quot; sometimes present in his dialogue. &quot;When the character is in a good mood and has the upper hand, he has all these one-liners,&quot; Young relayed. When working with former ''All My Children'' co-star [[Alexa Havins]] (ex-[[Babe Carey]]), Young would often shock Havins with the character's words. To make sure she was unaware of how he was going to deliver a crass line, he would keep it hidden [during rehearsal].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lensch&quot;/&gt; &quot;You can break the wording down and make it a little more offensive,&quot; he cited. &quot;And I try to nail that because that's what JR's supposed to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lensch&quot;/&gt;

The writers were looking for an actor who could truly radiate the essence of [[Adam Chandler]]'s son, and felt that taking JR down the path of darkness would help with that. Young, the actor chosen as best suited for the part, detailed the transition: &quot;They wanted it to be 'like father, like son,' so I watched [[David Canary]]'s (Adam) mannerisms and delivery. I tried to mold those into my own, enough to where I could be his son. They started writing my dialogue like his. He has some one-liners that are pretty funny. David is as big a goofball as I am onset. He's like, 'Here's my boy!' We have a great dynamic together.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lensch&quot;/&gt;

Young's portrayal of JR propelled the character into one of the show's more popular and hated characters.{{quote|text=Have you seen those piercing blue eyes? When they're not flashing with anger, a glimpse of the troubled young man who was deeply wounded by the presumed death of his mother shows through. Like Babe, we could easily fall into the trap of thinking that a little tender loving care from us would fix him right up.&lt;ref name=&quot;SID&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Men You Love to Hate | publisher=''[[Soaps In Depth]]''|date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=''[[Soaps In Depth]]'' magazine on JR being a love-to-hate fixture}}

It is revealed that JR has been in a coma for five years. On the night that changed Pine Valley five years ago (the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series finale), the drunken JR was about to shoot someone, but David Hayward intervened; JR pulled the trigger and shot someone in the house, while David shot JR and put him in a coma. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that JR shot and killed [[Marissa Tasker]], his ex-wife (David's daughter).

'''Chapel''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] comic book character appearing in books published by his creator, [[Rob Liefeld]]. Liefeld created the character in 1992 as member of the government superhero group ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'', which started in their series of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/02/the-abandoned-an-forsaked-so-who-killed-spawn/ |title=The Abandoned An’ Forsaked – So WHO Killed Spawn? – Comics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book ResourcesComics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book Resources |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional character biography ==
'''Bruce Stinson''' was a [[soldier]] who upon later in his career took the role of employment in Operation Knightstrike alongside Al Simmons, a fellow soldier-turned-[[mercenary]]. According to the Spawn animated series, Chapel was born in a prison in Joliet, Illinois. He is a known smoker and womanizer, who is proficient in unconventional warfare such as torture. At one point Chapel was ordered by his superior to [[murder]] Al Simmons. The order was given because Al Simmons was a suspected spy. However, Al Simmons became the dark [[vigilante]], [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]].

Throughout his career Bruce was instilled with several [[chemical]]s which in turn would give him various superhuman abilities. Unbeknownst to Chapel, he was also injected with a type of [[HIV]] which could be activated by his superiors by a special serum.  One of Chapel's bosses, [[Jason Wynn]], who had frequent feuds with Al Simmons, commissioned Chapel to kill Spawn.  A while after Al Simmons' death, Chapel became a member of [[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]].

Wynn also, for a time, turned on Chapel, trying to use his old enemy Giger to take him down after Chapel refuses a mission from Wynn. This story also introduces Duke, an old colleague of Chapel and Simmons that was a supposed traitor to the group.&lt;ref&gt;''Youngblood Strikefile'' #1–2 (April–May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spawn eventually regained his memory of Chapel being his killer and began hunting him.  Spawn ambushed Chapel and took him to a swampy area, where Chapel had his face cut out by Spawn (in the shape of a skull).  Afterwards Chapel was forced to replace the missing skin with a skull that he had grafted onto his bone (where his facial skin used to be).

Afterwards, he continued to work with Youngblood for a time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WildC.A.T.S.&quot; #3 (December 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he confronts extra-dimensional invaders that plague the religious hero 'John Prophet'.&lt;ref&gt;''Youngblood'' #4 (Feb. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Chapel is later removed from [[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]] service.  Out of curiosity he hunted Spawn to try to find out the secret of his resurrection.  Upon learning about [[Hell]] and the Hellspawn process he shot himself in the head.  He awoke and instead of becoming a [[Hellspawn]] he became '''Lord Chapel''', a [[horseman of apocalypse]] in service to his mistress Calcifer.

When he was separated from this creature, Chapel returned as a woman named [[Spawn (comics)|Gazer]] only to be turned back to a man again and left feeling empty.

His most recent appearance was outside of Youngblood; he teamed-up with Spawn to face his other half, Lord Chapel.

==Publishing history==
Chapel mostly appeared in the titles ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/17560-10-image-characters-for-marvel-and-dc-to-co-opt.html |title=10 IMAGE Characters for MARVEL and DC to Co-Opt |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was also given a couple of short-lived, self-titled series. The second ''Chapel'' series, published in 1995, was written by [[Brian Witten]] and [[Eric Stephenson (comics)|Eric Stephenson]] and featured the art of [[Calvin Irving]].

==In other media==
Although absent from the [[Spawn (film)|live action Spawn film]], Chapel was replaced by [[Jessica Priest]]. Chapel (called Jess Chapel) made appearances on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Spawn (TV series)|Todd McFarlane's Spawn]]'', in which he had the same backstory as the comics version.  He was voiced by [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]].

'''Robert Chase''', [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] is a [[fictional character]] on the [[Fox network|Fox]] [[medical drama]] ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. He is portrayed by [[Jesse Spencer]]. His character was a part of the team of diagnosticians who worked under [[Gregory House]] until the end of the third season when House fires him.&lt;ref name=&quot;rightstuff&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Right Stuff| episodelink = The Right Stuff (House)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2007-10-02| season = 4| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;error&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Human Error| episodelink = Human Error (House episode)| series = House, M.D. | serieslink = House (TV series) | airdate = 2007-05-29| season = 3| number = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resumed work at the hospital as a surgeon, and was re-hired by House in season 6. Robert Chase is the longest-serving member of House's staff. Chase has been attracted to [[Allison Cameron (House)|Allison Cameron]] since the beginning of the show and embarks on a romantic relationship with her in &quot;[[Human Error (House episode)|Human Error]].&quot; In &quot;Post Mortem,&quot; he left the Diagnostic Team after realizing he was in the same position as he was 10 years earlier, unlike all of the other former members of the team. However, in the series finale, he rejoins the hospital as the new Head of Diagnostic Medicine, replacing House, who is thought to have died.

==Characterization==
Chase is [[Australians|Australian]] and was born around the year 1980. His father, [[Czechs|Czech]] Rowan Chase, was a wealthy and world renowned [[rheumatologist]] who had emigrated to Australia from Czechoslovakia before Chase was born. Chase portrayed as an enthusiastic follower of House during the first 3 seasons, often supporting his opinions and carrying out his orders without question. He was raised [[Catholic]], and in the Season 1 episode &quot;Damned If You Do,&quot; it was revealed that he attended [[seminary]] before becoming a doctor. He seems to trust House the most and sometimes takes part in House's morally questionable plans when the other members of the team have refused, showing a situational application of ethics and a flexible stance on morality. This leads to heated arguments between Chase and Foreman, who is quick to disagree with House and eager to prove him wrong.

Chase is regarded by most characters as someone who will do anything to protect his job. This is mostly due to an incident in season one when Chase, fearing for his job after House had been made to fire someone from his team, told [[Edward Vogler]] of House's illegal actions.

However, as the show progresses, Chase begins to show his real trust and respect for House. Having been on the team longer than anyone else, Chase cares for House, as shown by the hug in the Season Three episode &quot;[[Half-Wit (House)|Half-Wit]].&quot; When [[List of House characters#Michael Tritter|Michael Tritter]] is looking for information about House, Chase refuses to work with him, although Tritter tries to make it appear that he does in order to create conflict and distrust within the Diagnostics Department. Tritter's manipulation works and his relationships with Cameron, Foreman and especially House are further strained.  However, after being punched by a detoxing House for getting the correct diagnosis in &quot;Finding Judas&quot; Chase begins to develop a more decisive personality and even disagrees with House on several occasions, eventually leading to him getting fired at the end of the third season. His affection for House is also exemplified in the fifth season episode &quot;[[The Social Contract (House)|The Social Contract]],&quot; when he helps House give a patient potentially fatal surgery simply because House empathizes strongly with the patient's situation.

As a surgical [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care]] specialist, Chase performs most of the invasive medical procedures, as well as observing and helping with the team's patients' surgeries when he worked for House. After his departure from the team, Chase becomes a [[surgeon]] in the hospital, a move that House says is &quot;only one step down&quot; from his previous position. He is trained in [[hypnosis]], using this to help House recover lost memories in &quot;[[House's Head]].&quot;

Perhaps because his mother &quot;drank herself to death&quot; (his own words) after his father left her, Chase was, early in the series,  quick to blame symptoms on [[Recreational drug use|drug]] or [[alcohol abuse]]. He also displays a strong cultural bias regarding the American obesity epidemic, particularly childhood obesity--in &quot;Heavy,&quot; he initially believes that a morbidly obese girl's weight is the cause of all her other health problems until he realizes her weight is actually a symptom.

Chase has, at times, shown a shrewd capability of deducing people's motives, rather similar to House. He correctly deduced that Foreman was ashamed of the reason for his resignation, and then correctly deduced that House was also. He also figured out that House was the one who canceled Foreman's job interview in &quot;[[The Jerk (House episode)|The Jerk]],&quot; for no reason other than to get the staff to mistrust and suspect each other. Nevertheless, he is very easily manipulated, and not just by House - for instance, in [[Autopsy (House)|Autopsy]], a nine-year old cancer patient manages to steal a kiss off him, something that causes him crippling embarrassment with the team later.

==Education==
He went to medical school doing his pre-medical studies at the [[University of Sydney]] (as revealed in Season 7). He later  completed specialties in [[Intensive Care]] and [[Cardiology]]; he also took a residency in [[Neurosurgery]] at [[Melbourne Hospital]], although he never became a board certified neurosurgeon.

==Concept and creation==
When his agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase, he expected ''House'' to be a medical drama similar to ''[[General Hospital]]''. However, he was impressed with the show once his agent showed him the scripts, and found out that [[Bryan Singer]] was producing the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;young&quot; /&gt; The character of Robert Chase was originally intended to be American, but was later changed to an Englishman: after taking the role, Spencer, who is Australian, persuaded the producers to change the character into an Australian because the accent was thought to add to the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;young&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20517580-5003422,00.html Young doctor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cheetah''' is a fictional character appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media, commonly as a major adversary of the superhero [[Wonder Woman]].

There have been four different incarnations of the Cheetah since the character's debut: '''Priscilla Rich''' (the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] Cheetah), '''Deborah Domaine''' (the [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] Cheetah), '''Barbara Ann Minerva''' (the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] and current Cheetah), and '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001). In 2009, the Cheetah was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 69th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/69.html Cheetah is number 69] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510083651/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/69.html |date=May 10, 2009 }}, [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 and was created by [[William Moulton Marston]] and [[H. G. Peter|H.G. Peter]]. 

The Deborah Domaine version of Cheetah first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' #274 and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Jose Delbo]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age, Silver Age, and Post-Crisis comics history===
Prior to the 12-issue DC Comics series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985 (which is regarded as the starting point for DC's continuity prior to the 2011 [[New 52]] reboot), there were two women who donned spotted cat costumes to fight Wonder Woman as the Cheetah: socialite Priscilla Rich and her niece Deborah Domaine. While modern incarnations of the Cheetah possess superhuman powers, Rich and Domaine do not.

There are two post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs: Barbara Ann Minerva and Sebastian Ballesteros, Minerva being the more prominent of the two. While the pre-''Crisis'' Cheetahs are simply women in costumes, the post-''Crisis'' Cheetahs have taken on a more mystical note, being champions of a god much as Wonder Woman is to her patrons; actually morphing into powerfully ferocious humanoid were-cheetahs with great strength, agility, and deadly claws and fangs which make them challenging opponents to Wonder Woman and other powerful heroes in battle.

===Priscilla Rich===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;

The first woman to become the Cheetah, in ''Wonder Woman'' #6 (October 1943), is Priscilla Rich, a 1940s-era blonde [[Washington, D.C.]] debutante of aristocratic upbringing who also has an overwhelming inferiority complex and suffers from a [[split personality]]. After being eclipsed by Wonder Woman at a charity event and failing to kill her during an escapology act, Priscilla retreats to her room and collapses before her makeup mirror. There she sees an image of a woman dressed like a cheetah. &quot;Horrors!&quot; she cries, as she gazes at her evil inner-self for the first time. &quot;Don't you know me?&quot; replies the reflection. &quot;I am the REAL you—the Cheetah—a treacherous, relentless huntress!&quot; The image commands her to fashion a Cheetah costume from a cheetah-skin rug. &quot;From now on,&quot; intones the reflection, &quot;when I command you, you shall go forth dressed like your TRUE self and do as I command you...&quot; The Cheetah frames Wonder Woman for a robbery by hiding the money in her apartment and tipping off the police, then sets fire to a warehouse Wonder Woman is in, although Wonder Woman escapes. She is presumed dead, but survives thanks to her fireproof costume.

She later kidnaps a young [[extrasensory perception|ESPer]] named Gail and uses the girl's powers to learn U.S. military secrets, which she gives to the Japanese. Wonder Woman manages to thwart the plot and rescue Gail, with Cheetah warning Wonder Woman to stay out of her affairs. She soon returns when an American military official organizes an athletic competition between female athletes from America and a group of women trained on [[Paradise Island (comics)|Paradise Island]]. Priscilla ties up and gags an Olympic [[high hurdles|high hurdler]] named Kay Carlton, and impersonates her by donning her clothes. Disguised as Kay, Priscilla infiltrates the contest and manages to kidnap Queen [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] and steal her magical girdle. With Hippolyta as her hostage and her own powers boosted by the girdle, Cheetah battles Wonder Woman for control of Paradise Island. She is defeated when the Amazon manages to pull the girdle off her. Temporarily freed from the Cheetah's influence, Priscilla asks to remain on Paradise Island until she can learn to control her split personality.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla's attempt at reformation apparently failed, as she is later seen as a member of [[Villainy Inc.]], a criminal association between several of Wonder Woman's female foes.

Priscilla has several run-ins with Wonder Woman before retiring to her North Shore [[Maryland]] mansion. In ''Wonder Woman'' #274 (Dec. 1980), the villain [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] attempts to recruit the villainess for his organization. His operative finds the reclusive Priscilla an invalid. Priscilla's niece Deborah Domaine had come at her bidding, and the operative stays to observe. Before Priscilla can unburden her alter ego as the Cheetah, she dies.

DC later relaunched its continuity with the 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', introducing a new Cheetah for the Modern Age, Barbara Minerva (see below). The original Cheetah, Priscilla Rich, is established as still existing post-''Crisis'' when [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] becomes the Golden Age Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman: Our Worlds at War'' #1 (September 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In the present, she is seen as an elderly woman when she is murdered by Minerva. It is also established that she never became an invalid post-''Crisis'', as Minerva mentions how Priscilla had written books condemning her when she became the Cheetah. Rich is murdered in her home by Minerva, under the urging of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' #219 (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Zoom theorizes that if Minerva kills Rich, she would solidify herself as the one true Cheetah and thus be a better villain.

Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Rich is retconned from continuity. Priscilla Rich is one of the many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

===Deborah Domaine===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;
[[File:DeborahDomaine.PNG|Deborah Domaine as the second Cheetah, with Kobra. Art by [[José Delbo]].|thumb|left]]
Deborah 'Debbie' Domaine was introduced as the niece of Priscilla Rich. A beautiful young debutante, Debbie feels remorse for her wealthy upbringing and decides to become an ecology activist, meeting Wonder Woman and striking up a friendship with her. Later that same day, Debbie is summoned to her Aunt Priscilla's mansion and finds her there, succumbing to illness. After Priscilla Rich dies, Kobra's operatives capture Deborah and bring her and the Cheetah costume to Kobra's headquarters, where he questions her: &quot;''You didn't know about your aunt's secret life, did you? Well, you'll learn—Since we couldn't have the original, we decided to make do with a recreation. You shall be that recreation, Ms. Domaine.''&quot;

Kobra tortures and brainwashes Debbie and provides her with an updated version of the Cheetah costume. The original suit included a cat-eared cowl and clawed, flat-soled boots. Debbie's version has a V-neck, slit to the sternum, a headband with cat-ears (concealed for the most part beneath her long, auburn hair), and heeled boots. Both costumes include razor-sharp chrome steel nails, painted bright red. &quot;You are my servant, and I, your master. You are the Cheetah!&quot; he cries, &quot;And you will fill the world with terror!&quot; Debbie has several conflicts with Wonder Woman and also serves as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]] in a conflict with both the [[Justice League of America]] and the [[Justice Society of America]], before her role as the Cheetah is [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence due to the history-altering after-effects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985–1986). Debbie still exists post-''Crisis'', as referenced by a photo in Priscilla Rich's mansion inscribed to &quot;Aunt Priscilla, Love Debbie.&quot;

Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]], Deborah Domaine is [[retcon]]ned from continuity, and her name is merely one of the many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

===Barbara Ann Minerva===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;
[[File:Cheetahperez.png|thumb|Barbara Minerva as the Cheetah. Art by George Pérez.]]

The third Cheetah is British archaeologist Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva, born as the heiress of a vast fortune in the ancient family site in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Ambitious, selfish, and severely neurotic, Barbara develops a passion for archaeology that eventually led her to search out a tribe in Africa who utilizes a female guardian with the powers of a [[cheetah]]. A band of marauders kill the guardian and most of what remained of her original expedition party. Barbara, with the aid of the priest, Chuma, the caretaker of the ancient plant god Urzkartaga, takes her place after being told that she would gain immortality. Her powers are conferred to her by ingesting a combination of human blood and the berries or leaves of Urzkartaga. Unfortunately for Minerva, the host of the Cheetah persona is intended to be a virgin. Minerva is not, so her [[shapeshifting|transformations]] were part curse and part blessing, as she experiences severe pain and physical disability while in her human form and blood-thirsty euphoria while in her cat form.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-chee2&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah II | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Cheetah was somehow active before Wonder Woman's post-Crisis appearance, and confronts Catwoman in Rome during the events of ''Batman: Dark Victory'' and ''Catwoman: When in Rome.''

This version of the Cheetah comes into Wonder Woman's world when Barbara discovers that Diana possesses the [[Lasso of Truth]]. As an archaeologist, Barbara covets the lasso hoping to add it to her collection of historical items. She first attempts to do so through trickery, claiming that there is a matching ancient [[Golden Girdle of Gaea]] of the same kind from which the lasso was fashioned. Unfortunately, although the scheme proceeds far enough for Minerva to hold the lasso, its magical power to make people tell the truth forces her to confess her true intentions. Diana, profoundly distraught that a woman would be so treacherous, takes back the lasso and returns home in tears. With the subtle approach having failed, Minerva resorts to attacking the Amazon as the Cheetah in order to rob her of the lasso. Their initial battle ends with inconclusive results, as Diana's friend, [[Julia Kapatelis]], shoots the Cheetah and forces her to retreat.

Over the years, Barbara's interest in the lasso wanes and she becomes more interested in besting Diana in battle due to her bruised ego. The rivalry between the Cheetah and Wonder Woman fluctuates, though. Wonder Woman saves the Cheetah's life during an adventure in the Balkan country of Pan Balgravia.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman Special'' (vol. 2) #1 (February 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #63 (June 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The country's dictator Baron Von Nastraed, for unknown reasons, chooses to aid a demon named Drax by capturing a powerful [[metahuman]] woman. The captive woman's body would be used to house Drax's alternate dimension bride Barremargux. When the Baron captures the Cheetah for this purpose, Wonder Woman travels to the country to save her. At the last moment, when Barremargux is about to enter [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-One]], Barbara closes the gateway before the crossing could be completed by jumping into the gateway instead. Barbara is trapped in this demonic dimension until the Boston mob boss Julianna Sazia has scientists open the dimensional gateway to retrieve Barbara to serve her own ends. Barbara double-crosses Julianna, choosing to aid Wonder Woman when she is caught in the mob war between Paulie Longo and Julianna Sazia in Boston. Seeing her debt to Wonder Woman paid for attempting to rescue her in Pan Balgravia, the Cheetah continues her quest to defeat Wonder Woman when it is convenient to her.

For a brief period of time, Minerva loses her powers to the businessman Sebastian Ballesteros (see below), who convinces Urzkartaga that he could be a more effective Cheetah than she was. Minerva later kills Ballesteros and regains her powers.

The relationship Minerva has with Urzkartaga is strained at times for all of Minerva's intense devotion and loyalty. For a brief period of time the god punishes her by leaving one of Minerva's hands human looking and untransformed even while she is in her Cheetah form, though it appears to still be fully empowered as the rest of her body and equally as deadly. With help from [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], Minerva attains a level of super speed even greater than she previously possessed. She accomplishes this by murdering Priscilla Rich, who previously went by the codename Cheetah.  They later join the latest [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and seem to be engaged in a sexual relationship, though Zoom considers himself to still be married to his former wife.

In the &quot;[[One Year Later]]&quot; storyline, the witch [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] places a spell on Minerva that allows her to change her appearance from human to Cheetah at will, even though she still remains in her Cheetah form in either guise. She controls three actual cheetahs and still possesses her super speed, which is demonstrated by her ability to steal the golden lasso away from [[Donna Troy]] several times in battle. She is later seen in the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', forming a new [[Injustice League]] alongside [[Lex Luthor]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. She also appears in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Later still, in ''[[Final Crisis]]: Resist'', she joins forces with [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] to rebel against [[Darkseid]], and enjoys a brief relationship with [[Snapper Carr]]. In the pages of ''Wonder Woman'', she is revealed as the power behind the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]], responsible for the creation of [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]]. She arranges to have her ally [[Doctor Psycho]] take the place of [[Sarge Steel]] as director of the Department of Metahuman Affairs which, in the middle of Genocide's onslaught, she targets for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3) #26-28 (January–March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The New 52====
In 2011, DC relaunched its comic books, and rebooted its continuity in an initiative called [[The New 52]]. The character was re-made to be a corrupt image and antecedent to Wonder Woman. Barbara Ann Minerva (having used several aliases that happen to be the names of the various incarnations of the character) is reintroduced as Cheetah.  As part of her new backstory, Minerva is referred to as an accomplice to Wonder Woman and an expert in dangerous relics, and having previously grown up in an all-woman commune called &quot;Amazonia&quot;. In the possession of a dagger once belonging to a lost tribe of Amazons, she cut herself on it. She was possessed by the Goddess of the Hunt, transforming her into a human/cheetah hybrid. Her claws can also turn Superman into a cheetah-like being.  The origin of the Cheetah is dated back to the San Tribe, who for centuries had hunted alongside the cheetahs and every generation one of their members is chosen to become the host of the Goddess of the Hunt until one day a hunter killed the current host; the knife used to kill her was cursed until it fell in the hands of Minerva. Cheetah is subdued by the Justice League and placed in Belle Reve. However, once there, she makes contact with someone telling him she is where he requested, implying her capture was staged as a part of a bigger plan.&lt;ref name=jl13&gt;[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Lee, Jim]] (p), [[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]] (i). ''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #13 (December 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Forever Evil]] storyline, Cheetah is among the supervillains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]] to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' (vol. 2) #14&lt;/ref&gt; A vision that [[Psi (comics)|Psi]] shows to Steve Trevor is that Cheetah is in possession of Wonder Woman's lasso and is hiding out in Central Park.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; When Steve Trevor and [[Killer Frost]] arrived in Central Park to look for Cheetah, they end up ambushed by Cheetah and her Menagerie (consisting of [[Elephant Man (comics)|Elephant Man]], [[Hellhound (comics)|Hellhound]], [[Lion-Mane]], Mäuschen, Primeape, and [[Zebra-Man]]). Cheetah manhandles Trevor using Wonder Woman’s lasso. Steve Trevor manages to overcome the lasso and explains that Diana could use it only as she was herself truthful and pure. As Cheetah is not that, Trevor manages to get the lasso off and onto Cheetah. While Killer Frost escapes and freezes Cheetah’s Menagerie, Steve Trevor knocks Cheetah out.&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S.'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

====DC Rebirth====
After the events of [[DC Rebirth]], Cheetah's origin is altered. As a young girl, Barbara Ann Minerva enjoyed mythology and adventure. Rebelling against her father's wishes, Minerva became an archaeologist and traveled the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #8 (Oct 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; After Princess Diana of the Amazons returned soldier Steve Trevor to the United States, Minerva was the first to speak Diana's ancient Greek language and became Diana's first friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #6 (Sept 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; At some point later, Minerva discovers the Cult of Urzkartaga and is transformed into the Cheetah.

Wonder Woman travels to Africa in search of Cheetah. She is met with aggression from Cheetah's forces, and ultimately Cheetah herself. The battle continues until Wonder Woman reveals to Cheetah that she is unable to locate Themyscira and needs her enemy's help.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman (vol. 5) #1 (Aug 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for Minerva's help in finding Themyscira, Wonder Woman agrees to kill the god Urzkartaga and end Minerva's curse. The pair battle their way through Urzkartaga's Bouda (werehyena) minions, the Bouda, and defeat Andres Cadulo, a worshiper of Urzkartaga that planned to sacrifice Steve Trevor to the plant god.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #5 (Sept 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Once reverted back to her human form, Minerva agreed to help Wonder Woman find her way back to Paradise Island. In this version, Barbara was revealed to have been turned into the Cheetah not because she was not a virgin, and that Urzkartga lied to her - Cheetah and the women before her were actually his wardens, charged with keeping the evil plant god imprisoned. Also, despite being enemies, Diana is shown to still care for her former friend and genuinely wants to help her.  &lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 5) #9 (Oct 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sebastian Ballesteros===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;
[[File:TheMaleCheetah.png|thumb|Sebastian Ballesteros by [[Phil Jimenez]] from ''Wonder Woman'' #171 (August 2001)]]
[[Argentina|Argentine]] business tycoon '''Sebastian Ballesteros''' becomes the fourth Cheetah, as well as the only male Cheetah. He is an agent of the Amazon's enemy, [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], as well as her lover. He seeks the plant god '''Urzkartaga''' to become a new version of the Cheetah, a supernatural cat-creature like Barbara Ann Minerva. Appealing to the plant god's ego, Sebastian makes the case that the previous Cheetahs have failed in their actions and that a male Cheetah could be superior. Once Urzkartaga is convinced, Barbara Minerva's access to the Cheetah is cut off and Sebastian is given the power in her place. Later, Sebastian proves responsible for turning Wonder Woman's old friend, Vanessa Kapatelis, into the third [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]]. Angered at the loss of her powers, Barbara Minerva eventually battles Bellesteros for control of the power of the Cheetah by becoming the temporary host of [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Erinyes|Eumenides]] or Furies. Minerva accesses this new power by stealing it from the Furies former host, Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. This does not assist her in regaining the right to become the Cheetah. Ultimately (off-panel) Minerva finally kills Sebastian in his human form, regaining her Cheetah form as a result. She is later seen giving his blood to the Urzkartaga plant as a sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-chee3&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Cheetah III | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 80  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Rich and Domaine, DC appeared to remove Ballesteros from continuity in the wake of its [[The New 52|2011 reboot]]. In ''Justice League'' comics, the name ''Sabrina'' Ballesteros is shown to be one of many aliases Barbara Minerva uses to commit crimes as Cheetah.

==Powers and abilities==
Minerva, Ballesteros:
Powers and appearance of a cheetah, granted by the plant-god Urzkartaga.

Minerva:
Superhuman speed and strength, capable of going toe to toe with Wonder Woman.

==Other versions==
===DC: The New Frontier===
An alternate version of Cheetah (Priscilla Rich) briefly appears in the final issue of ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]''.

===Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon===
Another alternate version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Wonder Woman: The Blue Amazon]]''.

===JLA/Avengers===
Cheetah appears briefly as a villain under the control of [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] fighting [[Tigra]].

===Wednesday Comics===
A modernized version of Priscilla Rich appears as one of the primary antagonists of the Wonder Woman feature in ''[[Wednesday Comics]]''. Here, she is portrayed as a young archeologist from a wealthy Baltimore family, who relies on enchanted artifacts to grant her superhuman abilities. She initially befriends a young Diana, (before she has become Wonder Woman), after meeting her, but soon reveals her treacherous nature when she kidnaps Diana's friend [[Etta Candy|Etta]] and uses her as bait for a trap set by [[Doctor Poison]]. In the end, both Priscilla and Poison are defeated by Wonder Woman.

===Justice===
The Priscilla Rich version of the Cheetah appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in [[Alex Ross (comic illustrator)|Alex Ross]]' ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' maxi-series. Here, she is shown to have fashioned her costume from the fur of her pet cheetahs, which she violently killed and skinned in an ancient ritual (likely reminiscent of the Barbara Ann Minerva version). This version also appears to have retired at some point before the events of the series, as Wonder Woman mentions that Priscilla returned to the side of the &quot;Dark Gods&quot; and having been friends with her at some point. She is first seen at the opening of the series as one of the many villains suffering from nightmares about the end of the world, and the Justice League's inability to stop it. Priscilla reappears in the fourth issue, attending a peace conference held by Wonder Woman with her cheetahs, but kills them once in her hotel room before performing an ancient ritual and donning a costume made from their pelts. When Wonder Woman leaves the conference, Cheetah attacks her in the hall, slashing her several times before she escapes. It is later revealed over the course of the series that Cheetah's claws were infected with Centaur's Blood, and was turning Diana back into clay. Priscilla's attack is apparently the most successful, as Wonder Woman was slowly crumbling to the point that her face had become black and cracked by the time the Justice League attacked the Hall of Doom, relying on the powers of her lasso to keep her from crumbling apart. It is mentioned by a citizen that Cheetah ruled over a city filled with those deemed &quot;ugly&quot; by society. After the League attacks the Legion of Doom, Priscilla is one of the few villains to escape the initial attack, retreating to her city in wait for Wonder Woman. When Diana follows Cheetah with several other JLA members, they quickly realize Cheetah is stalking them and Wonder Woman tells them to leave so she can face Priscilla herself. Almost immediately after they leave Cheetah ambushes Wonder Woman, who removes her protective mask to expose that Cheetah's Centaur blood had almost killed her. Diana tells Cheetah that she has lost all patience for her before violently slamming her head into Priscilla's, breaking her Cheetah mask in half and knocking Priscilla out.

===Wonder Woman: Odyssey===
A version of the Cheetah appears in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; storyline, which involves the Gods altering Diana's history so that Themyscira was destroyed when she was a child. The new Cheetah is created from the corpse of a murdered Amazon after it is lowered into a mystical restoration pit and infused with the spirit of Magaera by the Morrigan (the villains who are hunting Wonder Woman). Alongside new versions of [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] and [[Giganta]] (both of whom are also created from dead Amazons), the new Cheetah is tasked with hunting down and killing Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #606 (February 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After tracking down the safehouse where Diana lives with the last surviving residents of Themyscira, Cheetah brutally ambushes and slays a young Amazon as she steps outside. Cheetah is then shown carrying the woman's body away from the scene, muttering about how she too will be reborn soon.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #607 (March 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Cheetah joined with [[Wonder Woman]]'s [[Female Furies|Furies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Wonder Woman and the Furies'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; After the Furies attack [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] and the Resistance, Cheetah is eaten by [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Injustice: Gods Among Us===
The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic, she was in the villains bar World's End in Keystone City, watching another villain play darts when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Wonder Woman]] suddenly burst in. Cheetah is in disbelief, her claws ready, though Wonder Woman says they are only here for [[Mirror Master]] and they don't want trouble. When Cheetah approaches menacingly, asking, &quot;And what if we want trouble?&quot; Wonder Woman advises her against it, revealing the rest of the [[Justice League]] is outside and Cheetah backs off.

===Scooby-Doo Team-Up===
In the digital-first crossover with the cast of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', Cheetah disguised herself as a ghost to attack the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] alongside the rest of the Legion of Doom. Together, the Legion captured and shrunk each member of the Super Friends until only [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]], and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] were left. Scooby and his gang were able to hold off the Legion of Doom until the miniature Super Friends broke free from their captivity. After Scooby and Shaggy became [[Sinestro Corps|Yellow Lanterns]] and restored the Super Friends to their normal size, Cheetah and the rest of the Legion of Doom were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Scooby-Doo Team-Up'' #11-12 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman===

She battles Wonder Woman briefly in &quot;Taketh Away,&quot; where it was revealed Doctor Psycho had been telepathically controlling Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Generations,&quot; she seeks out a mythical [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] egg which is said to grant immortality. After a lengthy battle with Wonder Woman, Cheetah retreats.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;The Problem with Cats,&quot; a little girl plays with her sister's dolls, one of which is dressed up to look like the Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Island of Lost Souls,&quot; Barbara Minerva requests help from Wonder Woman to retrieve the plant to save Cheetah's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wonder Woman '77===
An illusion of Priscilla Rich appears in the second story arc of the comic book based on the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman TV series]], though she did not have any appearances in that television series. She, along with several other enemies, was created by Doctor Psycho in order to battle Wonder Woman. Cheetah exclaims, &quot;I've waited decades for this moment,&quot; implying that she had battled Wonder Woman in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman '77'' #6 (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the series, Barbara Minerva becomes the Cheetah in an origin similar to that of her New 52 counterpart. Her source of power is revealed to come from the Egyptian goddess [[Mafdet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman '77'' #7 (August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; After a battle with Wonder Woman, she is taken into custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman '77'' #9 (Sept 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she reappears having escaped imprisonment.

She expresses interest in becoming an archaeologist, a nod to her main DC counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: American Alien'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Priscilla Rich version of Cheetah appeared in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by Marlene Aragon. She appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. In one of the Cheetah's most memorable episodes &quot;The Secret Origins of the Super Friends&quot;, the Legion of Doom travel into the past to eliminate Superman, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Wonder Woman]] before the three can become heroes. When the villains arrive at Paradise Island moments before Princess Diana will compete in the Tournament winning to become Wonder Woman, Cheetah disguises herself as an Amazon to compete in the games and stop Diana, her athletic skills allowing her to get through most of the competition. As the tournament ends, only Diana and Cheetah remain in contention and meet each other in a battle of stun rays to crown a winner. To assist her, Cheetah uses 'radar controlled' bracelets to deflect Diana's laser rays back, stunning the Amazon Princess. Cheetah is hailed as the winner and is presented with Wonder Woman's uniform and weapons. The blonde villainess, now wearing the Amazon champion uniform, gloats in her victory 'I've done it! Now I am Wonder Woman!'. Cheetah's victory causes Diana to be removed from the future timeline, thus eliminating Wonder Woman. However, the Legion of Doom's triumph is short lived. The remaining Super Friends uncover the scheme and travel back in time to undo the damage; the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] arrives at Paradise Island and uses super-speed to deflect the rays meant to hit Diana and back at Cheetah, stunning her. Diana is named the winner and goes on to become Wonder Woman.

[[File:Cheetahdctas.png|85px|left|thumb|Cheetah in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series.]]
* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by actress [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]. This version was once a scientist who was involved in valuable genetic research. However, her funding was running out and she was unable to perform proper experiments. In a last-ditch effort to prove her research's value, she [[self-experimentation|tested her theories on herself]], resulting in a mutation into a half-human-half-cat hybrid. Shunned by the scientific community for her recklessness and ostracized by humanity as a freak, she turned to crime to fund further research to undo the change with no alternatives. First appearing in the episode &quot;Injustice for All&quot;, she is a member of the [[Injustice Gang]]. She joins [[Lex Luthor]]'s group for the same reason she became a criminal in the first place: money - but she has little criminal intent unlike the others and merely wants to be normal again. When the Injustice Gang succeeds in capturing [[Batman]], Batman realizes that Cheetah is not like the others and offers her a way out, in exchange for helping the Dark Knight topple Luthor. However, Cheetah hesitates to take up Batman's offer although [[Ultra-Humanite|another disgruntled member]] betrays the teammates. When Luthor realizes they have a traitor in the midst, Lex points the blame toward Cheetah thanks to a clip from a security camera showing her and Batman kissing. She is knocked out by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] then taken away by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and is supposedly killed by being petted to death; an animation error causes Cheetah's existence to remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/cheetah/cheetah.htm |title=Cheetah |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kids' Stuff.jpg|thumb|Cheetah (left) battling [[Wonder Woman]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]] Cheetah reappears in the episode &quot;Kids Stuff&quot; where she fights Wonder Woman during a bank robbery.

* Cheetah appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Morena Baccarin]].

In &quot;Triumvirate of Terror&quot;, she collaborates with Lex Luthor and the Joker in order to come up with a plan to defeat Batman, [[Superman]] and Wonder Woman. She easily beats Superman with martial arts, Kryptonite and the magic amulet of Urzkartaga which channels the full power of her namesake. She is later defeated when Superman freezes her with super breath leaving her vulnerable to Wonder Woman and Batman's finishing blows. Cheetah makes a cameo appearance in the series finale &quot;Mitefall!&quot; getting hit on by [[Booster Gold]].
* The Barbara Minerva version of Cheetah appears in the third ''[[Super Best Friends Forever]]'' short. She battles [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] while the three girls argue over the name for their group.

* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah will appear in ''[[Justice League Action]]''.

===Film===
* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah briefly appears in the animated movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2009 film)|Wonder Woman]]''. She is seen near the end where she steals an artifact from a museum and attacks the police. At this point, Wonder Woman changes into her costume, jumps over the police cars, wraps Cheetah with the Lasso of Truth and tugs Cheetah towards her. Just as Wonder Woman is about to deliver a punch to Cheetah, the film ends.
*Cheetah appears briefly during the ending of ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''.
* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''. She appears as one of the many supervillains trying to collect the bounty on [[Superman]].
* The Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah appears in ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'', voiced by [[Claudia Black]] in a British accent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=1135&lt;/ref&gt; She is selected as part of [[Vandal Savage]]'s Legion of Doom, and is selected to kill Wonder Woman. She fights Wonder Woman on a boat and manages to cut Diana's arm, infecting the Amazon with a poison. The poison's power is revealed when Cheetah jumps onto the docks and attempts to escape, but when Diana follows her everyone seen was Cheetah, including civilians, cops, and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. Wonder Woman began fighting every Cheetah seen, knocking out police, civilians, and ripping off Cyborg's arm (although Cyborg was able to reattach it soon after). Cyborg deduced that Wonder Woman, due to an upbringing as a warrior, would keep fighting to the end, overstraining herself, and causing heartbeat, blood pressure and breathing go off the scale, thus Cheetah's intent was either make Wonder Woman's heart give out, suffer an aneurysm or have Diana get shot by police, and managed to cure Diana before either of those eventualities came to pass. She joins Savage's plan for genocide, seeing no other options, and slits Savage's throat and does kill him, but the immortal quickly gets up and hits her in the head. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, she takes on Wonder Woman herself, but she is eventually defeated by Diana. Of special note, she is the only character from the ''original'' group that appears in the film.

'''Le Chiffre''' ({{IPA-fr|lə ʃifʁ}}, ''The Cypher'' or ''The Number'') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1953 first [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. On screen Le Chiffre has been portrayed by [[Peter Lorre]] in the [[Casino Royale (Climax! episode)|1954 television adaptation]] of the novel for [[CBS]]'s ''[[Climax!]]'' television series, by [[Orson Welles]] in the [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|1967 spoof]] of the novel and Bond film series, and by [[Mads Mikkelsen]] in the [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|2006 film version]] of Fleming's novel.

Fleming based the character on [[occult]]ist [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ben Macintyre | title = Was Ian Fleming the real 007? |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 5 April 2008 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3652410.ece | accessdate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novel biography==
Le Chiffre, alias &quot;Die Nummer&quot;, &quot;Mr. Number&quot;, &quot;Herr Ziffer&quot; and other translations of &quot;The Number&quot; or &quot;The Cipher&quot; in various languages, is the paymaster of the &quot;Syndicat des Ouvriers d'Alsace&quot; (French for &quot;Alsatian Workmen's Union&quot;), a [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]]-controlled trade union.

He is first encountered as an inmate of the [[Dachau]] [[displaced persons camp]] in the US zone of Germany in June 1945 and transferred to [[Alsace-Lorraine]] and [[Strasbourg]] three months later on a stateless [[passport]]. There he adopts the name Le Chiffre because as he claims, he is &quot;only a number on a passport&quot;. Not much else is really known about Le Chiffre's background or where he comes from, except for educated guesses based on his description:

{{quote|Height 5 ft 8 ins. Weight 18 stones (114 kg, 252 lbs). Complexion very pale. Clean shaven. Hair red-brown, 'en brosse' (crew cut). Eyes very dark brown with whites showing all round iris. Small, rather feminine mouth. False teeth of expensive quality. Ears small, with large lobes. Hands small, well-tended, .. Racially, subject is probably of Albanian ancestry. He dresses well and meticulously, generally in dark double-breasted suits.}}

He is also fluent in Albanian, French, English, and German with traces of a [[Marseille]] accent.

[[File:Peter_Lorre_as_Le_Chiffre.jpeg|thumb|[[Peter Lorre]] as Le Chiffre in the [[Casino Royale (Climax!)|1954 TV adaption of ''Casino Royale'']].]]

In the novel, he makes a major investment in a string of brothels with money belonging to SMERSH. The investment fails after a bill is signed into law banning prostitution. Le Chiffre then goes to the casino Royale-les-Eaux in an attempt to recover all of his lost funds. [[MI6]] sends Bond, an expert [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] player, to the casino to bankrupt Le Chiffre and force him to take refuge with the British government and inform on SMERSH. Bond bests Le Chiffre in a game of [[Baccarat (card game)#Chemin de fer|Chemin de Fer]], taking all of his money. Le Chiffre kidnaps Bond's [[Bond girl|love interest]], [[Vesper Lynd]], to lure him into a trap and get his money back. The trap works, and Le Chiffre [[torture]]s Bond to get him to give up the money. He is interrupted by a SMERSH agent, however, who shoots him between the eyes with a [[Suppressor|silenced]] [[TT pistol]] as punishment for losing the money.

Le Chiffre's death is seen by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government as an embarrassment, which in addition to the death and defeat of [[Mr. Big (James Bond)|Mr. Big]] in ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', leads to the events of ''[[From Russia with Love (novel)|From Russia With Love]]''.

===Novel henchmen===
* Basil – bodyguard and martial arts expert who takes pleasure in roughing up Bond. He is later killed by a SMERSH agent.
* Kratt - Le Chiffre's [[Corsica]]n bodyguard who wields a walking-stick gun with which he threatens to cripple Bond at the gaming table. He is later killed by a SMERSH agent.

==1967 film biography==
[[File:Orson Welles As Le Chiffre in Casino Royale (1967).png|thumb|right|[[Orson Welles]] as Le Chiffre in ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale (1967)]]'']]

Le Chiffre is a secondary villain in the 1967 [[satire]] and appears in the only segment of the [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|film]] actually adapted from Fleming's book. As in the novel, Le Chiffre is charged with recovering a large sum of money for SMERSH after he loses it at the [[baccarat]] table. He first attempts to raise the funds by holding an auction of embarrassing photographs of military and political leaders from China, the US and the [[USSR]], but this is foiled by Sir James Bond's daughter, [[List of characters in Casino Royale (1967)#Mata Bond|Mata Bond]]. With no other option, he returns to the baccarat table to try to win back the money. Later, he encounters baccarat Master [[List of James Bond characters in Casino Royale#Evelyn Tremble|Evelyn Tremble]], who has been recruited by Bond to stop Le Chiffre from raising the money. Le Chiffre attempts to distract Tremble by performing elaborate magic tricks, but fails to prevent Tremble from winning. Afterwards, he arranges for Tremble to be kidnapped and subjects the agent to [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] torture in order to get back the money. The torture session is interrupted when his SMERSH masters, led by the film's main villain, Dr. Noah, shoot him dead.

==2006 film biography==
Le Chiffre is the main villain of the official 2006 James Bond film, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', portrayed by [[Danish people|Danish]] actor [[Mads Mikkelsen]]. Believed by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] to be [[Albanians|Albanian]] and officially [[stateless person|stateless]], Le Chiffre is a financier of international terrorism. [[M (James Bond)|M]] implies that Le Chiffre conspired with [[al-Qaeda]] in orchestrating [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], or at least deliberately [[war profiteering|profiteering]] from the attacks by [[short selling]] large quantities of airline stocks beforehand. In the video game version of ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', it is said that his birth name is &quot;Jean Duran&quot;, in the [[MI6]] mission briefings. A mathematical [[genius]] and a [[chess]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], his abilities enable him to earn large sums of money on games of chance and probabilities, and he likes to show off by playing [[poker]]. He suffers from [[haemolacria]], which causes him to weep blood out of a damaged vessel in his left eye. As in Fleming's novel, dresses in immaculate black suits and uses a [[Salbutamol]] inhaler, here plated with platinum.

Le Chiffre is contacted by [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]], a representative of an elite criminal organisation [[Quantum of Solace (film)|later]] revealed to be [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] (which is [[Spectre (2015 film)|later]] shown to be a department within [[SPECTRE]]). White introduces [[Steven Obanno]], a leader of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] in [[Uganda]], to Le Chiffre, and arranges to bank several briefcases full of cash for Obanno. Le Chiffre invests the money along with his other creditors' money in the aircraft manufacturer SkyFleet. Though SkyFleet's shares have been skyrocketing, he plans to short the company by purchasing [[put option]]s, and ordering the destruction of the company's new prototype airliner, set to make its first flight out of [[Miami International Airport]]. Bond intervenes and foils the plan, costing Le Chiffre millions.

In order to win the money back, Le Chiffre sets up and enters a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]] in an attempt to recoup his losses before his clients find out that their money has been misappropriated. Bond is sent to make sure that Le Chiffre does not win back the money; if Le Chiffre is bankrupt, he will be forced to turn to MI6 for asylum, in exchange for information on his creditors and employers.

During the tournament, an enraged Obanno and his lieutenant break into Le Chiffre's hotel room and threaten him and his girlfriend, [[List of James Bond henchmen in Casino Royale#Valenka|Valenka]]. Le Chiffre, who does not object to the threatened amputation of Valenka's arm, is granted one last chance to win their money back. As Obanno leaves the room, his bodyguard spots Bond and hears Valenka's cries coming from Bond's earpiece. Bond kills the bodyguard by throwing him over a railing, then chokes Obanno to death after relieving Obanno of his machete. [[Rene Mathis]] arranges the blame to be placed on Le Chiffre's bodyguard Leo.

During the tournament, Le Chiffre initially outwits and bankrupts Bond, who cannot get additional funding from [[HM Treasury]] accountant [[Vesper Lynd]], who has accompanied Bond to make sure the money is used properly. However, [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] agent sent to participate in the game, also in hopes of bankrupting Le Chiffre, agrees to bankroll Bond, on the condition that CIA is allowed to take Le Chiffre in afterwards. Desperate, Le Chiffre has Valenka spike Bond's drink. Bond almost dies, but, thanks to an [[antitoxin]] kit in his car, a defibrillator, and Vesper's timely interference, he is revived at the last moment and returns to the game. During the final round, Le Chiffre's [[List of poker hands#Full house|full house]] bests the hands of the two players preceding him, but loses to Bond's [[straight flush]].

Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper, forcing Bond to give chase, and leads him straight into a trap. Le Chiffre leaves Vesper, bound at the feet and hands, in the middle of the road, and Bond is forced to swerve to avoid hitting her and crashes his car.

Semiconscious, Bond is stripped naked and bound to a chair with the seat removed. Le Chiffre proceeds to bludgeon Bond in the [[testicles]] repeatedly with the knotted end of a ship's lanyard, each time demanding the password for the account into which the tournament winnings will be transferred. Bond refuses to give in, taunting him with the knowledge that he knows Le Chiffre's clients will track and kill him. Le Chiffre gloats that, even after he kills Bond and Vesper, MI6 will still give him sanctuary in return for information. When Bond refuses to give in, Le Chiffre brandishes a knife and is about to [[castration|castrate]] him when he hears gunshots from outside. Seconds later, Mr. White bursts into the room brandishing a handgun. Le Chiffre pleads for his life, but Mr. White nevertheless shoots him above the left eye. To date, he is the only main Bond villain to die before the film's final act.

'''Joe Chill''' is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by [[DC Comics]], usually as a villain in stories featuring [[Batman]]. In many versions of Batman's origin story, he is a mugger who murders young Bruce Wayne's parents, thus making him indirectly responsible for Batman's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Bill Finger|penciller=Bob Kane|story=The Batman Wars Against the Dirigible of Doom|title=Detective Comics #33|date=November, 1939|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Joe Chill first appears in ''Detective Comics'' #33 and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
Not much is known about Chill except that he is, in most versions of ''Batman'', a petty mugger who kills Bruce's parents [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]] while trying to take their money and jewelry. When he demands Martha's necklace, Thomas moves to protect his wife and Chill kills him; he then kills Martha when she screams for help (in one [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] version, Martha dies from a heart attack brought on from the shock of seeing her husband murdered). Chill panics and runs away when Bruce begins crying and calling for help &amp;mdash; but not before the boy memorizes his features. In at least three versions of the ''Batman'' mythos, the Waynes' killer is never identified.

===Pre-Crisis version===
Batman's [[origin story]] is first established in a sequence of panels in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #33 (November 1939) that is later reproduced in the comic book ''Batman'' #1 (Spring 1940), but the mugger is not given a name until ''Batman'' #47 (June–July 1948). In that issue, Batman discovers that Joe Chill, the small-time crime boss he is investigating, is none other than the man who killed his parents. Batman confronts him with the knowledge that Chill killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill, believing there is no way Batman could know this, accuses him of bluffing, but Batman reveals his [[secret identity]] quoting &quot;I'm the son of the man you murdered. I'm Bruce Wayne.&quot; Terrified, Chill flees and seeks protection from his henchmen. Once his henchmen learn that Chill's actions led to the hated Batman's existence, however, they turn on their boss and gun him down before realizing how priceless his knowledge of Batman's true identity is. Before the dying Chill has a chance to reveal Batman's identity, the Dark Knight intervenes and knocks out the goons so they will never hear what Chill has to say. Chill expires in Batman's arms, acknowledging that the Dark Knight got his revenge after all. [[Len Wein]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] add a one-panel coda in their retelling of this scene in the first issue of [[The Untold Legend of the Batman]]. Batman stands over Chill's body and says &quot;No, Chill -- The Batman didn't finish you... It was Bruce Wayne!&quot;

In ''Detective Comics'' #235 (1956), Batman learns that Chill was not a mere mugger, but actually a [[hitman]] who murdered the Waynes on orders from a [[mob boss]] named [[Lew Moxon]]. Batman also deduced that was why he himself was unharmed by Chill at that incident, so he would inadvertently support Moxon's alibi that he had nothing to do with a robbery that became a [[felony murder]].

In ''The Brave and the Bold'' #79 (Sep. 1968), Joe Chill is revealed to have a brother named Max who is also a criminal. Max Chill is suspected of having murdered Boston Brand (AKA [[Deadman]]), though the suspicion proves erroneous. Max is killed when a stack of [[slot machine]]s falls onto him.

In ''Batman'' #208 (Jan./Feb. 1969), it is revealed that both Joe and Max had changed their name to Chill from Chilton and that their mother is Alice Chilton was the housekeeper to Bruce Wayne's uncle Philip Wayne. Philip became guardian of Bruce after his parents' deaths. As he was often away on business, Mrs. Chilton played the primary parental role in the boy's life. As an adult, Bruce continues to visit the elderly woman, whom he still calls &quot;Ma Chilton&quot;. He is unaware of her connection with Joe and Max Chill. For her part, Mrs. Chilton knows Bruce is secretly Batman and is proud of him. She is also aware that her sons died fighting him as she still mourns their deaths.

===Modern Age version===
In the 1987 storyline &quot;[[Batman: Year Two]]&quot;, Chill played a key role. Several [[Gotham City]] crime bosses pool their resources to deal with a [[vigilante]] called the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]], and Chill is hired to take him out. When Batman proposes an alliance it is agreed that he and Chill will work together &amp;mdash; something Batman finds repugnant, but which he nevertheless justifies to himself as necessary to tackle the Reaper. He vows to kill Chill afterwards. Chill is also commissioned to kill Batman after the Reaper has been disposed of. During a major confrontation, the crime bosses are all killed in a battle at a warehouse, in which the Reaper seemingly also perishes. Chill reasons that he now no longer needs to fulfill his contract, but Batman takes him to &quot;[[Crime Alley]]&quot;, the scene of his parents' murder. There he confronts Chill and reveals his identity. Batman has Chill at gunpoint, but the Reaper appears and guns Chill down. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Batman would have actually pulled the trigger.

In the 1991 sequel to &quot;Year Two&quot;, ''Batman: Full Circle'', Chill's son Joe Chill, Jr. assumes the identity of the Reaper in order to seek revenge for his father's death. He attempts to drive Batman [[insanity|insane]] by using [[hallucinogenic]] drugs in conjunction with a faked video of the Waynes' murder to trigger Batman's [[survivor's guilt]] over his parents' death. After the intervention of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], Batman frees himself from the drug-induced haze. After the new Reaper is defeated, Batman learns to let go of his hatred of Chill.

In ''Detective Comics'' #678, a &quot;[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]&quot; crossover story, Batman finds himself in an alternate timeline where he was the mugger's victim, not his parents. Investigating the crime, he discovers that Chill, at least in this timeline, did not commit the murder. Once he returns to his proper time, Bruce Wayne is plagued with doubt. He wonders if it is possible that he never actually caught or confronted his parents' killer. He also wonders if that makes any difference regarding his crimefighting career. Ultimately, he concludes that it does not.

In 2006, ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #6 reestablished that Chill murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne, and that he was later arrested on that same night for their murder.

In the 2008 [[Grant Morrison]] story &quot;Joe Chill in Hell&quot; (featured in ''Batman'' #673), Chill is reinterpreted as a mid-level crime boss who builds the Land, Sea, Air Transport company from the ground up (most likely through illegal means). He blames his crimes, including murdering the Waynes, on [[class conflict|class warfare]]. In this story, Batman has visited and frightened Chill every night for a month. Chill is living as a shut-in, but his guards never see or catch Batman during the visits. On his final visit, Batman gives Chill the gun he used to kill the Waynes. There is one bullet left within it. Chill finally realizes who Batman is and fears what his fellow gangsters would do to him if they found out. It is hinted that he commits [[suicide]]. Considering the issue consists of Bruce's flashbacks and hallucinations from an experiment he undergoes during his early career, however, it is left ambiguous whether the events of the issue are real.

In 2009's ''[[Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], Joe Chill is seen as the bartender attending Batman's funeral (the funeral itself being a [[near death experience]]). Batman, who is observing the event as well as [[Catwoman]], note that Joe Chill should be dead. Chill notes that he was there at the birth of Batman and it is only fitting he should be there to witness the end.

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]], the 2011 reboot DC Comics' continuity, an 18-year-old Bruce Wayne tracks Chill down and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know who hired him to kill his parents. Chill responds that he just wanted Martha Wayne's pearls so he could buy alcohol and that he didn't even know who the Waynes were until the next day. Enraged that his parents died for nothing, Bruce prepares to kill Chill, but relents at the last minute when he realizes that his father would not have wanted that. After sparing Chill's life, Bruce Wayne leaves Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight'' #0 (November 2012). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 1986 [[limited series]] ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', Bruce Wayne finally resolves his feelings towards Chill (who is not named). While about to be mugged by street punks, Bruce initially [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasizes]] that the two amateur criminals are Chill, so he can take out his rage on them. They leave him alone, however, after realizing he would have fought them where he quoted &quot;Look at him. He's into it.&quot; &quot;No fun when they're into it.&quot; Bruce realizes that Chill had not killed his parents for killing's sake, as the two punks wanted to do to him, and thus was not truly [[evil]]. &quot;All he wanted was money,&quot; he thinks to himself. &quot;He was sick and guilty over what he did. I was naïve enough to think him the lowest sort of man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'' #1 (February 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comics featuring the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], it is revealed that on the Syndicate's alternate Earth that Joe Chill is a friend of Dr. Thomas Wayne. One night, a police officer wants to bring the elder Wayne in for questioning. When he refuses, the police officer opens fire. This Earth's version of Bruce Wayne and his mother are killed. Chill comes out of the alley to discover the dead bodies and the Waynes' younger son [[Owlman (comics)|Thomas Wayne Jr.]], leaves with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberger2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Greenberger|title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xyy1631tGz8C|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=10 June 2008|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-50106-6|page=285|chapter=Owlman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the alternate universe of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', Joe Chill shoots and kills the young Bruce Wayne,&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Batman – Knight of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Wayne seeks to kill him and avenge his son. He locates Chill and attempts to inject him with a drug, but instead beats him to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Batman – Knight of Vengeance'' #3 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Thomas puts Chill's gun in a trophy display in the [[Batcave]].&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Chill is featured in many [[Elseworld]] titles, including [[Superman: Speeding Bullets]],&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Speeding Bullets''&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen Wayne,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Chronicles'' #21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Batman: In Darkest Knight]],&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: In Darkest Knight''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Batman: Holy Terror]],&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Holy Terror''&lt;/ref&gt; Batman in Arkham,&lt;ref&gt;''Batman of Arkham''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[JLA: Destiny]],&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: Destiny''&lt;/ref&gt; and Dark Knight Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Knight Dynasty''&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Chill appears in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #17, which is set in the continuity of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[DCAU]] spinoffs. In a story by [[Ty Templeton]] entitled &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, Chill is shown to have spent his whole life as a career criminal since the night he murdered Bruce's parents. The story begins with Chill being released from prison after finishing a sentence for an unrelated crime, and it is apparent that he has been living in fear since that fateful night. Chill is convinced that Bruce Wayne, now one of the most powerful men on the planet, is biding his time to exact revenge. Chill's paranoia is so severe that he begins to see Bruce's face everywhere around him, even on other people. His paranoia goes into overdrive when he discovers that the retired detective who originally worked on the Wayne case has finally discovered evidence to reveal his guilt. Chill tracks the retired detective to his apartment and attempts to kill him, but Batman intervenes, unaware of who Chill is. In a brief scuffle Chill manages to unmask Batman, revealing the visage of Bruce Wayne. Terrified, Chill falls off a balcony, and Batman jumps after him in an attempt to save his life. Batman nearly catches Chill, who pushes him away and falls to his death. Batman is left at the end of the story wondering who the mysterious man was and why he would rather die than accept his help. In ''Batman Beyond'', Bruce has found out that Joe Chill was the one who murdered his family.

In ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond Unlimited]],'' set in the [[DC Animated Universe]], Chill is revealed to have a brother. Chill's grandnephew eventually has a child of his own, Jake. In the continuity, Jake Chill is a former security guard at [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne-Powers]], working under [[Derek Powers]]' &quot;Quiet Squad.&quot; Having killed Warren McGinnis under Mr. Fixx's orders, Jake repeats his great-granduncle's history with the Waynes and indirectly creates another [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]]. Though no one has discovered his involvement with McGinnis' murder, Jake Chill is wracked with guilt and decides to become a vigilante to redeem his family's sins.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' #5 (June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Jake takes the name '''Vigilante''', modified the uniform he got from his former employer as his costume, and works with Batman to stop a riot led by the [[Jokerz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' #8 (September 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He is eventually killed in the &quot;Mark of the Phantasm&quot; storyline, where he suffers a seizure after being injected with Joker Toxin and inhaling the Phantasm's fear gas. Though Terry lashed out at Jake after discovering Jake killed his father, he ultimately respected Jake as a hero and didn't think that Jake deserved to die the way he did.

In [[Andrew Vachss]]' novel ''[[Batman: The Ultimate Evil]]'', Chill (who is never seen) is revealed to have killed Bruce Wayne's parents on the orders of an international ring of [[pedophilia|pedophiles]]. They wanted to silence Bruce's mother [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], who was investigating a network of [[sexual slavery]] and [[child pornography]].

On the alternate world of [[Earth-Two]] as part of ''The New 52'', Joe Chill is a hired assassin who shoots Thomas and Martha Wayne. Chill is later killed when Thomas Wayne (who had survived the shooting) crushes his skull in retaliation for Martha's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2 Annual'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the prequel comic to ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', Joe Chill is the right-hand man of Lew Moxon. When [[Man-Bat|Batman]] corners them during a meeting with the other crimelords, killed Lew Moxon and drank Joe' Chill's blood. Upon becoming a vampire, Joe Chill later kills Lew Moxon's wife Angela. Batman avenged her death by killing the vampire Joe Chill with an axe.

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians|Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' episode &quot;The Fear&quot;, a flashback depicts Thomas and Martha Wayne being mugged by someone who might be Joe Chill. When his father tries to fight him, a young Bruce quotes &quot;No Dad, he's got a...&quot; and [[lightning]] is shown in the sky as his parents are shot offscreen. This flashback is later induced by the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]. Eventually, Batman breaks free from the hallucination and destroys the device upon seeing it as the mugger's head which he punches. This episode represents the first time that Batman's origin is portrayed on television.
* The ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode &quot;[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]&quot; features an appearance by Joe Chill voiced by [[Kevin Conroy]] (the voice of Batman in the [[DC animated universe]]). In the episode, Batman is captured by the Black Mercy plant, which traps its prey in the fantasy of their heart's desire. While under the plant's spell, Batman hallucinates that his father beats Chill up after disarming him. When [[Wonder Woman]] tears the plant off of Batman however, the vision returns to reality with Chill shooting and killing Bruce's parents offscreen.
* Joe Chill is the main focus in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode &quot;[[Chill of the Night!]]&quot; voiced by [[Peter Onorati]]. This version of the character is a hitman who kills Thomas and Martha on orders from his boss [[Lew Moxon]] as revenge for Thomas Wayne putting him in jail. In the present day, Moxon is dying and confesses to a priest (Batman in disguise) that Joe Chill is an [[arms dealer]] who sells weapons to super-criminals on the [[black market]] while also showing remorse that Joe also killed Martha when the hit was for Thomas. Joe Chill is then shown auctioning a sonic weapon to the assembled villains (consisting of [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], and [[Two-Face]]). Batman confronts him, revealing his secret identity. Terrified, Chill asks for the villains for help, but when he acknowledges that Batman is the son of people he killed, the villains turn on him, accusing him of &quot;creating&quot; Batman. Batman defeats the villains, but [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] manipulates events so that Joe Chill dies when Batman redirects the attack of a sonic gun, causing the roof to collapse on him. Joe Chill dies in Batman's arms. This episode marked the first time in the history of animation that Batman confronts the killer of his parents.
* In the series premiere of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', a masked mugger (portrayed by Danny Schoch) kills Thomas and Martha Wayne following a mugging, leaving only Bruce alive. This was also witnessed by Selina Kyle. It is unconfirmed whether or not the mugger was in fact Joe Chill, but the mugger's actions put him in a similar role as Chill in the series. What James Gordon learned from the description by Bruce Wayne is that he wore somewhat expensive shiny shoes. In the episode &quot;The Fearsome Dr. Crane&quot;, Selina's recent claim of seeing the mugger's face was of a false witness towards about the mugger's identity. In the episode &quot;Rise of the Villains: Tonight's the Night&quot;, Theo Galavan claims to the young Bruce that he knows who the mugger is and is asking to make a deal to control Wayne Enterprises, while withholding the document file of the mugger's identity. When Gordon and the GCPD police arrested Galavan and his cover was blown, he threw the document file to the fireplace to burn it. Though its possibly he lied in order for Bruce to hand him the company. In the episode &quot;Rise of the Villains: The Son of Gotham,&quot; [[Silver St. Cloud]] under the pressure of Tom &quot;The Knife&quot; claimed that the person who shot Thomas and Martha Wayne was &quot;[[List of minor DC Comics characters#Matches Malone|M. Malone]]&quot; upon overhearing her stepuncle Theo mention the name.

===Film===
* In the original script for 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', crime boss [[Rupert Thorne]] hires Joe Chill to murder Thomas Wayne due to the latter running against Thorne for city council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/batmanscript1.txt&lt;/ref&gt; In the final version of the film, however, Jack Napier (who would later become the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]) is Thomas and Martha's killer when Thomas tries to fight Napier's partner during a group mugging. Before Napier can shoot Bruce, he and his partner end up having to flee before the police show up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Comics Interview]] #77, [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/michael-uslan-reddit-ama/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119094758/http://comicsalliance.com/michael-uslan-reddit-ama/ |archivedate=2015-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Joe Chill appears in ''[[Batman Begins]]'', portrayed by [[Richard Brake]]. This version of Chill claims to have been &quot;driven to mug&quot; the Waynes by poverty as Gotham had suffered an [[economic depression]] because of an unspecified plot by the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]]. Chill mugs the Waynes at gunpoint, demanding their wallets and jewelry. Thomas willingly gives him his wallet, but quickly moves to defend his wife when Chill grabs her necklace. In the ensuing scuffle, Chill shoots them both dead. He is caught very shortly thereafter, convicted, and sentenced to prison. After serving 14 years in prison, Chill makes a deal to be released and put on [[parole]] in return for testimony against his cellmate Gotham mob boss [[Carmine Falcone]]. During the hearing, he claims to regret his crime as Bruce leaves the courtroom. After the hearing as Chill is escorted out of the courthouse, he is shot and killed by a female assassin of Falcone's who is posing as a reporter, which deprives Bruce of his own chance for revenge. Bruce later confronts Falcone, who taunts him by saying that Chill bragged that Thomas Wayne &quot;begged like a dog&quot; before his death. Later on in the film, Batman relives his parents' murder under the influence of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin. As in the ''Year Two'' storyline, it is left ambiguous whether or not Bruce would have actually killed Chill.
* Joe Chill appears briefly in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', portrayed by Damon Caro who was uncredited for his role. He is the unnamed killer featured during the opening credits and a flashback later on, both of which show his slaying of the Waynes while mugging them after they and their son Bruce finished watching ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Video games===
* Joe Chill is referenced in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. Batman, under the influence of the Scarecrow's fear gas, relives his parents' murder. In the hallucination, Joe Chill's voice is distorted and the person providing the voice was uncredited.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', the Monarch Theater where Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne are murdered is present in Arkham City. The chalk outline of the bodies of Thomas and Martha are behind the building with a bouquet of flowers near the chalk outline. The player can take the opportunity to have a moment of silence for them.
* Joe Chill appears in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Jarion Monroe]]. In this game, it is revealed that Chill worked as a hitman for Carmine Falcone and murdered Thomas and Martha on behalf of [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]]. He was later imprisoned for his crime and stabbed to death by a fellow inmate acting under Hill's orders.
* The opening of ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]'' has the player witness Joe Chill killing Bruce's parents, marking the only time where Joe Chill is seen in the ''Arkham'' games.

'''Graham Clark''' is a fictional character from the British soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Kevin Pallister]]. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 August 1998.

==Creation and casting==
In early August 1998, Steven Murphy of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' reported that [[Rachel Hughes]] ([[Glenda McKay]]) would gain a new love interest in the form of &quot;a handsome teacher&quot; called Graham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Steven|date=8–21 August 1998|title=A Dale of a time|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura (UK) Ltd|issue=107|page=8|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy said &quot;But in traditional soap style, all isn't going to exactly to plan with the budding romance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;/&gt;

==Storylines==
Graham is a local schoolteacher who looks around Keeper's Cottage after [[Lady Tara Oakwell]] evicts [[Seth Armstrong]] and [[Betty Eagleton]]. When he discovers the reason for the sale, he refuses to buy it. He began dating Rachel Hughes. Graham at first appeared to be a perfect boyfriend for Rachel. He moved in with her and redecorated her home, cooked and even alphabetised her CD collection. But gradually Graham began to take control of Rachel's life. He got her to dress differently and die her hair auburn so that she resembled his dead wife. Graham later took Rachel for a walk in the countryside and Rachel realised that Graham had an overwhelming desire to control every woman he dated. Rachel tried to escape but Graham tried to force himself on her and she fled away in fear until Graham trapped her on a clifftop. After a short talk, Rachel realised Graham had murdered his wife and made it look like she had committed suicide. Graham then pushed Rachel off the cliff and killed her.

He later went to the police station and reported Rachel missing and joined the search to find her to avoid suspicion. When he arrived at the place where she had fallen, Graham pretended to have just come across her body to divert suspicion away from him.

Graham pretended to be grief-stricken and told [[Eric Pollard]] that Rachel had accepted his marriage proposal to her. But Eric had spoken to Rachel the day before her death and knew that she had been thinking of ending her relationship with Graham. Eric was suspicious of Graham and, believing he had killed Rachel, he tried to find incrimination evidence against Graham but was unsuccessful.

After Rachel's death Graham moved on to her friend [[Kathy Brookman|Kathy Glover]]. Kathy had been engaged to [[Biff Fowler]] but Biff was convinced that Kathy was attracted to Graham. In an attempt to break up their relationship Graham actively encouraged Biff to think that there was an attraction between them. Finally on his and Kathy's wedding day Biff saw that Kathy was watching out for Graham to arrive and he decided that as she wasn't committed to him he jilted her at the altar and rode off on his motorbike.

With Biff gone Graham could start a relationship with Kathy and they later planned to marry. When Eric accused Graham of murdering Rachel, he left the village with Kathy and took her on a romantic weekend away.

While driving with Graham it became clear to Kathy that there was something wrong with Graham and when he realised her suspicions he tried to gain control of the car but it went off the road and teetered on a cliff edge before finally falling over the edge. The car ended up bursting into flames when it landed on the [[beach]] and Graham was killed. Kathy managed to get out of the car in the last second and was helped up the cliff by Eric and [[Marlon Dingle]] who had been in pursuit.

He is the brother to [[Ghost (Hamlet)|King Hamlet]], second husband to [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] and uncle and later stepfather to [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]. He obtained the throne of [[Denmark]] by murdering his own brother with poison and then marrying the late king's widow. He is loosely based on the [[Jutes|Jutish]] chieftain [[Feng (Claudius)|Feng]] who appears in ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. There had never been an actual Danish King of that name. 

==Overview==
Claudius is seen at the beginning of the play to be a capable [[monarch]] as he deals diplomatically with such issues as the military threat from [[Norway]] and Hamlet's [[clinical depression|depression]]. It is not until the appearance of King Hamlet's Ghost in the courtyard that the reader questions his motives. During the play's progression he takes a turn for the worse by first resorting to [[spy]]ing, and, when that fails, [[murder]].{{Infobox Shakespearean character

It is in Act III Scene 3, when Claudius forestalls Hamlet's revenge by confessing his sins to God in his own private chapel, that the audience can be sure of his guilt. He is shown to be discontent and unhappy with the events taking place. The young prince spies him brooding about his wrongdoings and trying to pray for forgiveness, but he knows all too well that prayer alone will not save him if he continues to benefit from his own sin. If he were to truly repent, he would have to confess his sin and give up all he achieved through it, which he chooses not to do. Despite his remorse, the King still seeks Hamlet's death in an effort to save both his throne and his life, as he believes the prince is now aware of his part in Old King Hamlet's death. Hamlet is ready to kill him, only to back down, feeling that to kill the King in such a way would contradict the revenge conditions given to him by his father, who commanded him specifically: &quot;Taint not thy mind.&quot;

When [[Laertes (character)|Laertes]] seeks [[revenge]] for his father [[Polonius]]' death at Hamlet's hands, Claudius finally concocts a 'surefire' plan to deal with Hamlet once and for all. He arranges a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes, but plots with Laertes to poison his foil and give Hamlet a poisoned drink. The king's plan fails; Queen Gertrude drinks from the poisoned chalice instead of Hamlet and dies, and Hamlet, after being struck by the poisoned foil, captures the same sword and strikes Laertes, who then finally reveals Claudius' plot. As Norway's army, led by young Prince [[Fortinbras]], surrounds the castle, Hamlet finally exacts his revenge and slays Claudius by stabbing him with the sword and then forcing him to drink the very poison that he had intended for Hamlet.

==Interpretation==
The character Claudius is both the major antagonist of the piece and complex. He is the [[villain]] of the piece, as he admits to himself: &quot;O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven&quot; (Act III, Scene 3, Line 40). Yet his remarkable self-awareness and remorse complicates Claudius's villain status, much like Macbeth. Claudius's [[fratricide]] is the corruption permeating the play's world – that which is, in the words of Marcellus (a guard), &quot;[[something is rotten in the state of Denmark]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 147&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Charles|title=Critical Companion to William Shakespeare: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2005|pages=147|isbn=0-8160-5373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare reminds the audience of the crime several times by having characters mention the story of [[Cain and Abel]], including Claudius himself, who admits being inflicted with &quot;the primal eldest curse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 147&quot; /&gt; Claudius' cruelty is reflected in his schemes to kill Hamlet – sending him to England to be killed, as well as setting up a rigged fencing match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot; /&gt; Claudius is also a heavy drinker, proposing numerous toasts and presiding over a rowdy court; he appropriately succumbs to his own poisoned wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 147&quot; /&gt;

The king is not without redeeming virtues, though. He is seen to be an able monarch (notwithstanding the unfavourable comparison to his murdered predecessor in Hamlet's first soliloquy) as well as a quick thinker and smooth talker, who in Act IV, Scene 5 converts [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] from rebel to accomplice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot; /&gt; In Act III, Scene 1 he fleetingly shows remorse for his crimes, and attempts to pray in Scene 3, even as he realizes that he cannot sincerely repent (&quot;Words without thoughts never to heaven go&quot;), and eventually continues in his evil ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot; /&gt; Most commentators agree that the king's evil nature is evident, and that the other aspects of his nature exemplify Shakespeare's ability to portray his villains as fully human.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot; /&gt;

The king is named after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Claudius|Claudius I]], who was considered the archetype of an evil ruler in Shakespeare's time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Charles|title=Critical Companion to William Shakespeare: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2005|pages=148|isbn=0-8160-5373-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical Claudius's [[incest]]uous marriage to and alleged poisoning by [[Agrippina the Younger]], who was later herself murdered by her son [[Nero]], are mirrored in the play, as Hamlet himself appears to note in Act III, Scene 2: &quot;Soft! now to my mother. / O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever / The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom ....&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce 148&quot; /&gt;

Although the character is referred to as &quot;Claudius, King of Denmark&quot; in one stage direction, the name &quot;Claudius&quot; is never spoken by any character in the play.

==Portrayals==
[[Eduard von Winterstein]] portrayed Claudius in the 1921 German silent film adaptation of ''[[Hamlet (1921 film)|Hamlet]]''.

[[Basil Sydney]] portrayed Claudius in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Hamlet (1948 film)|film adaptation of ''Hamlet'']]. 
 
[[Alan Bates]] portrays Claudius as a drunken, buffoonish, craven schemer in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s [[Hamlet (1990 film)|film adaptation of ''Hamlet'']].

In [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s 1996 film version of ''Hamlet'', Claudius is played by [[Derek Jacobi]]. Jacobi had not only been Branagh's mentor as an actor, but had previously played Hamlet himself with [[Patrick Stewart]] playing Claudius in a [[BBC]] production.

In [[Michael Almereyda]]'s [[Hamlet (2000 film)|2000 film version]] of ''Hamlet'', Claudius is played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]].

[[Patrick Stewart]] once again portrayed Claudius with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 2008, in a production directed by [[Gregory Doran]].

==Characters modeled on Claudius==
Claudius also inspired the character [[Miraz]] in [[C.S. Lewis]]' novel ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', part of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series.

[[Ron Perlman]] portrays [[Clay Morrow]] in the television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', which relies heavily on the general plot structure of ''Hamlet''; his character is based on Claudius.  Ron Perlman has said, &quot;I'm sure they’re going to stick to the structure of ''Hamlet'' all the way to the end&quot; of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[The Lion King]]'', the villain, [[List of The Lion King characters|Scar]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Irons]]), is modeled after Claudius; both characters murder their brothers and dissemble to their nephews in order to ascend to the throne. Like Hamlet, Simba causes Scar's death.

'''Clayface''' (stylized as '''CL''Λ''YF''Λ''CE''') is an alias used by several fictional [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Most of them possess [[clay]]-like bodies and [[shape-shifting]] abilities, and all of them have been depicted as [[List of Batman Family adversaries|adversaries]] of [[Batman]].

In 2010, [[IGN]] named Clayface the 73rd-greatest villain in comic book history.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]], the original Clayface (Basil Karlo) was a [[B-movie]] actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain he portrayed in a [[horror film]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clayface I-IV | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 85 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of [[science fiction]]-inspired foes, including Matt Hagen, a treasure-hunter given vast shape-shifting powers and resiliency by [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[protoplasm]], who became the new Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of [[comic book]] history. In the late 1970s, Preston Payne became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Preston Payne used the second Clayface's blood to create a cure but instead became a claylike creature that needed to pass his condition on to others to survive.

Sondra Fuller of Strike Force [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]], used the [[terrorism|terrorist]] group's technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as Lady Clay. She formed the Mud Pack with the original, second, and third Clayfaces. During that time, Payne and Fuller had a son dubbed &quot;Cassius 'Clay' Payne&quot;, who also had [[metahuman]] clay powers. During this era, the original Clayface used the [[DNA]] of Payne and Fuller to become the most powerful Clayface.

Clayface has appeared in three [[animation|animated]] adaptations of Batman, starting with the late 1970s-era ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', which featured a comedic version of Hagen. The 1990s-era ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' featured a past-his-prime actor [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a car accident who uses an experimental, addictive cosmetic to regain his appearance only to become a monstrous hunk of clay after a massive overdose of the substance. This interpretation, like the series' [[Mr. Freeze]], was applauded as a deeper, more sympathetic version of a sci-fi-era villain, and the comic book incarnation of the Basil Karlo Clayface was retooled after it. The 2000s-era ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a new character [[Ethan Bennett]], who had ties to a young Bruce Wayne, as Clayface before introducing a version of Basil Karlo.

In 2009, Clayface was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 73rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/73.html Clayface is number 73 ], [[IGN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Basil Karlo===
[[File:Clayface2.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Basil Karlo Clayface. Art by [[Glen Orbik]] and Laurel Blechman.]]
The original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #40. He is an actor who is driven insane in anger when he hears that a remake of the classic [[horror film]] he had starred in, ''The Terror'', would be shot without him acting in the film, even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the costume of the film's villain he once played, Clayface, he begins killing the actors playing characters he killed in the order and way they die in the film, along with someone who knew his identity. Last, he plans to murder the actor playing the Clayface killer. He is foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;Detective Comics #40&lt;/ref&gt;

He reappears after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fiancée, [[Julie Madison]]. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil his plans. A movie buff, Batman creator [[Bob Kane]] states that the character was partially inspired by the [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] version of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and that the name of the character comes from [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Basil Rathbone]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob Kane, ''Batman and Me'' (Foestfille, CA: Eclipse Books 1989), pg 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Detective Comics #49&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when the current Clayface Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. He even arranged for the remains of Matt Hagen to be gathered to make him a post-mortem member of the &quot;Mud Pack&quot; as the group called itself. Even though &quot;the Mud Pack&quot; is defeated, Karlo injects himself with samples from Preston Payne, Matt Hagen and Sondra Fuller, gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch; he becomes the self-declared &quot;Ultimate&quot; Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Origins'' #44&lt;/ref&gt; He is defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] by overloading his abilities, making him melt into the ground. He literally sinks into the Earth's crust when he loses control of his powers; he survives, however, and now his body sports crystals similar to [[quartz]] that endow him with greater powers. Karlo escapes his underground prison when [[Gotham City]] is struck by a great [[Batman: Cataclysm|cataclysm]]. He captures Batman and is about to kill him, but he gets into a feud with [[Mr. Freeze]] on who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader. Using that distraction, Batman soundly defeats both of them.

During the &quot;[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]&quot; storyline, Karlo holds [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. Poison Ivy eventually battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground. It appears that the Ultimate Clayface is destroyed in this battle, but has resurfaced as a member of the [[Villains United|Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Later, he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing [[Wonder Woman]] (a clay construct similar to him), giving him an amount of powers that bordered on invulnerability. While he is successful in absorbing some of the heroine's powers, causing her to regress to a teenage appearance resembling [[Donna Troy]], he is ultimately returned to normal when Wonder Woman and Donna were able to trick Clayface into entering a train carriage with Wonder Woman while she was disguised as Donna, Donna subsequently using the [[Lasso of Truth]] to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical [[centrifuge]], causing the clay Clayface had taken from Wonder Woman to split away from him and re-merge with Wonder Woman due to the differences between the two types of clay

Basil Karlo is among the members of the [[Injustice League]] and is among the villains seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He can be seen as a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains. In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', he triggers an explosion at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' under Libra's orders when [[Lex Luthor]] demands for Libra to do something that will draw [[Superman]] to them.&lt;ref&gt;Final Crisis #2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] attempted to control Clayface by implanting a device in his body. He escaped Black Mask but was captured and imprisoned by the Outsiders.

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe) as a part of &quot;[[Death of the Family]]&quot; storyline, Poison Ivy breaks Basil Karlo out of Arkham intent on marrying him.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #14&lt;/ref&gt; This turns out to be a ruse with Poison Ivy messing with Karlo's mind. He later sets out to seek revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

Karlo later returns with a new plan: to use his DNA-duplication abilities to impersonate Bruce Wayne and take control of Wayne Enterprises. He even guesses that Wayne is Batman's true identity. However, Batman plants false evidence to suggest that he anticipated Karlo's attempt to take his DNA and tricked him into taking a fake sample. Batman eventually stops him by trapping him in a security system that can only be deactivated with Karlo's original DNA, reasoning that Karlo has changed too much for his original DNA to be present in his system.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' (vol.2) #20&lt;/ref&gt;

In Detective Comics #934 (2016), Basil Karlo is recruited by Batman to join his new team of heroes to defend Gotham City from a new menace. This issue presents Clayface as more of a sympathetic character than seen in the past. Karlo accepts the offer to join Batman's new team.&lt;ref&gt;Detective Comics #934 Review at http://www.superheroreviews.com/detective_comics_934_comic_book_review/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matt Hagen===
[[File:Dc298.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Detective Comics'' #298. Matt Hagen as Clayface II.]]
The second Clayface, '''Matt Hagen''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen finds a mysterious [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] pool of [[protoplasm]] in a cave. Immersing himself in it by accident, he is transformed into a malleable [[clay]]-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desires. This is only a temporary effect, however, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers. His criminal activities attracted the attention of Batman and Robin. Batman discovered his weakness and defeated him.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Detective Comics #298&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen later escaped from prison and decided to investigate the protoplasmic substance that turned him into Clayface so that he can find a way to prolong his powers. Clayface posed as wealthy civilians of Gotham City in order to learn more about his criminal activities. Batman and Robin later confronted Clayface at his hideout where they used a combination of a freeze gun and the protoplasmic substance to defeat Clayface and return him to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #304&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen eventually breaks out of prison and uses the protoplasmic pool to become Clayface again. This time, Batman defeats Clayface by immersing himself in the protoplasm with the resulting battle causing Batman to destroy the cave that contained the protoplasmic pool.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #312&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later competes with [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] causing Batman, Robin, [[Batwoman]] and Batgirl to work to defeat both villains.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #159&lt;/ref&gt;

After escaping from Green Wells Maximum Security Prison upon having stashed some chemicals there, Clayface eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial proptoplasm only allows him five hours of Clayface powers compared to the full two days of the pool's. Clayface resumes his crime spree by stealing the priceless stamp collection of millionaire K.A. King and stealing the trophy that was to be given to Batman. Clayfaces' activities also attract the attention of Superman. Assuming the form of Superman, Clayface is evenly matched with him until Clayface smashes some bleachers to provide a diversion to get away. During Clayface's robbery, Batman used Kryptonite on Clayface's Superman form only for Clayface to get away by shapeshifting into a rocket. When Batman uses Red Kryptonite, it causes Clayface to go crazy. Clayface uses the X-Ray powers in his Superman form to see who Batman is. Before he can reveal who Batman is, Clayface's powers wore off causing him to regress back to Matt Hagen. Superman managed to save Clayface from the fall. Matt Hagen had lost the memory of Batman's secret identity as he is handed over to the Gotham City Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest #140&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] returns to Earth to plan his revenge on Superman, he goes on a rampage and blasts the walls to a prison where Matt Hagen was imprisoned. This gives Matt Hagen the opportunity to escape and head to one of his secret laboratories in order to regain his powers. He makes more of the synthetic formula that gives him shapeshifting powers for five hours. With [[Jimmy Olsen]] by his side, Batman works to track down Clayface while Robin works with Superman to catch Brainiac. This leads to a team-up between Clayface and Brainiac. While Superman and Robin managed to apprehend Brainiac, Clayface tries to escape only for his formula to wear off and enable Batman and Jimmy Olsen to apprehend him.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest'' #144&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later appears as a member of [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]]'s [[Anti-Justice League]] in order to capture the [[Justice League]]. They are defeated by the Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #443&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Hagen's blood was later obtained by Preston Payne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics #478&quot;&gt;''Detective Comics'' #478&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface later breaks out of prison and restores his powers. He kidnaps Lois Lane as part of a plot to destroy Batman and Superman. Both superheroes managed to rescue Lois Lane and defeat Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''World's Finest'' #264&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface is among the villains that fight Batman and [[Jason Todd|Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #526&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, Matt Hagen is ultimately killed by a shadow demon.&lt;ref&gt;Crisis on Infinite Earths #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayface appeared in Limbo alongside other dead villains as part of a plan to return to the living, only to be defeated by [[Hawk and Dove]], the [[Teen Titans]] and Jeb Stuart's [[Haunted Tank]]. The imposter [[Etrigan the Demon]] offered them a way out through another portal, but he was merely toying with the dead villains. When he sent them through a portal, it turned out to be an entrance to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawk and Dove Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

During the &quot;Mud Pack&quot; storyline, the other villains who use the name Clayface gather Hagen's remains and make him a post-mortem member of their gang.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #604&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preston Payne===
[[File:cf3.jpg|thumb|Preston Payne as Clayface III battles Batman. From ''Detective Comics'' #479.]]
The third Clayface, '''Preston Payne''', first appeared at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #477 before making his first full appearance in #478. Suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Payne works at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] searching for a cure. He obtains a sample of the then-living Matt Hagen's blood, and isolates an [[enzyme]] which he introduces into his own bloodstream. Although he is briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect is short-lived: while on a date, his flesh begins to melt, and when he touches his horrified girlfriend, she completely melts. Payne builds an [[exoskeleton]] anti-melting suit to prevent himself from touching anyone, but he learns that he needs to spread his melting contagion onto others to survive (he feels pain if he does not melt anyone). During this time his mental health starts to slip as he falls in love with a wax mannequin he names &quot;Helena&quot;, thinking she is the only woman immune to his touch. After another breakdown, he thinks Helena enjoys watching men &quot;fighting over her&quot; when he battles Batman yet again in front of the wax doll. Although he does not give her up, he keeps her in [[Arkham Asylum]], saying &quot;we're both too polite to admit [[divorce]], but she cannot live forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective Comics #478&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

When [[Swamp Thing]] visits Arkham Asylum, he witnesses Payne in an argument with &quot;Helena&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' Vol. 2 #52&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. R. Hutton takes a nightshift at Arkham Asylum in order to do research for his new book detailing superhuman psychology. He keeps a close watch on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. During this time, he sees Clayface spending intimate time with &quot;Helena&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Swamp Thing'' Vol. 2 #66&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events of &quot;The Mud Pack&quot;, Sondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface, begins masquerading as the hero [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] and visits Payne at Arkham. That same night, he gets into an argument with &quot;Helena&quot; and unintentionally knocks her head off. Believing he has killed her, Payne goes on a rampage until subdued in a nearby swamp by the asylum guards. Fuller, who is still using Looker's appearance and powers, rescues him and influences him to follow Basil Karlo's commands. Karlo ultimately betrays Fuller, and takes samples of her and Payne's blood to inject into himself. Payne finally breaks free of Fuller's control, and is about to kill her when she admits how sorry she is for using him. The two fall in love and go on to live together, leading to Fuller becoming [[pregnant]] with their child, Cassius.

Preston acquires medicine to control his pain and now feels the &quot;hunger&quot; only in his mind. It is also revealed that he was [[child abuse|abused]] by his parents.

A stunted, emaciated Preston Payne appears in the graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Dave McKean]]. He is used to metaphorically represent [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Payne next appears in the ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' miniseries, having been coerced into working for [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]], who had threatened the life of his son. Prometheus had further mutated Payne giving him back his old shapeshifting abilities and had him act as a decoy for the [[Justice League]]. When the ruse was discovered, an explosive device planted inside Payne's body detonated. It is unknown if he survived the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sondra Fuller===
The fourth Clayface, '''Sondra Fuller''' (also known as '''Lady Clay'''), first appeared in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (volume 1) #21. She is a member of Strikeforce Kobra who is transformed into a shape-changer by her employer [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]'s technologies. She agreed to going through with the process because she hates her own face.&lt;ref&gt;Outsiders #21&lt;/ref&gt;

She possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but they are permanent, without the requirement for a source of protoplasm. She can additionally copy any special powers of the being she is mimicking. She is defeated by the Outsiders.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Later, after the Mud Pack forms and battles Batman, Fuller falls in love with Preston Payne. After Clayface-Prime (Karlo) is defeated, Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller get married and they have a child named Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne, a play on boxer [[Muhammad Ali]]'s birth name. After [[Abattoir (comics)|Abbatoir]] kidnaps the child, the couple get into a fight involving [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael/Batman]]. Batman eventually defeated them both, and Fuller was put into custody.

===The Mud Pack===
Before the debut appearances of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, Lady Clay and Clayface III team up, breaking Clayface I out of prison and futilely revive Clayface II. Together, the quartet form &quot;the Mud Pack&quot;. Clayface I later copies the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of samples of Clayface II, III and Lady Clay, becoming the &quot;Ultimate Clayface&quot;. The three battle, and are defeated by Batman in ''Detective Comics #604-607''.&lt;ref&gt;Detective Comics #604-607&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne===
[[File:Clayface.jpg|right|thumb|Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne as the fifth Clayface]]
After the Mud Pack, Payne and Fuller fall in love and eventually have a child together named '''Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne''', who becomes the fifth Clayface and debuted in ''Batman #550''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman #550&quot;&gt;Batman #550&lt;/ref&gt; The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The name &quot;Cassius&quot; is a pun on &quot;Cassius Clay&quot;, the birth name of boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman #550&quot;/&gt;

If a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human, becoming a '''Claything''', the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do to perform such an action is think about it.

In an issue of ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', Cassius is depicted as having the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but can only stay in Clayface mode while awake (a similar trait shared by [[Plasmus]] in the [[Teen Titans (TV Series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] (2003-2006)).&lt;ref&gt;Batman: Gotham After Midnight #3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Cassius attacks the National Guard on the roadblock, but when he was approached by [[General Immortus]]' team, he is able to recognize one of the team, [[Human Flame]]. Cassius attacks and blames him for [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] enslaving the Earth. The Justice League arrives to end the fight as Human Flame and General Immortus' team teleport away, leaving Cassius to be captured. After the League interrogates him, he is taken to FBI vehicles, but the measures to contain him are proven useless; Cassius breaks loose, escaping into the desert.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis Aftermath: Run'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dr. Peter &quot;Claything&quot; Malley===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] --&gt;
The sixth Clayface, also known as '''Claything''', also debuted in ''Batman #550''. Claything is created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with a DEO ([[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) scientist, '''Dr. Peter Malley'''. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything is destroyed and his remains are stored at the DEO Headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman #550&quot;/&gt;

===Todd Russell===
The seventh Clayface debuted in ''Catwoman Vol. 3, #1'' (January 2002), but is not actually shown until ''Catwoman Vol. 3, #4'' (May 2002). This version of Clayface is not named until ''Catwoman Vol. 3, #44''. Having the power to change into virtually any shape and size, he preys upon prostitutes in Gotham's East End until [[Catwoman]] is able to capture his shriveled body inside of a freezer. There are very few background details given about the seventh Clayface's past. He was in the army, suffered injuries, and was subsequently experimented on (possibly by the DEO) before losing most of his memory and discovering his new powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com/2009/11/modern-age-year-eighteen.html |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Eighteen) Part One |publisher=Therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his capture, he is held captive and further experimented upon for almost two years at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] in Gotham before being freed by Catwoman.&lt;ref&gt;Catwoman #42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Williams===

The eighth Clayface debuted in ''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #60 (February 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com/2010/03/modern-age-year-eighteen-part-three.html |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Eighteen) Part Three |publisher=Therealbatmanchronoproject.blogspot.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Johnny Williams''' is introduced as a former firefighter in Gotham who is transformed into a clay-based creature by an explosion in a chemical plant. He first discovers his transformation after he accidentally kills a [[prostitute]]; horrified and stricken with guilt, he plans to commit [[suicide]]. Just then, he is approached by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]], who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do their bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) and an adult [[Jason Todd]], to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne.&lt;ref&gt;Batman #614&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batman #617-618&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated. Knowing that he is going to die, he offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself in his death, also ensuring that [[Alfred Pennyworth]] is cleared of murder.&lt;ref&gt;Batman: Gotham Knight #69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clayface of Japan===
The ninth Clayface debuted in ''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 1 #6 (June 2011) as part of ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.therealbatmanchronologyproject.com/the-modern-age/post-year-one-era-20-23/year-twenty-three-p-1/ |title=The Real Batman Chronology Project: Modern Age (Year Twenty-Three Part One) |publisher=therealbatmanchronologyproject.com |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman tasks Batman Japan (Jiro Osamu) to fight '''The Clayface of Japan''' about two-and-a-half months into his [[Batman Incorporated]] venture.&lt;ref&gt;Batman Incorporated Vol. 1 #6&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about this Clayface, although he resembles all the previous Clayfaces and seems to have their same power set. Presumably, this Clayface, as a rival to Osamu, is a native to Japan. Batman states that this Clayface is a newcomer, a [[samurai]], and operates in or around [[Hokkaido]].&lt;ref&gt;Batman Incorporated Vol. 2 #0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clayface Clones===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a villain named Jeffrey Bode makes several short-lived clones of Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''Deathstroke'' Vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Each of the Clayfaces has a different power with the exception of their shapeshifting ability.

* In earlier appearances, Basil Karlo had no powers. In recent comics, Basil Karlo's body is made out of mud upon taking the DNA of Clayface II, Clayface III, and Lady Clay, enabling him to gain the combined powers of both. In ''The New 52'', these are improved to a level in which he can mimic the DNA of others.
* Matt Hagen had temporary shape-shifting, and voice-shifting, and a body constituted by living mud which he can divide or change tone at will. Hagen had to re-immerse himself in the protoplasm to recharge his powers every 48 hours or else he would regress back to his human form.
* Preston Payne originally had shape-shifting powers, yet ended up gaining the ability to melt people with his touch. He has super-strength from his exo-skeleton anti-melting suit. Preston's shape-shifting ability was later restored by Prometheus.
* Sondra Fuller has shape-shifting powers and power duplication.
* Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne has the powers of both his parents. If a piece of him is separated from his mass, it can develop some consciousness of its own and even &quot;bond&quot; with a human to transform them into a &quot;Claything&quot;.
* Dr. Peter Malley had the same powers as Cassius, but could also melt people without touching them.
* Todd Russell had shape-shifting powers.
* Johnny Williams had shape-shifting powers.

==Other versions==
===Earth-9===
The [[Earth-9]] version of Clayface is featured in [[Tangent Comics]]' ''Superman's Reign'' series. This version is a shapeshifter like the mainstream versions, but his base form is that of a hulking, misshapened human with melted skin.&lt;ref&gt;''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, a version of Clayface is a member of [[Deathstroke]]'s pirates after being broken out of a floating prison by Deathstroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; During attacks by [[Aquaman]] and [[Ocean Master]], Clayface is pushed by Aquaman into the water apparently killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Deathstroke and the Curse of the Ravager'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Injustice: Gods Among Us===
The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in Year Two of the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' comic.

===Batman: Arkham Knight===
In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'''s prequel comic series, samples of Basil Karlo's mud were acquired by various parties including [[Simon Stagg]], who created &quot;Project: Meta&quot;, and [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] which he used for his face to hide his cosmetic surgery scars. Karlo also appeared during one of Joker's fantasies, and briefly during one of Batman's simulations for Robin. It was also revealed that Karlo is still alive within the mud collected by GCPD, but unable to take form again because of the Lazarus Particles mixed with his mud and the explosion from the generator.

===Batman '66===
In ''[[Batman '66]]'' (which is based off the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV series]]), the Basil Karlo name was used for the true identity of False-Face. In issue #23, False-Face gets his hands on a shapeshifting formula that transforms him into Clayface.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman '66'' #23&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===

====Live action====
* A character that resembles the Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears among the attacking criminals in the animated [[opening credits]] of the sixties ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, but the villain never actually appeared on the show itself and was instead replaced with the lesser known but similar-sounding masked master of disguise called [[List of minor DC Comics characters#False Face|False Face]].
* Clayface made an appearance in the 12th episode of the short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' TV series, portrayed by [[Kirk Baltz]]. This version of Clayface is a sculptor who is [[schadenfreude|inspired by other people's pain]]. Like other versions, he is a shapeshifter but his powers are explained to come from taking a special formula specifically tailored by a crooked scientist to work with his [[DNA]]. In this series, he is hired by the Joker to kill [[Catwoman]]. His son '''Chris Cassius''' (portrayed by [[Ian Reed Kesler]]) can turn people into clay after stealing and taking his father's formula, making his powers similar to the Preston Payne version of Clayface and his own son Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne. Chris is eventually defeated by [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle]].
* Basil Karlo appears in ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[Brian McManamon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/04/05/gotham-to-introduce-clayface-mr-freeze-and-mad-hatter-in-season-/|title=Gotham To Introduce Clayface, Mr. Freeze and Mad Hatter in Season Two|publisher=Comic Book.com|last= Burlingame|first=Russ|date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/03/18/exclusive-brian-mcmanamon-cast-as-clayface-in-gotham/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Brian McManamon Cast As Basil Karlo AKA Clayface In Gotham|publisher=Comc Book.com|last=Jayson|first=Jay|date=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McManamon |first1=Brian |url=https://twitter.com/BrianMcManamon/status/708425976460546049 |title=&quot;Psyched to be guest starring (&amp; bald!) in an upcoming episode of @Gotham with the gracious &amp; talented @ben_mckenzie&quot; |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2016-03-11 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is a deceased actor who was revived from the dead by [[Hugo Strange]] and Ethel Peabody at the underground Indian Hill facility. Thanks to the octopod DNA in him, Basil can stretch his face. In the episode &quot;[[Wrath of the Villains: A Legion of Horribles]]&quot;, after James Gordon is apprehended by Hugo Strange's orderlies, Karlo's head is placed in a special head mold which Hugo Strange then uses to help shape Karlo's face to resemble James Gordon's face. One of Strange's minions then topped it off with a wig to finally match Gordon. Gordon looks in shock as Karlo started to match Gordon's voice. In the episode &quot;[[Wrath of the Villains: Transference]]&quot;, Basil as Gordon confronts the authorities outside of Arkham Asylum and tells them that there was nothing incriminating there while asking for a ride back to the Gotham City Police Department. His ruse has Harvey Bullock and Alfred Pennyworth mildly suspicious, until Barbara Kean sees through it. In the episode &quot;Mad City: Ghosts,&quot; Basil Karlo returns where he is used by Edward Nygma to help break Mayor Oswald Cobblepot's mind by posing as Elijah Van Dahl's ghost.

====Animation====
* Clayface's first animated appearance was in [[Filmation]]'s 1970s TV series called ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]] and later by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. This was the Matt Hagen version and he must apply his special potion daily to keep his Clayface powers. In this show, he often took on the forms of animals. 
:In &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, Clayface in his true form Matt Hagen forces former criminal-turned-acrobat Kit Martin to help him in exchange that he will not tell his boss of his criminal record. The plot involves posing as Batman in order to kidnap the Arabian Oil Minister Basil Oram. They disguise themselves as Batman and Robin, capture Oram and escape in a special shapeshifting vehicle. Clayface later calls [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], stating that he will return Oram and the blueprints for an oil-finding device in exchange for $10,000.000 by the end of the first hour. Clayface then orchestrates a car accident that knocks out [[Batman]] and then stows away in the [[Batmobile]] in order to infiltrate the [[Batcave]]. Clayface then discovers that Batman has amnesia and uses this advantage to find out Batman's secret identity, but his plan is foiled when [[Bat-Mite]] distracts him long enough for the Bat-Computer to create an antidote for Batman's amnesia. Clayface sneak out of the Batcave disguised as a rabbit with Bat-Mite in pursuit while [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] learn why Kit is involved with Clayface's kidnapping plot. Batman used the Bat-Boat to pursue Clayface when he escapes into the water in the form of a dolphin. After Kit returns the blueprints to Commissioner Gordon, Robin and Batgirl learn from Kit that he was to deliver a &quot;medicine&quot; to Clayface before midnight. When Clayface's shapeshifting wears off, he reverts back to Matt Hagen and begins to drown as Hagen cannot swim, until Batman saves him and hands him over to the police. 
:In &quot;Curses! Oiled Again&quot;, Clayface collaborates with [[Catwoman]] to steal a shipment of oil bound for [[Gotham City]] during a cold snap. They also plan to steal the country's oil supply. When Batman and Robin scout out each of the storage tanks in the south side and the waterfront, Batman finds Catwoman and Clayface at the oil storage tanks on the waterfront and is led into a trap where Clayface attacks Batman in the form of a snake. Catwoman appears and shows Batman how she and Clayface have been draining the oil from Gotham City. Batman breaks free from Clayface when Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite arrive. Clayface turns into an eagle to get Catwoman away from Batman. Catwoman and Clayface manage to lose Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Bat-Mite in a car chase when the Kitty Car jumps over Batgirl. Catwoman and Clayface intercept a call between Batman and Commissioner Gordon revolving around the oil supertanker arriving in Gotham City. Catwoman and Clayface manage to steal some of the oil and escape in their submarine as Catwoman flees in her plane. Clayface turns into a whale in order to attack Batman and Robin. Batman and Robin net Clayface, who turns into a flying fish to get out, only to be caught in a smaller net by Robin. In the two-part episode &quot;Have an Evil Day&quot;, Zarbor enlists [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], Catwoman and Clayface to keep the Dynamic Duo busy while he steals America's nuclear power plants.
* The [[DC Animated Universe]] featured the Matt Hagen version of Clayface, voiced by [[Golden Globe]] winner [[Ron Perlman]]. 
** Clayface is introduced in the critically acclaimed 1990s series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', with Matt Hagen having several of Basil Karlo's aspects as well.[[File:Clayface-Batman.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Matt Hagen as Clayface as seen in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.]] In the episode &quot;Feat of Clay&quot; (written by veteran comic book writer [[Marv Wolfman]]), Matt Hagen was a past-his-prime actor [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a horrible car accident. While recovering in a burn clinic, corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett]] makes him a test subject for the compound 'Renuyu' that he promises will immediately restore his youthful good looks. In exchange, Hagen must use the chemical to commit crimes for Daggett. Matt tries to resist but is forced to comply as the Renuyu chemical is extremely addictive. After Hagen botches an attack on [[Lucius Fox]] while disguised as Bruce Wayne, Daggett cuts his supply off. Hagen attempts to steal a large quantity of Renuyu from Daggett's compound but is caught and Daggett's men pour an entire canister of the compound down his throat and leave him for dead. Rather than kill him, the [[drug overdose|overdose]] saturates every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in his body, turning him into a bulky and misshapen clay-like form of Clayface. For short periods of time, he can shapeshift into anything or anybody he wishes. Clayface tries to get [[revenge]] on Daggett, but [[Batman]] stops the villain. When caught, Clayface fakes his death (the body the morgue has turns out to be a hollow shell which dries up and breaks apart). The episode &quot;Mudslide&quot; shows Clayface reappearing and revealing that he has been in hiding and that his body is beginning to deteriorate. He is restored to a semblance of health by Dr. Stella Bates (voiced by [[Pat Musick]]), a former medical adviser during Hagen's career who fell in love with Matt. Batman tracks him down and prevents Clayface's treatment. Clayface and Batman then fight on a cliff during a rainstorm above an ocean. They both fall, and hang onto the cliff. Batman attempts to save Clayface, but his body absorbs too much rain to hold itself and he falls into the ocean where he dissolves.
** Clayface returns in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. [[File:Clayface3.jpg||thumb|right|225px|Matt Hagen as Clayface in ''The New Batman Adventures'']]Clayface makes a brief appearance in the pilot episode &quot;Holiday Knights&quot; where he separates himself into various little boys to steal items during a [[Christmas Eve]] rush. Revealing himself, he attacks Detectives [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] and [[Renee Montoya]] but is defeated by [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. In the episode &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, Clayface returns barely alive after continuing to dissolve. Clayface's remains drift near a pipe leaking strange chemicals into the ocean which combine with Clayface's remains to restore his strength. Still weakened, Clayface sends a portion of himself which takes a little girl's form later named 'Annie' (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) to see if the city is still safe for him to resurface. Annie unexpectedly develops an individual personality, wandering around Gotham with no memory of who she is and encounters [[Tim Drake|Robin]]. As Robin develops an affection for Annie, Clayface poses as the girl's [[child abuse|abusive]] father, committing various robberies in order to make a living in Gotham's sewers. Eventually, Clayface recovers, cornering Robin and Annie, to which Annie allows herself to be reabsorbed (effectively killing her) to save Robin. Enraged by Annie's 'death', Robin almost kills Clayface with gallons of [[solvent]], but [[Batman]] intervenes and stops and the villain is arrested and imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. When [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] lists the charges Clayface is accused of, Robin quietly adds murder as one of them.
** Clayface is also featured in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. In the episode &quot;Secret Society&quot;, he is revealed to have been captured, separated and sealed into several [[biological hazard|biohazard]] canisters by [[Morgan Edge]]. The [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] attack Edge's mansion to free Clayface and offers membership. Now less aggressive and psychopathic than before, Clayface is reluctant at first but [[Gorilla Grodd]] promises to find a way to revert Clayface back to Matt Hagen yet allow him to keep his powers. However, Clayface is defeated along with the rest of the group after the [[Wally West|Flash]] and [[Hawkgirl]] stuff him with fireworks and set them off.

[[File:Clayface of Tragedy.jpg|right|thumb|Ethan Bennett as Clayface in ''The Batman'']]
[[File:KarloClayface.jpg|right|thumb|Basil Karlo as Clayface in ''The Batman''.]]
* There are two versions of Clayface that appear on the aughts TV series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'':
** The first incarnation is '''Ethan Bennett''' (voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]), a detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] and Bruce Wayne's best friend. Bennett turns into Clayface in the two-part season finale &quot;The Rubber Face of Comedy&quot; and &quot;Clayface of Tragedy&quot; when he inhales a dose of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s 'Joker Putty'. After a session of extensive [[brainwashing]] and traumatizing, Ethan is rescued by [[Batman]] and Detective [[Ellen Yin]]. After publicly denouncing Chief Angel Rojas's claims about Batman and getting suspended for it, Bennett mutates into a featureless gray clay-like figure and tries to look for help, scaring away the locals, though Ethan manages to change back into his original form with practice. While trying to murder Rojas, Clayface deals with Yin and Batman. In the second season, Bennett appears primarily as Clayface. In the episode &quot;Meltdown&quot;, Clayface is captured and put on trial for his crimes. Despite being released on probation, the temptations of being a criminal were too severe for Bennett. In the episode &quot;Grundy's Night&quot;, Clayface impersonates [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] in order to loot the city on [[Halloween]] but is ultimately stopped by Batman. In the fourth season, Bennett has a change of heart while Karlo appears. In the episode &quot;Clayfaces&quot;, Bennett seems to have finally reformed by tracking down and capturing Joker, disguising himself as Joker's henchmen Punch and Judy. He hands Joker over to the police without using excessive force and turns himself in to the authorities. Now in [[Arkham Asylum]], Bennett wants to return working as a police officer even as Clayface.
:* The second incarnation introduced is the Basil Karlo incarnation (making his animated debut), voiced by [[Wallace Langham]] (in &quot;Clayfaces&quot;) and by [[Lex Lang]] (in &quot;The Batman/Superman Story&quot;). He is an untalented actor who is repeatedly turned down in auditions for a dog food commercial when he hears that Bennett is about to be cured. Karlo breaks into Wayne Industries and drinks a refined, purified sample of the same [[mutagen]] that Bennett was exposed to. This successfully turns Basil into a new version of Clayface and he gives himself a more conventional appearance. After being rejected once again, Karlo snaps and uses his Clayface powers to attack the people who rejected him. Karlo initially believes this would be the death of his career but he then sees that being a [[supervillain]] has made him a celebrity covered on nearly every channel, as well as show his previous movie ''The Revenge of The Atomic Clone''. As Karlo was wreaking havoc, Bennett resorts to escaping from Arkham. Bennett tracks down and battles Karlo with the aid of Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. Bennett then restraining Karlo down while Batman administers the successful antidote, thus both Bennett and Karlo are cured and returned to Arkham. Ethan planned to finish his sentence. Visited by Bruce, Ethan states that they should play basketball one day. Since the antidote finally cured all of his mutated cells, Ethan will eventually be free. However, the episode's final scene shows that Karlo has retained his powers. The episode &quot;Artifacts&quot; depicts 20 years into the future with Bennett reinstated into the GCPD as Chief of Police. In the final season's &quot;The Batman/Superman Story&quot;, Karlo reappears when Clayface and [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] are hired by [[Lex Luthor]] to kidnap [[Lois Lane]] as bait for a trap to lure in [[Superman]] so that [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Mr. Freeze]] can attack Superman at once. Superman defeats the villains with Batman and Robin's help but Clayface escapes. Clayface later fights Batman and Robin in [[LexCorp]]'s Gotham headquarters and ends up defeated.

* The ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode &quot;Joker: The Vile and the Villainous&quot; features a portrait of the Preston Payne version of Clayface in the villain bar where Batman's Rogues Gallery hangs out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formspring.me/IdiotStyle/q/186901759489244181 |title=Formspring forum thread |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. In &quot;Downtime&quot;, he is seen at the beginning where he overpowers the entire team and is about to kill [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] until Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a taser, which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle. He was later taken to Arkham Asylum. In &quot;Happy New Year&quot;, Clayface encounters [[Miss Martian]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] in the sewers, where he attacks Superboy with the same tactics he used before. By this point he has become immune to the tasers [[Tim Drake|Robin]] uses, but Superboy uses a special pill to freeze Clayface. He is then returned to Arkham.

===Film===
* The Flashpoint version of Clayface appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]''. He is part of [[Deathstroke]]'s pirate crew that fights [[Aquaman]]'s army until he is killed by [[Ocean Master]].
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Monster Mayhem]]'', voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]. Clayface has joined [[Joker (character)|The Joker]]'s gang of monsters to wreak mayhem on Gotham City.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Mech vs. Mutants]]'', voiced again by Dave B. Mitchell. Clayface, [[Killer Croc]], [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]], and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] are freed from Arkham by [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[the Penguin]]. Freeze uses a serum to turn Chemo and Croc into giant monsters. Meanwhile, the treacherous Penguin enlists Clayface and Bane to help with a coup against Freeze. Penguin injects them with the serum and Bane throw Freeze across Gotham. Clayface goes after Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] but the serum turns Clayface into a lava monster. Using a freeze ray developed by Freeze, Robin, the Flash, [[Man-Bat]], and Nightwing Clayface is frozen. However Clayface is accidentally freed by some children and, back to his original form, escaped into the sewer.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', voiced by [[Kate Micucci]].

===Video games===
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears as the final boss of [[Sega CD]] version of ''[[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin]]'', although he takes on the appearance of [[Rupert Thorne]] (who was on vacation at the time) throughout the majority of the game, having hired other villains such as Joker, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Riddler]] to stall Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. He is fought in an aerial battle while fleeing in a helicopter from the [[Batplane|Batwing]]. In the end, Batman damages the helicopter and it crashes into a bridge. Clayface falls into the river below and dissolves. Of note, this is the only time in the entire [[DC Animated Universe]] in which Dick Grayson comes into conflict with Clayface. The game's cutscenes have since come to be known as the infamous &quot;Lost Episode&quot; of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', though it is not considered canonical to the DC Animated Universe.
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface appears on the final level of [[SNES]] version of ''[[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin]]'' as one of several villains trying to take down Batman.
* The Matt Hagen version of Clayface is the second boss of ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]'' again voiced by Ron Perlman. Along with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], he is manipulated by Sin Tzu into escaping Arkham Asylum and challenging Batman. Clayface takes over a chemical factory, intending to mutate Gotham's citizens into clay like himself, hoping that this will leave them more likely to search for a cure.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He is a lieutenant of the [[Riddler]]. His look and structure is that of the Matt Hagen version from Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures (though his biography says it's Basil Karlo)&lt;ref&gt;''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See &quot;''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery&quot;, ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; His actions and mannerisms suggest a low level of intelligence. In the DS version, he is Matt Hagen instead of Basil Karlo, despite having the same design as Karlo.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface can be seen in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]''. Although never seen in his true form, he is shown changing into various other game characters while asking to be let out of his cell (behind a strong glass wall smeared in clay). His biography states it is Basil Karlo, although the presence of a mannequin in the cell hints at Preston Payne's relationship with &quot;Helena&quot;. His profile is obtained by scanning him (revealing that he has no visible skeleton unlike all other scanned characters), solving Riddler's riddle: &quot;A case of mistaken identity?&quot; After he is revealed, he stays in the form of Commissioner Gordon for the remainder of the game, and only laughs when the player tries talking to him. When the player returns to the Penitentiary section and finds Warden [[Quincy Sharp]] gone with the final Arkham Chronicles enscribed on the floor, Clayface as Commissioner Gordon states that the warden left in a hurry. He is also one of the villains who is listed on the party list. It is stated that while during therapy, he likes to constantly turn into the Doctor interviewing him, for no other reason than to annoy her, which he finds amusing.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Rick D. Wasserman]]. He is seen present throughout the game, posing as a healthy Joker to draw attention away from the dying Clown Prince of Crime. He is also the game's [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]], where he reverts to his true form for the fight. Scanning a poster of The Terror (a reference to Karlo's first appearance) outside the Monarch Theatre reveals that Clayface had escaped Arkham Island after the events of the previous game by posing as Quincy Sharp, and had been on the run from [[Hugo Strange]] ever since. While Clayface does pose as Joker for most of the game, the only indicator of the ruse is that Clayface does not have any bones, which can be seen during the Joker boss fight. The plot is revealed after Clayface-Joker is impaled and supposedly killed by [[Talia al Ghul]]. Batman then realizes what has happened, only for Talia to be shot and killed by the real Joker. Finally Clayface reveals himself and takes the cure for the Titan toxin, causing Batman to be highly shocked as Karlo was not even an inmate of Arkham City. Clayface says that he joined up with Joker for the chance to play &quot;the role of a lifetime&quot; before brutally attacking Batman with a series of shapeshifting attacks and spawning miniature Clayfaces. Joker destroys the floor of the Monarch Theatre, sending the combatants into the Lazarus Chamber. There, Batman defeats Clayface and retrieves the cure using freezing grenades and Talia's sword.
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Benjamin Jansen]]. He attacks Gotham S.C.U. until the players activate a containment unit to trap Clayface. In the villain campaign, the players free Clayface from his containment unit. The players also confront Clayface again in the Old Gotham Subway duo instance, where he first appears taking the shape of Two-Face. After defeating him, Two-Face tells the player through communicator that &quot;the Penguin must have promised him a cure for his unfortunate condition. He has not yet learned that the cure is worse than the disease.&quot;
* Although he does not make an appearance as Clayface, Basil Karlo is referenced in ''[[Gotham City Impostors]]''. There are posters on both sides of the theatre that depict a masked man, above of which are the words &quot;Basil Karlo in...&quot;
* The Basil Karlo version of Clayface makes an appearance in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a boss fight and unlockable character, found in an alley behind Gotham Bank. Before the fight, he remarks on how his mother always told him he could &quot;be anything&quot; (which after gaining his powers is, of course, true).
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', posters for a Basil Karlo comedy are seen next to a theater.
* Several versions of Clayface are referenced in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. The first is Basil Karlo, who is referenced in posters that say &quot;Basil Karlo is The Terror&quot; that can be found in Panessa Studios. Several are referenced in a poster of a movie named &quot;Dark Interlude&quot; starring Matthew Hagen and Stella Bates (a reference to the character from the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode &quot;Mudslide&quot;), found in the Clock Tower, as well as other co-stars Karlo, Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller.

===Miscellaneous===
* Issue 12 of the comic book tie-in to ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (which serves as a prequel to the episode &quot;Downtime&quot;) reveals Matt Hagen/Clayface's back story as a mediocre member of the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]] who romances [[Talia al Ghul]]. After her father [[Ra's al Ghul]] reluctantly gives the couple his blessing, Hagen reveals that he has [[cancer]] and uses her to heal himself in the [[Lazarus Pit]]. After he is submerged, Talia takes revenge on him by locking him there for months. After Ra's al Ghul uses the pit, Hagen emerges mutated and insane and attacks Talia only to be subdued by Ra's al Ghul and Sensei. After convincing Clayface to sleep, Ra's al Ghul uses him against Batman in Gotham upon having Sensei dropping Clayface off in Gotham while demanding an explanation from Talia about how Clayface came to be. Clayface's attack leads up to the team's battle with him in the sewers. In issue 13, Clayface secretly studies [[Young Justice|The Team]] and takes down Superboy, Miss Martian, [[Kid Flash]], and Robin in each trap. Before Clayface can finish off Aqualad, Batman intervenes and quickly subdues him with a stronger taser which causes Clayface to dissolve into a puddle.

'''Sandor Clegane''', nicknamed '''The Hound''', is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Sandor is the younger brother of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], from the fictional kingdom of [[Westeros]]. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998), ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000) and ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005).

Sandor Clegane is portrayed by [[Rory McCann]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web|title=HBO: Game of Thrones: Sandor Clegane (&quot;The Hound&quot;): Bio|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/sandor-clegane/index.html|website=HBO|accessdate=27 December 2015|ref=HBOCast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Sandor Clegane, known as the Hound, is a retainer to [[House Lannister]] and the younger brother of [[Gregor Clegane]], a.k.a. The Mountain. He is regarded as one of the most dangerous and skilled fighters in [[Westeros]].  His face is distinguished by gruesome burn scars, which he received as a child when his brother pushed his head into a [[brazier]]. Consequently, he fears fire and hates his brother. He is also scornful of knight's vows, as his brother is a knight. He is described as a tormented man driven by anger and hate, aspiring only to kill his brother.

== Overview ==
Sandor Clegane is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as [[Ned Stark]], [[Sansa Stark]], and [[Arya Stark]]. Sandor is mostly a background character in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide |work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Sandor Clegane is played by the Scottish actor [[Rory McCann]] in the television adaptation of the series of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/game-of-thrones-meet-the-hound-scottish-actor-rory-mccann/#/0 |title='Game of Thrones': The Hound |work=Herocomplex |date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCann has received positive reviews for his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-rory-mccann-on-the-hound-and-season-four-20140407|title=Sandor Clegane: 'Game of Thrones' actor talks |journal=Rolling Stone |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storylines ==
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Clegane supporters.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing three black dogs on a field of yellow.|Coat of arms of House Clegane]]
===In the books===
In ''A Game of Thrones'', he acts as bodyguard and servant to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Prince Joffrey Baratheon]], who calls him Dog. He is named a knight of Joffrey's Kingsguard in ''A Clash of Kings'' and is often assigned to guard Sansa, trying to protect her from Joffrey's abuse. He flees King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater, due to the widespread use of wildfire, a fictional substance similar to [[Greek fire]].

In ''A Storm of Swords'', he is captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners which sentences him to [[trial by combat]]. Sandor prevails and is set free. He later kidnaps Arya to ransom her to her brother [[Robb Stark]] and hopes to earn a place in Robb's service. He takes her to [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#The Twins|the Twins]], where Robb is attending a wedding. However, just as they arrive, [[House Frey|the Freys]] begin slaughtering [[House Stark|the Starks]]. Sandor and Arya escape. They encounter three of Gregor's men at an inn, and Sandor is seriously injured in the ensuing fight. Arya abandons him to his apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2013/10/17/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-storm-of-swords-part-48/ |title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 48 |work=Tor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned a few times in ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'' (2005), where the Elder Brother mentions to Brienne of Tarth that he found Sandor, who is now &quot;at rest&quot;. However, the appearance of a mute gravedigger who matches Sandor physically and the Elder Brother's refusal to confirm if Sandor is dead imply that he may still be alive.

===In the show===

====Season 1====
Clegane accompanies the royal court on Robert Baratheon's visit to Winterfell. On the way back to King's Landing, Joffrey falsely accuses a butcher's boy, Mycah, of threatening him, and Clegane kills the boy, attracting the hatred of Mycah's friend Arya Stark. During the Tourney of the Hand, Sandor's sadistic elder brother Gregor tries to kill Ser Loras Tyrell after he is unhorsed, but Sandor defends Loras from Gregor until Robert orders the men to stop fighting. When Ned Stark accuses Joffrey of being a bastard born of incest and orders his arrest, Clegane assists the Lannister soldiers in the subsequent purge of the Stark household and Sansa Stark's capture, though he later comforts Sansa when Joffrey orders her beaten. With Joffrey's ascension to the throne, Clegane is named to the Kingsguard to replace the ousted Ser Barristan Selmy, though Clegane refuses to take his knight's vows.

====Season 2====
Sandor continues to defend Sansa, including by covering her after Joffrey orders her stripped and rescuing her from being gang-raped during the King's Landing riots. He participates in the Battle of the Blackwater against Stannis' Baratheon's forces, but is visibly horrified when Tyrion Lannister uses wildfire to incinerate much of Stannis' fleet, and ultimately deserts after witnessing a man burning alive in the battle. Before he leaves, he offers to take Sansa north to Winterfell, but she ultimately refuses.

====Season 3====
[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Arya's and the Hound's costumes.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=The costumes worn by Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane|The costumes worn by [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV series Game of Thrones.]]
In the Riverlands, Clegane is arrested by the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of knights and soldiers sent by Eddard Stark to kill his brother Gregor and restore order to the Riverlands. While being transported to their stronghold, he meets other members of the Brotherhood who are traveling with Arya Stark, and tells them of her true identity. At the Brotherhood's hideout, their leader Ser Beric Dondarrion accuses Clegane of being a murderer; though Clegane asserts that the murders were done in order to protect Joffrey, Arya testifies that he had killed Mycah despite the boy not harming Joffrey. Ser Beric sentences Clegane to a trial by combat, which Clegane wins to secure his freedom, although Ser Beric is immediately resurrected by the Red Priest Thoros of Myr. Clegane later captures Arya, intending to ransom her to King Robb Stark at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at The Twins. However, as they arrive at the Twins the Freys turn on the Starks and attack them, and Clegane and Arya barely escape the massacre.

====Season 4====
With the rest of House Stark believed dead and the Riverlands now under the rule of House Frey, Clegane decides to ransom Arya to her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. During their journey, Arya reveals to Clegane that she has not forgiven him for killing Mycah and has vowed to kill him. The duo arrive in the Vale to find that Lysa has ostensibly committed suicide. Returning from the Bloody Gate, they encounter Brienne of Tarth, sworn sword to Arya's mother Catelyn, who had promised to take the Stark children to safety. When Arya refuses to go with Brienne, she and Clegane engage in a brawl that culminates in her throwing Clegane off a cliff, gravely wounding him. Though he begs Arya to kill him, she instead leaves him to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://winteriscoming.net/2014/06/23/rory-mccann-hound-brienne-fighting-dirty-teaching-arya-well |title=Rory McCann on The Hound and Brienne fighting dirty, and teaching Arya all too well |website=winteriscoming.net |date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Season 6====
It is revealed Clegane had been discovered by a warrior turned septon, Ray, who nursed him back to health. Clegane assists Ray and his followers in building a sept, but returns to the community one day to find the villagers slaughtered by members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Clegane takes up arms again to hunt down those responsible, killing four of them before discovering the remaining three about to be hanged by Ser Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who inform him that the group were acting independently of the Brotherhood. Beric allows Clegane to kill two of the outlaws, and asks him to join the Brotherhood in their journey north to fight the White Walkers.

'''Peter Clemenza''' is a fictional character appearing in [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' and two of the three films based on it. He is played by [[Academy Award]]-nominee [[Richard Castellano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20076/The-Godfather/cast|title=The Godfather (1972)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-godfather-1972|publisher=rogerebert.com|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=The Godfather|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[The Godfather|film adaptation of the novel]], and by [[Bruno Kirby]] (as a young man) in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

==''The Godfather''==
Born near [[Trapani]], [[Sicily]], Peter Clemenza is one of Don [[Vito Corleone]]'s ''[[caporegimes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/the_godfather/5.html|title=Fact and Fiction in The Godfather |publisher=[[crimelibrary.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oldest friends, as well as the godfather of his eldest son, [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]. He has a reputation as a superb judge of talent; his regime produced no fewer than five future ''capos''—Sonny, [[Frank Pentangeli]], [[Rocco Lampone]], [[Al Neri]], and [[Joey Zasa]].

He is a supporting character in the story, but several of his actions are key to the plot. For example, he is ordered by Don Corleone, via ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]], to oversee the punishment of two teenage boys who received suspended sentences for beating and attempting to [[sexual assault|rape]] the daughter of undertaker [[Amerigo Bonasera]]. Vito's wife, [[Carmela Corleone|Mrs. Corleone]], is the girl's god-mother.  Clemenza assigns the job to his &quot;button man&quot; [[Paulie Gatto (The Godfather)|Paulie Gatto]], who recruits two former professional boxers turned Corleone Family loan enforcers to assist. A deleted scene from the film depicts Gatto delivering the beating.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

When the family discovers that Gatto helped [[Virgil Sollozzo]] and the Tattaglia Family set up Vito to be assassinated, Sonny orders Clemenza to execute him. Clemenza considers Gatto's actions a personal insult, having recruited and personally groomed him. According to the [[The Godfather (novel)|novel]], [[Sonny Corleone]] initially suspects Clemenza was involved in the [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], but Clemenza is eventually cleared. Clemenza chooses Rocco Lampone, then an associate, to do the hit on Gatto so Lampone can &quot;make his bones.&quot; Clemenza has Gatto drive him and Lampone around for several hours on the pretext of locating housing for Corleone soldiers in the event war breaks out with the other crime families. After Lampone shoots Gatto, Clemenza—upon returning to the car after relieving himself—utters (to Lampone) his most famous line in the film: &quot;Leave the gun. Take the [[cannoli]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=238|title=By the Breath of Their Mouths: Narratives of Resistance in Italian America|first=Mary Jo|last=Bona|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4Uxa4NzUYUC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=paulie+gatto+leave+the+gun+take&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2JKylvw0GX&amp;sig=N0eN8JKDDmmwtmXPM-nyt1m21gk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S-5LVMXQK8T2igLA74DoCg&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paulie%20gatto%20leave%20the%20gun%20take&amp;f=false|date=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press, Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is decided that Vito's youngest son, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], will murder drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, a corrupt NYPD cop on Sollozzo's payroll, Clemenza instructs Michael on using a gun, how to allay Sollozzo's suspicions, and what to do after the shooting. The plan succeeds, and while Michael hides in [[Sicily]], Clemenza prepares for an all-out war against the remaining four families. The war ultimately claims Sonny's life, and Vito resumes his leadership role. Upon returning to New York, Michael succeeds his father as the family's operating head. Clemenza and fellow ''caporegime'' [[Salvatore Tessio]], doubting Michael as Don, request permission to break off from the Corleone family and start their own families in accordance with Vito's promise made several years earlier. Michael agrees, but insists they wait a short while longer, needing to complete the family's transition to Las Vegas. When Michael is targeted for assassination by [[Emilio Barzini|Don Emilio Barzini]], who was behind Sonny's murder, Clemenza is initially suspected of being the Corleone family traitor. Tessio is the traitor, and he is killed. 

Clemenza, on Michael's orders, personally murders both [[Victor Stracci|Don Victor Stracci]] and [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo Rizzi]], Michael's brother-in-law, who conspired with Barzini to murder Sonny. In the book, Clemenza is last seen greeting Michael as &quot;Don Corleone&quot; and [[hand-kissing|kissing Michael's hand]].

==''The Sicilian''==
Clemenza appears briefly in Puzo's second ''Godfather'' installment, ''[[The Sicilian]]''. He meets with Michael during his exile in Sicily, at his brother Domenico Clemenza's home in [[Trapani]]. They discuss what the fate of [[Salvatore Giuliano|Turi Giuliano]] is to be, following the orders of a recovering [[Vito Corleone]]. Clemenza tells Michael that he should report to him after a week, with or without Giuliano, and that Michael could return to America afterward. Clemenza then leaves on a boat to [[Tunis]], telling Michael that he would be back the following day to bring him back to date with the Don's orders.

==''The Godfather Returns''==
Clemenza's gradual takeover of the Corleone empire in New York is briefly covered in ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'', [[Mark Winegardner]]'s sequel to Puzo's original novel. It also tells of Clemenza's involvement during Michael's return from exile and eventual, official initiation into the Corleone crime family. Most noteworthy, the novel depicts Clemenza's fatal heart attack (mentioned in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''), and the many [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that he had actually been murdered by the [[Carmine Rosato|Rosato Brothers]], enemies of the Corleone Family.

==''The Godfather Part II''==
{{Disputed section|date=September 2016}}
Clemenza does not appear in the present timeline of the film due to a disagreement between Castellano and [[Paramount Pictures]]; it is explained that he died some time ago and was replaced by his [[soldato|soldier]], [[Frank Pentangeli]], as head of the Corleone family's New York operations.  The Pentangeli character was created to play the role intended for Clemenza.

Clemenza, however, appears in several flashbacks focusing on Vito Corleone's early days, played by Bruno Kirby. He first meets Vito when asking him to hide some guns for him from the police. Vito does so, and Clemenza repays the favor by stealing an expensive carpet (assisted by a surprised Vito) and giving it to the Corleones for their apartment. Around the same time, Vito and Clemenza befriend a young Tessio. One of their lines of business is selling stolen dresses door-to-door; a deleted scene depicts Clemenza charming his way into the apartment of a young housewife and emerging a little later having presumably had sex with her; it is not specified in the film whether Clemenza is himself married at the time.

Later on, the trio's partnership is discovered by the local [[Black Hand (extortion)|blackhander]], [[Don Fanucci]], who attempts to [[extortion|extort]] them. Clemenza initially demands that they pay Fanucci to avoid any problems with him, but Vito talks him and Tessio into paying him less money. Shortly thereafter, Vito himself kills Fanucci and takes over the neighborhood--the beginnings of the future Corleone family.

==Video game version==
The video game title ''[[The Godfather: The Game]]'' depicts Clemenza as his movie counterpart; Castellano's estate gave permission for his likeness to be used in the game. However, due to Castellano's death in 1988, all of Clemenza's dialogue had to be recorded by Jason Schombing. 
In the game, he becomes partners and good friends with the protagonist, [[Aldo Trapani]]. He gives him several missions, such as killing members of rival families, particularly the Cuneo Family.

== Development ==

=== Characterization ===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|style=padding:8px|quote=&quot;When I first read [the script], I was mostly interested in Connor because he seemed like someone I knew—a guy from school or one of my brother’s colleagues. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Peter Nowalk]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; crafted this character that's flawed but likable. You want to hate him but he's so charming at the same time. It's so honest.&quot;|source = — Actor Jack Falahee on Connor Walsh's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timesinterview&quot;/&gt;}}

From the outset of ''Murder'', the character is portrayed as sly, sophisticated, confident, and used to getting what he wants. Walsh is openly gay, and has a &quot;rampant&quot; sex life; ''[[Buzzfeed]]'' explains, that &quot;with a libido as powerful as his mind, [Walsh] has unapologetically used his sexuality to bend men to his will and manipulated everyone blocking his path to career advancement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;buzzfeedinterview&quot;/&gt; When being tested for [[HIV]] in &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep15|It's All My Fault]]&quot;, the clinic nurse asks him how many sexual partners he had during the past year, to which he estimates between 30 and 40.&lt;ref name=&quot;It's All My Fault&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=It's All My Fault|series=How to Get Away with Murder|season=1|credits=Writer: [[Bill D'Elia|D'Elia, Bill]]. Director: Nowalk, Peter|airdate=February 26, 2015|network=American Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In ''How to Get Away with Murder'' ===

In the pilot episode, Walsh is introduced as a law student of Middleton University, a college in Philadelphia. During his first day of law school, Walsh meets Professor [[Annalise Keating]] ([[Viola Davis]]) in her criminal law class. He meets Oliver at a bar, a computer technician, who he sleeps with in order to obtain the information he needs to gain the admiration of Professor Keating. The intelligence he gains is rewarded with a trophy, and Walsh is selected by Keating to join her team –the Keating Five– despite his questionable methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pilot&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=[[How to Get Away with Murder]]|credits=Writer: [[Peter Nowalk|Nowalk, Peter]]. Director: Offer, Michael|season=1|airdate=September 25, 2014|network=[[American Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep4|Let's Get to Scooping]]&quot;, Walsh has sex with Paxton Curtis, someone he suspects is behind [[insider trading]] at the brokerage firm of Keating's client, Marren Trudeau ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]). His suspicions are correct, and after he reveals this to Keating and Trudeau, Curtis' boss humiliates and fires him. Curtis commits suicide, to which Walsh is left visibly distraught and feeling [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Get to Scooping&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Let's Get to Scooping|series=How to Get Away with Murder|credits=Writer: [[Michael Katleman|Katleman, Michael]].

[[File:JackFalahee2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Walsh has been portrayed by Falahee since the series' inception in 2014.]]

In &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep3|Smile, or Go to Jail]]&quot;, Walsh reveals that he attended boarding school with [[Michaela Pratt|Michaela Pratt's]] fiancé Aiden Walker ([[Elliot Knight]]); he discloses to Pratt that Walker may be gay, as the two previously shared a relationship while at school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smile or Go to Jail&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Smile, or Go to Jail|series=How to Get Away with Murder|credits=Writer: Fresco, Rob.

Walsh has an older sister, Gemma Walsh (Jennifer Christopher), and two nephews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best Christmas Ever&quot;/&gt;

=== Relationship ===
Walsh and computer technician [[Oliver Hampton]] ([[Conrad Ricamora]]) have had an on-and-off relationship almost from the inception of the series. In the pilot episode, the two meet at a bar, wherein Walsh seduces Hampton into giving him illegal documents to bolster a case of Keating's. At first, Hampton denies him access to the files; however, Walsh flirts with another guy, inducing Hampton into giving him the information he wants. As a way of thanking him, Walsh has sex with Hampton, much to the technician's surprise and delight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pilot&quot;/&gt;

Throughout the first few episodes of the series, the two continue to have a [[Casual sex|casual sexual relationship]] while Hampton assists Walsh in obtaining information. By the fourth episode, &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep4|Let's Get to Scooping]]&quot;, Walsh has developed feelings for Hampton; while he attempts to reveal this to Hampton, the revelation is cut short when Hampton snoops through Walsh's phone, and learns of Walsh's tryst with a person of interest in a case. Coming to the conclusion that Walsh uses sex as means of furthering his own career, Hampton kicks him out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Get to Scooping&quot;/&gt; Months later, Walsh shows up unannounced to Hampton's place, after burning Sam Keating's body, freaking out and telling him that he &quot;screwed up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Get to Scooping&quot;/&gt; Hampton is initially bewildered and unsure of what to do, but eventually comforts Walsh and invites him in. The following morning, Walsh lies to Hampton by saying that his behavior was a result of intoxication and that he has a drug problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me|series=How to Get Away with Murder|credits=Writer: Foley, Michael &amp; Swafford, Erika Green. Director: [[Stephen Williams (director)|Williams, Stephen]]|season=1|airdate=November 20, 2014|network=American Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh is eager to start fresh with Hampton in &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep10|Hello Raskolnikov]]&quot;; however, this is not reciprocated by Hampton, who still resents Walsh's conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello Raskolnikov&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hello Raskolnikov|series=How to Get Away with Murder|credits=Writer: Dalzine, Marcus. Director: Offer, Michael|season=1|airdate=January 29, 2015|network=American Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; By &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep11|Best Christmas Ever]]&quot;, Walsh surprises Hampton with a Christmas gift – a [[Knit cap|beanie]] – and asks that they resume their relationship. Hampton initially resists, but he then reveals that he is addicted to Walsh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best Christmas Ever&quot;/&gt;

In the penultimate episode of the first season, &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep14|The Night Lila Died]]&quot;, the two agree to get tested for [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Night Lila Died&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Night Lila Died|series=How to Get Away with Murder|credits=Writer: Foley, Michael. Director: Innes, Laura |season=1|airdate=February 26, 2015|network=American Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Walsh tests negative to any disease, it is revealed in the season finale, &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)#ep15|It's All My Fault]]&quot;, that Hampton tested positive to [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;It's All My Fault&quot;/&gt; In the second season premiere, &quot;[[How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)#ep1|It's Time to Move On]]&quot;, to prove that his commitment to Hampton and the relationship they share, Walsh moves into Hampton's apartment.&lt;ref name=&quot;It's Time to Move On&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=It's Time to Move On|series=How to Get Away with Murder|season=2|credits=Writer: D'Elia, Bill.

== Reception ==
The character as well as Falahee's acting have been well received by both fans and critics of the series. After the first season of ''Murder'' (2014–15), Connor Walsh was ranked by ''[[IndieWire]]'' thirteenth in a list of &quot;best [[LGBT]] characters on television&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiewirelist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/the-15-best-lgbt-characters-on-television-215385/|title=The 15 Best LGBT Characters On Television|last=/Bent|first=|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''IndieWire'' went further, stating: &quot;He's definitely not an ideal human being, but he's certainly an authentic fascinating one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indiewire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/03/the-15-best-lgbt-characters-on-television-connor-walsh-on-how-to-get-away-with-murder-215559/|title=The 15 Best LGBT Characters On Television: Connor Walsh On ‘How To Get Away With Murder’|last=Borden|first=J.D.|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=March 30, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' columnist, Richard Lawson, was partly drawn to the series because of the character Walsh, commending &quot;Falahee’s ambitious, underhanded Connor Walsh [whom is] allowed to be both good and bad, saint and sinner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VanityFair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/10/how-to-get-away-with-murder-gay-sex|title=Is How to Get Away With Murder the Most Progressive Show on Television?|last=Lawson|first=Richard|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When accepting the &quot;Outstanding Drama Series&quot; award at the [[26th GLAAD Media Awards]] on behalf of the ''Murder'' cast, actress Viola Davis emphasized the importance of Walsh and his journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;varietyglaad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2015/scene/news/kerry-washington-glee-star-alex-newell-bring-down-the-house-at-the-glaad-awards-1201457656/|title=Kerry Washington, ‘Glee’ Star Alex Newell Bring Down the House at the GLAAD Awards|last=Kelley|first=Seth|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 22, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2016|quote=&quot;“How to Get Away With Murder” star Viola Davis spoke passionately about the the [sic] importance of the show’s gay character Connor (Jack Falahee), and his relationship with Oliver (Conrad Ricamora).

'''James Cook''', known as '''Cook''' or '''Cookie''' to his friends, is a [[fictional character]] in the British teen drama ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''. He is portrayed by [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]]. In the third series his true emotions are explored and it is revealed that his womanising violent lifestyle is in fact a smoke screen to cover up his real emotions. His actions often cause trouble and create havoc, affecting those around him. However, in the fourth series he begins to change his ways after a conversation with his solicitor and when he begins to realise the consequences of his actions, most notably witnessing his younger brother beginning to follow in his footsteps. His life is then taken in a wholly other direction when he investigates the disappearance of his best friend in series four's final episodes.

==Characterisation==
Cook is an outgoing, sexually promiscuous, and in many ways self-destructive young man, who appears to have come from a troubled family background. He is an impulsive 17-year-old at the start of the series. He loves to have a good time and is constantly the life and soul of any party. Cook shows a great interest in the ladies, and all his partying can sometimes get out of hand, leading him into trouble. He loves to drink and use drugs, but whether or not he is an addict is left ambiguous to the viewers. Throughout the series, he is best friends with both Freddie and JJ, although at times, his sexual relationship with Effy Stonem drives a rift between them. Despite his self-destructive lifestyle, Cook is unusually caring and kind-hearted - as seen in his fondness for JJ, and his kindness to Naomi and Pandora when they are in tough times.

==Character history==
Cook was born in 1992.

===Series 3===
In &quot;Everyone&quot;, Cook, Freddie and JJ meet Effy the morning before they start college, all instantly falling for her. During roll-call the first day, Cook flirts with Naomi, who ignores his attempts. Effy sets Cook and Freddie a challenge: whoever breaks the college rules gets to “know her better”. Cook breaks the rules, to the point of starting a fire. His reward is sex with Effy in the nurse’s office.

In &quot;Cook&quot;, Cook invites the gang to his uncle’s pub to celebrate his seventeenth birthday which he believes will be a wild, drink-fueled event, but it backfires. The girls decide to leave after Pandora throws up. Cook persuades them otherwise, promising drugs. Freddie gets a call from his sister, Karen, who is at her friend Kayleigh’s engagement party. Cook rounds the gang up and they head over there uninvited. Cook flirts with Kayleigh, and starts passing out drugs to his friends. He ends up angering Johnny White, Kayleigh’s father and a Bristol drug lord. Cook gets beaten up and the rest of the gang leave with him. Cook then drags JJ to a brothel after an argument with Freddie. There they find Johnny White. Cook taunts and injures him. Johnny vows to kill Cook next time he sees him.

In &quot;Pandora&quot;, Cook crashes Pandora's party and has sex with Effy in a closet. While they were having sex they fell back into Pandora's next-door neighbour's room., where they came across a video of Pandora's mum having sex with the next-door neighbour. Then, Pandora comes out of the bathroom upset, by which point Cook is the only other person in the house. When Pandora expresses unhappiness that she never got to do the activities she wanted that night - play Twister and learn about human sexuality from her friends - Cook offers to play the game with her out of pity. He then offers to have sex with her, and they spend a while together as the sun rises above Bristol. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. After an argument, Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behaviour, belongs to no one.

In &quot;Freddie&quot;, Freddie gets tired of living in the shadow of the increasingly reckless Cook. Although Freddie reveals his true feelings for Effy, which she reciprocates, she goes back to Cook because she's afraid to love anyone.

In &quot;Naomi&quot;, Cook tries again to convince Naomi to have sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he has a better chance of winning the election for student body president. He sees this as a challenge, and registers as a candidate. She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, especially when his campaign turns out to be more about making a spectacle than any actual plans. Yet, their classmates seem to prefer Cook. Naomi is doubly humiliated in front of the form when Cook ridicules her and Emily subsequently stands up for her, and Cook jokes about Emily being her &quot;girlfriend.&quot; Naomi later witnesses her teachers rigging the votes to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form after she is announced the winner of the elections. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Cook and begins to have sex with him before she realises that it &quot;isn't right&quot;. Cook doesn't make any attempts to force her, as he says she's &quot;clever&quot; enough to have a reason not to follow through. She leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other.

In &quot;JJ&quot;, JJ sees his mother, Celia, overwhelmed by all of his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook to tell him how he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. However, when JJ, encouraged by Emily, goes to confront Effy, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that the girl he was having sex with was with Pandora. Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie, and explodes in a violent rage when he realises Cook is indifferent to his feelings. Moved by this, Cook give JJ a hug and tells him that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs, knowing they are designed both to make people relax and become more honest. They then meet their friends at a club. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone ([[Merveille Lukeba]]) lets them into the club, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dance floor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs. Cook, under the influence of JJ's drugs, is compelled to tell the truth and confesses that Effy loves Freddie. Cook says that he loves Effy, but knows his feelings are not reciprocated and that is why he is sleeping with Pandora.

In &quot;Effy&quot;, Cook crashes the gang's camping trip, and in anger reveals many of the group's secrets, including the fact that he and Pandora are still sleeping together - which causes Thomas to break up with her. After Effy is ousted from the group, he decides to take her on a road trip, to get away from it all.

In &quot;Finale&quot;, Cook and Effy are in self-imposed exile from the gang; they've gone to stay with Cook's father. They are found by JJ and Freddie, who try to bring them back, but soon realise that Cook is beginning to fall in love with Effy. Cook, Freddie and JJ take part in the town's annual steeple chase, the reward for them at the end being Effy, although Cook's father's boat is also part of a wager with another man entering the chase. Neither Cook nor Freddie win, the winner in fact being JJ, resulting in the loss of the boat and Effy. However, JJ chooses to pressure Effy to make a choice between the three boys; her gaze lingers on Freddie, causing Cook to leave in a fit of rage. Towards the end of the episode, Cook goes to his father's boat hoping to leave with him; his father tells him he never wanted him the first place, but Cook, sobbing, still angrily refuses to hand over the keys. His father, exasperated, pulls out a flare and threatens to burn Cook's face off, not caring whether Cook lives or dies, to which Cook replies, &quot;I don't, either.&quot; Freddie arrives and knocks Cook's father unconscious before he can do any harm to Cook. Freddie asks Cook to say it's okay for him to be with Effy; Cook says he can't do it because he loves her, and he's sorry. JJ and Effy arrive, followed by the townspeople hoping to claim Cook's dad's boat. But Cook, JJ, Freddie and Effy quickly set sail. Cook's dad awakes to them setting sail, and upon realises that his boat is safe shouts &quot;I'm Cook!&quot; in an antagonistic manner at Cook and his friends. Cook then shouts back at his father, &quot;No, I'm Cook!&quot; and pushes him off the boat. As they sail away toward Bristol, the episode ends with Freddie asking, &quot;So, what do we do now?&quot;

===Series 4===
In &quot;Thomas&quot;, The gang, excluding Effy, witness the suicide of a teenage girl, Sophia, after she had taken drugs. The police launch an investigation into the death. Thomas feels guilty about Sophia’s death and suspects Cook sold her the drugs before her death. Thomas turns to religion and becomes attracted to the daughter of his church’s pastor, Andrea, and eventually sleeps with her. At school Thomas is expelled and admits to cheating on Pandora, who storms off. Depressed, Thomas gets drunk and attacks Cook, this leads to Naomi admitting that Cook gave Naomi the drugs, which Naomi later gave to Sophia.

In &quot;Emily&quot;, Emily learns that Naomi was dealing powder with Cook the night of the suicide and sold some to Sophia to pay for the motorbike goggles she bought her. Cook sees Effy and Freddie kissing at the party and takes his anger out on a fellow party-goer, severely beating him and ends up accidentally headbutting JJ also.

In &quot;Cook&quot;, Cook is in prison, charged with Grievous Bodily Harm for beating up Shanky Jenkins at the house party. Duncan, Cook’s legal aid, advises him to plead guilty, but Cook pleads not guilty instead. He is released from prison with an electronic tag and sent to live with his mother, Ruth, a famous artist. At home, Cook bonds with his younger brother Paddy who adores him, but clashes with his vain and perpetually drunken mother. Cook is expelled from college. He visits Naomi who informs him they must deal with their guilt over Sophia. Afterwards Duncan tells Cook there is no case and that he should grow up. Cook visits his mother’s art exhibit and is shocked to learn that she had a brief sexual relationship with Freddie. Freddie admits Ruth gave him a blow job at Cook’s 15th birthday party and pleads for Cook to stop acting out. Cook argues with his mother, leaves the house with Paddy and steals Ruth’s car, trashing it. Cook has a moment of insight when he sees his brother acting like him. He finds Naomi and has a heart-to-heart, bonding over how they both love someone. He then goes back to his legal aid Duncan and has a breakdown. Afterwards he tells the police he sold Sophia the MDMA, taking the flak for Naomi. Effy visits Cook in prison and tells him she loves Freddie. Cook pleads guilty at trial and is imprisoned.

In &quot;Freddie&quot;, After Freddie clears the party out, Cook remains, having apparently escaped from jail prior to the beginning of the episode, saying he couldn't stick being stuck with &quot;a million me's anymore&quot;. However, when seeing him, Effy begins to freak out, yelling at him to leave. Later, Freddie tries to follow a freaked out Effy who ran away from him, but loses sight of her in the large crowd, however he runs into Cook and asks him for help.
 
In &quot;Effy&quot;, She runs into Cook and after an argument, Cook tells her that he would redo the last two years all over again, and that he still loves her. Effy tells him to piss off and leaves. The next morning, she is at a park, and Cook sits on the bench next to her. As they are talking, Cook mentions that Freddie calls him about her (and calls her &quot;Ef&quot;). Effy looks confused, asking who &quot;Ef&quot; is. Cook thinks she's joking, and says that he's mistaken and that she isn't Ef. Effy smiles and tells him that he's right. Looking confused, Cook asks her what her name is, to which she replies &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. Cook then reintroduces himself as James. He takes her to a party, and they talk. Effy mentions that she normally doesn't go on a date with someone she just met. Cook goes along with it, not telling her that they have already met. She then tells him that she wants to do something bad, and Cook replies that she's come to the right person. As they walk down the street, they end up at the street where Tony got hit by a bus. Effy's memory begins to get jogged, and begins remembering. Cook, not understanding that Effy really didn't remember him, tells her that she wins (thinking it was a game). Effy is confused, but Cook tells her that they have met, dated, and had sex. Effy tries to deny it, but Cook brings up things only someone close to her would know. Effy finally remembers her brother being hit, but she begins to freak out. She doesn't know what's wrong with her, not knowing if things did or didn't happen. Cook slaps her to &quot;wake&quot; her up, and Effy wants him to do it again. After pushing Cook, she runs off, with him chasing her. She runs into the freeway and gets almost hit by a car. Cook saves her and she kisses him. Effy remembers everything and tells Cook to get her to Freddie. Cook brings Effy to Freddie and they talk about the relationship between all three of them, they argue when Cook realises Freddie was planning on leaving. He leaves telling Freddie not to screw it up.

In &quot;Everyone&quot;, Karen and Cook start to become concerned about Freddie's whereabouts. Karen gives Cook Freddie's notebook saying &quot;John Foster wants to hurt her&quot; implying Effy. The police then raid Naomi's house after Cook's ex-girlfriend Arsia tells the police where he is hiding. Cook escapes and goes to Freddie's shed where he meets Effy who has been released from the psychiatric hospital. The rest of the gang meet there and decide to throw a party for Freddie's birthday even though he isn't there. Cook heads outside briefly where he spots a figure observing Freddie's house. He decides to follow. Meanwhile, Thomas and Pandora make up along with Emily and Naomi. Cook breaks into John's basement where he finds Freddie's blood stained clothes and shoes. Cook then seemingly hears Freddie's ghostly voice warning him to &quot;get out&quot; before Foster returns, this spooks Cook into turning on a light just as Foster arrives with his baseball bat. John hits him in the stomach almost knocking him to the ground and verbally taunts him. Cook gets up laughing, and admits he is a criminal and has no sense or impulse control, he then tells John that he knows he killed Freddie. As the season ends, he launches himself at Foster, screaming &quot;I'm Cook!&quot;

===Series 7===
In &quot;Rise&quot;, Cook has been a fugitive for three years, and is now working as a drug dealer in Manchester. When he is asked to help his employer's girlfriend find a house and finds that he is irresistibly attracted to her, he sets off a chain of events which will lead him into a world of savage revenge and a confrontation with his own teenage past. It was revealed in &quot;Rise: Part 1&quot; that Cook killed John Foster at the end of series 4 and has been on the run ever since. In &quot;Rise: Part 2&quot;, Cook deals with his issues and makes a decision not to kill his employer, who at this point had killed his girlfriend, Emma, and threatened to kill Cook as well, but decides to be the bigger man and walk away.

'''Michael Corinthos''' is a [[fictional character]] on ''[[General Hospital]]'', an [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. Born onscreen in 1997, the role was portrayed by several child actors, most notably [[Dylan Cash]] when the character was [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|rapidly aged]] in 2002. In 2009, the character was aged again when [[Drew Garrett]] stepped into the role. Garrett was replaced by [[Chad Duell]] after one year with the series.

As the son of [[A. J. Quartermaine]] and [[Carly Corinthos]], nephew of mob enforcer [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]], and adoptive son of mob boss [[Sonny Corinthos]], he is born into chaos. Taken from A. J. as a child, Michael is raised at the center of a bitter battle between his biological family, the wealthy [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaines]], and the [[Corinthos family]]. The character's most significant storylines include his accidental shooting of [[Kate Howard]], his own shooting and waking from a coma in 2009, the murder of his stepmother [[Claudia Zacchara]] and being sent to prison where he was raped, and his grandmother [[Monica Quartermaine]] being upset over the loss of her grandson (until A. J. tells Monica what happened to Michael).

In 2012, Michael is reunited with his biological father which puts him back in the middle of the re-ignited battle between his parents. The character has had significant relationships with former exotic dancer [[Abby Haver]] and ''One Life to Live''{{'}}s [[Starr Manning]]. Most recently, the character has embraced his biological roots, and was involved in a romantic triangle with his brother, [[Morgan Corinthos|Morgan]] and love interest [[Kiki Jerome]]. Michael spent the majority of his life trying to emulate his adoptive father, but has since matured into his own man. However, he has a habit of sacrificing himself for the good of others. Most recently, he has strayed away from that path.

==Casting and portrayals==
Born on-screen on December 29, 1997, the role was originated by child actors Blake and Dylan Hopkins. The twin actors were replaced by Tiarnan Cunningham in 2001, who stayed with the series until 2002. On March 28, 2002, [[Dylan Cash]] made his first appearance as Michael, aging the character and revising his birth year to 1995. After three years with the series, Cash signed a contract in April 2005. In March 2008, rumors began circulating that Cash's contract was about to expire and would not be renewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cash OUT Rumor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2008/03/22/shocking-rumor-dylan-cash-out|title=SHOCKING RUMOR: Dylan Cash OUT???|date=March 22, 2008|first=Jamey|last=Giddens|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by April several sources confirmed the fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Cash OUT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/gh/news/2008/0414-cash.php|title=Dylan Cash ousted, Michael headed for recast|date=April 11, 2008|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soapcentral.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BuddyTV]]'' reported that Cash was blindsided by his firing, and confirmed the series was considering aging the character.

At this time, Garrett was still unaware of the role he was auditioning for, knowing it only to be &quot;Michael,&quot; and a week later his agent told him his follow up screen test was cancelled and that he was the new Michael Corinthos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett Fairman&quot;/&gt; On March 22, 2010, several reports surfaced confirming that Drew Garrett had been let go from the series, and the role of Michael was to be recast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/generalhospital/news/id/7507/General_Hospital_Recasting_the_Role_of_Michael_Cor/|title=General Hospital Recasting the Role of Michael Corinthos|date=March 22, 2010|publisher=Atomic Online|work=Soaps She Knows|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0322-garrett.php|title=Drew Garrett out, GH recasts Michael|publisher=Soapcentral.com|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Garrett made his finale appearance in the role of Michael on April 19, 2010.

Michael is not in any way thinking about his future. He is just worried about how he can get the most excitement out of the life he currently has. Michael refuses to take no for an answer which often gets him into trouble. According to Garrett, Michael does not believe he has any other options in life which is why he is determined to work for his father. Michael stubbornly refuses to accept that working for Sonny is not an option.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOD032210&quot;/&gt; Things are further complicated when Michael cannot control emotions. What makes matters worse is that Michael does not know why he gets so angry; the not knowing perpetuates the anger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett Fairman&quot;/&gt;

He has brain trauma, and if people saw what I, as Michael, almost did to Warren Bauer on last week’s episode, which was almost kill him, you know that. He snaps, but it builds up. Michael bottles it up. He tries not to show people his anger. If he were to show people his anger, maybe what happened to him in prison would be more revealed to everyone. I am trying to show the heart, soul, and sensitivity of Michael and the struggle that he is going through, more so than him being kind of an ‘in your face attacking’ kind of a person.&quot;

Duell described his character as being very multi-layered, having a lot of baggage, but also a great heart. He says that Michael loves his family, and wants to make his father proud, which in Duell's eyes, is what makes the character so interesting; &quot;He's very complex.

|salign = right
|source =Bob Guza on the aftermath of Michael's shooting.}}It was Guza's belief that the most appropriate way to address fan disapproval of the lack of consequences for Michael's recent actions was to have Michael take a bullet himself. According to Guza, the incident also forces—Sonny, Carly, Jason, and Jax—the adults in Michael's life to reevaluate their choices. Guza's dialogue for the Johnny Zacchara character expresses that all four are to blame, stating, &quot;kill each other for power and money and turn around and lie and say that we have honor, that we protect family, that women and children are safe.&quot; However, Michael's shooting would not completely do away with the violence in the show. It instead serves as a catalyst forcing those around Michael to make life-altering decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guza EW Shooting&quot;/&gt;

Because Michael and his adoptive half-sister [[Kristina Davis]] ([[Lexi Ainsworth]]) have very little contact growing up, the writers considered developing a romance between the two. Garrett believed that if either of them were to develop feelings, it would be Kristina, as Michael is too preoccupied with his recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett Fairman&quot;/&gt; Michael is immediately angry with Carly for not being present when he opens his eyes, and believes she is trying to replace him by having another child. The storyline also allows for further development of Michael's relationship with Jason, who also suffered from a brain injury when he was a little older than Michael. Jason becomes Michael's confidant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrett Fairman&quot;/&gt; The story also featured a guest appearance on the June 29, 2009 episode from then [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] Outfielder, [[Connor Jackson]], as Michael's physical therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/2009/06/baller-conor-jackson-on-general-hospital|title=Baller Conor Jackson on ‘General Hospital’|date=June 2, 2009|first=Errol|last=Lewis|work=[[Soap Opera Network]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4271439|title=Backup plan: Conor Jackson|date=June 25, 2009|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|work=[[ESPN The Magazine]]|first=Conor|last=Jackson|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael is believed to be responsible for the accident; to avoid facing what he believes he has done, Michael and Kristina run away to [[Mexico]]. Claudia then enlists sociopath, [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roché]]) and orders him to track them down and kill them; instead Jerry uses the teens to lure Jason into a trap. Fortunately, Michael realizes that Jerry is holding them prisoner; Michael is very much like Sonny when it comes to recognizing a threat. Kristina doesn't want to believe Jerry is going to hurt them, but because the siblings were brought up differently, they see the situation differently. Michael and Kristina's attempt to live independently and start new lives in Mexico is cut short and they are forced back to Port Charles. However, the adventure leads to Michael's first kiss with a local girl, Marita.&lt;ref name=&quot;On the Run&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=late-breaking news: GH TEENS ON THE RUN|page=12|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Brown had started speaking out against the direction of her storyline, and her disapproving of Claudia intentionally trying to hurt Michael or Kristina. The complaints were followed by the announcement of Brown's departure in September 2009 with her onscreen exit slated for October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/soaps/news/958-sarah-brown-announces-departure-from-gh|title=Sarah Brown Announces Departure From 'GH'|date=September 16, 2009|publisher=SoSoure Media|work=TVSource|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fans assumed that once the truth about Claudia's involvement in Michael's shooting was revealed, she would end up dead. An article from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' called for just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/09/18/sarah-browns-out-will-claudia-be-killed-off-general-hospital/|title=Sarah Brown's out: will Claudia be killed off General Hospital?|date=September 18, 2009|first=Allison|last=Waldman|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Brown's exit coinciding with November [[Sweeps]], it was expected that Brown's exit would have a major impact on the storyline.

But, because Michael is not exactly sure if his memories are accurate, he hesitates to come forward. Michael goes so far as to warn Johnny that Jason and Sonny will soon learn the truth, telling Johnny that he may be the only person who can save Claudia. On October 30, 2009, Regan Cellura of ''Daytime Confidential'' posted a spoiler article confirming that Claudia was indeed going to die. On the night of Claudia's birthday party, Jason comes to Sonny with confirmation that Claudia hired the shooter that tried to kill him. Most fans had previously assumed that Sonny would be the one to &quot;eliminate&quot; Claudia, but in a shocking twist, it is Michael who finally kills Claudia. After Sonny outs Claudia at the party, she takes a laboring Carly hostage at gunpoint. The women end up at an abandoned cabin in the woods where a crazed Claudia, still grieving over her own miscarriage, plans to take Carly's newborn daughter [[Josslyn Jacks|Josslyn]] for herself. On the November 4, 2009 episode, as Claudia is about to run away with baby Josslyn, Michael comes upon Claudia's car and goes searching. He finds the cabin, and hearing his mother's screams, Michael grabs the first thing he sees — an axe handle — and swings it, bludgeoning Claudia to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2009/10/30/general-hospital-spoilers|title=General Hospital Spoilers!|first=Regan|last=Cellura|date=October 30, 2009|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cover-up and prison (2009–10)===
After the murder, Michael makes a &quot;startling&quot; change in behavior by not showing any emotional reaction, believing Claudia deserved what she got, and justifying his actions to save his mother and sister. However, Michael only feels guilty because he did not come forward about his flashbacks sooner and knows he could have prevented the situation. When it comes to Claudia, &quot;Michael is in a very dark place,&quot; said Garrett to ''Soap Opera Digest''. The reckless behavior is Michael's attempt to live up to the [[Corinthos family|Corinthos]] reputation, even going so far as to sic Sonny's goons on Kristina's jerk boyfriend, [[Kiefer Bauer]] ([[Christian Alexander]]). Despite Sonny's disapproval, Michael is more than determined to join Sonny's organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HOT Plots Preview!|page=16|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael feels invincible believing he got away with what he did because of who his father is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GENERAL HOSPITAL|page=99|date=December 15, 2009|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Michael's decisions are a source of conflict for his parents. Michael constantly insinuates himself into Sonny's business, despite Carly and Jason's disapproval. Sonny disapproves too, but believes keeping Michael close will protect him. Weeks prior to his 18th birthday, Michael warns his parental figures that he will start making decisions for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GENERAL HOSPITAL: A BREWING STORM|page=99|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the moment Michael realizes that Sonny might be convicted, Michael returns home with the evidence (his bloody shirt) in hand. However, Dante does not believe Michael's claims of guilt until after a forensics exam confirms them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HIT PARADE|first1=Lauren|last1=Flynn|first2=Mara|last2=Levinsky|first3=Tom|last3=Stacy|pages=38–40|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Duell, Michael is in turmoil because no one wants him to confess. Dante tells Michael that if he comes forward, the judge will give him a lighter sentence. Duell stated: &quot;[Dante] thinks I need to get it off my chest. Of course he wants Sonny in prison, but he doesn't want me to hold this burden on myself. He wants me to get it out of my system.&quot; Dante relays Michael's story to the entire courtroom moments before the verdict for Sonny is delivered.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429033522/http://abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/Duell-interview-1|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/Duell-interview-1|title=Chad Duell Interview|page=1|date=April 2010|archivedate=April 29, 2010|publisher=[[ABC Daytime]]|work=[[General Hospital]]|accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about Michael's future following the murder confession, Duell said, &quot;A different life. He's going to go through a big change. He's going to have a much different lifestyle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC 3&quot;/&gt;

Michael is sentenced to 10 years in prison and forced to go in alone. Some of the prisoners give him trouble because he is Sonny's son, but one man named Carter ([[Josh Wingate]]) protects him. However, on May 21, Carter warns Michael and decides that he must repay him for protecting him. Michael fights him off, but Carter returns that night and tells Michael to &quot;pay up&quot; as he corners him. In the next episode, Jason discovers a nearly catatonic Michael and realizes something is wrong. Jason tries to help him cope without actually acknowledging what he believes happened. Michael is in denial when Jason finally questions him about the incident and he blames himself for &quot;everything,&quot; by rehashing Claudia's murder. Hints are dropped, but Michael never confirms anything. Joe Diliberto of ''Soap Opera Digest'' acknowledged that the storyline, which started out pretty straightforward, started to become very vague. Duell admitted that &quot;As the actor playing him, I play it a certain way; how I feel [events] played out, so it's still a mystery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dual Duell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/chad-duell-portrays-dual-meanings-0|title=Chad Duell Portrays Dual Meanings|first=Joe|last=Diliberto|date=July 2, 2010|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before any confirmation, Guza said the &quot;focus right now is on the horrific experience of an 18- or 19-year-old who is thrown into a terrible situation like this.&quot; He didn't want to make the story so specific so soon, but said the story could go in that direction. Michael has to deal at some point, but because of who Michael is, and who his father is, it is expected that he would get unwanted attention and attacks. Guza also revealed that Michael would get out of prison relatively quickly, but whatever happened to him would &quot;fester.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rape?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/General-Hospital-Rape-1019183.aspx|title=What Exactly Happened to General Hospital's Michael?|date=June 3, 2010|first=Michael|last=Logan|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that Jason's rival, the crazed artist [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]] ([[James Franco]]) sent Carter after Michael in prison.

|quote = &quot;The writers let me have the leeway as an actor to show what I feel happened to Michael, so I am playing it a certain way. I have an idea of what happened, but it's best for the show right now to keep people guessing; keep that element of mystery.

|source =Duell on his portrayal of Michael during the storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dual Duell&quot;/&gt;}} In an interview with ''On-Air On-Soaps'', Duell said the writers allowed him to play with the scenes (Michael in the cell after the confrontation with Carter) as he felt they played out, and would make a decision based on his portrayal. However, precaution is taken and Michael gets tested for [[HIV]] in addition to getting treated for his bruises. It is obvious Michael has been involved in a physical altercation of some sort, but the writers continue dancing around the subject. Chad Duell explained that it was difficult not to reveal too much during interviews and said that Michael would do the same; &quot;He would not want to reveal too much.&quot; Duell explained that if Michael was raped, it would be hard for him to just come out and say it. It would be equally hard for everyone in his life to find out about the situation, and it would be really difficult for Michael to come to terms with it. Duell believed that if Michael had been raped, he would be a lot more distant and shut himself off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duell Fairman&quot;/&gt; Despite there being no actual confirmation at the time of the storyline, fans and critics made the assumption that Michael had been sexually assaulted. ''XFINITY's'' Sara Bibel highlighted the soap's pattern of putting their teenage characters in peril. According to Bibel, &quot;What was a vague allusion of something that could happen… became an overt possibility&quot; within a week of Michael's stint in prison. In response to Michael's reactions when being touched, Bibel concluded, &quot;In real life, getting punched in the face by a convict who claims to be offering protection would be traumatic enough to elicit [that] reaction from an 18-year-old who is new to prison life. But this is a soap. Anyone who flinches when being touched, has in all probability been sexually assaulted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GH goes Oz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2010/05/26/deep-soap-is-general-hospital-really-going-to-oz/|title=Deep Soap: Is ‘General Hospital’ Really Going to ‘Oz’?|date=May 26, 2010|first=Sara|last=Bibel|work=XFINITY TV|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Michael finally does get released from prison, he is on probation, and he cannot really enjoy his freedom because Jason, who got himself arrested to protect Michael, is still in jail. However, what makes matters worse for Michael is that he cannot have contact with Sonny; Michael is left without either father figure that raised him, so he feels alone and isolated. To top it all off, Michael has to live with Dante.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prison release&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=late-breaking: GH'S MICHAEL IS RELEASED|page=6|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romance with Abby and the rape (2010–11)===
In July 2010, Chad Duell confirmed that show was developing a love interest for Michael and actresses would soon begin auditioning for the role. Duell explained that there would always be drama in any relationship Michael had with a girl because of what happened to him; &quot;it will be difficult for him to be physical with a girl, or even be affectionate with a woman,&quot; Duell stated. Like any other aspect of Michael's life, intimacy of any kind becomes a struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duell Fairman&quot;/&gt; Michael is forced to confront his intimacy issues when Kristina's friend Ali (Maitland McConnell) takes an interest in him. When Ali invites him to a party, he goes to his aunt, [[Sam McCall]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]) and confides in her that he insecure about possibly getting intimate with Ali because he does not have any sexual experience. Sam enlists her stripper friend, Candy ([[Andrea Bogart]]) to help Michael deal with his intimacy issues. When the two are about to have sex for the first time in October 2010, Michael gets cold feet and gets a little aggressive with Candy when he believes things are moving too fast. Candy backs off and advises Michael that getting to know Ali would be his best option. In the meantime, Michael takes a liking to Candy and wants to get to know her. He learns that her real name is actually Abigail &quot;Abby&quot; Haver and that she only got into stripping so she could pay for her schooling. According to Duell, Michael finds it easy to talk to Abby because she doesn't know him; they can start with a clean slate. During an interview with ''[[Soap Opera Weekly]]'', Duell revealed &quot;She doesn't know about his baggage; what's happened to him in the past. She knows nothing about his family.&quot; Michael and Abby are able to start off fresh and build their relationship based on them getting to know one another. Michael does not have anyone his age who gives him that sense of &quot;anonymity,&quot; because all of his classmates are aware of his past struggles. A friendship with someone as mature as Abby is just the kind of relationship Michael needs to help him deal with his own issues. Despite Michael really enjoying Abby's company, it would take a while before she gets him to open up and talk about what happened to him in prison. Duell admitted that Michael might never want to acknowledge what happened to him prison, unless he reaches his &quot;breaking point.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;In Confidence&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/ghs-michael-speaking-confidence-0|title=GH's Michael: Speaking in Confidence|first=Joe|last=Diliberto|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote box

It's almost a fantasy to think it wouldn't! Uproar from the audience was to be expected, but the only honest way for us to tell the story is to really deal with the reality of prison life.

|source =[Bob] Guza on Michael's rape&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Rape&quot;/&gt;
}}Michael finally reaches that point in January 2011 when he comes clean about his experience in prison. Viewers had suspected for months that Michael was raped and on January 31, 2011, Michael confirms those suspicions. Michael must relive the horrific experience of his rape at the hands of Carter when he witnesses Abby's ex-boyfriend, [[List of General Hospital characters#L|Brandon Lowell]] ([[Ross Thomas (actor)|Ross Thomas]])'s attempted rape on her. Though the scenes are not very revealing, then head-writer, Bob Guza, wanted to make sure viewers noticed the visual and physical similarities between the attempted rape on Abby, and Michael's actual rape in prison. Michael's saving of Abby before she is actually raped serves as a kind of &quot;catharsis&quot; for him, allowing him to finally admit his experience in prison. &quot;We needed a catalyst,&quot; Guza said during an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' and Abby filled that role.

Each reaction to Michael's confession is very different; With Sonny, &quot;Michael somehow feels like he's let his father down,&quot; but in his own way, Sonny also has the &quot;right&quot; reaction to Michael's confession. Carly's reaction is also very out of character, instead of allowing her anger to get the best of her, she embraces Michael. She even convinces him to go to counseling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Rape&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/General-Hospitals-Michael-1028422.aspx|title=General Hospital's Michael Reveals He Was Raped|first=Michael|last=Logan|authorlink=Michael Logan (journalist)|date=January 27, 2011|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when it comes to the confession, it appears that Jason is the most affected by it. &quot;Jason has always been Michael's mentor,&quot; Guza explained, but is Jason's lifestyle that is directly responsible for Michael landing in prison, and by extension, the rape. The &quot;guilt-stricken&quot; Jason makes sure to remind Michael that &quot;he's a survivor, not a victim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Rape&quot;/&gt; Once Michael has faced his past, he is able to open up to Abby and they make love for the first time on March 28, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstTime&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/generalhospital/update/id/12213/Stone_Cold_Sober/|title=Stone Cold Sober|work=Soaps She Knows|publisher=Atomic Online|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with his new sense of freedom, and his new love, Michael is still determined to break into the mob. Upon his release, Michael &quot;swore to himself he would never let anyone make him feel small and helpless as Carter (Josh Wingate) did to him and there's a part of him that wants to have the power now after feeling completely powerless,&quot; Duell revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSK Duell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/generalhospital/news/id/18769/Soapscom_Interviews_General_Hospitals_Chad_Duell/|title=Soaps.com Interviews General Hospital's Chad Duell.|date=July 25, 2011|publisher=Atomic Online|work=Soaps She Knows|first=Lori|last=Wilson|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael feels as if something was stolen from him in prison, so he wants to use the mob to fill that void. Despite understanding Michael's reasons for wanting to be in the mob, Duell described the obsession as &quot;silly,&quot; because Michael is willing to throw his life away, despite all the support and opportunities he has.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSK Duell&quot;/&gt; Fortunately, Abby is able to distract him from those desires and convinces him to work at ELQ with her instead.

However, Michael and Abby's age difference becomes a big problem for his mother, and his little sister, Kristina. Duell said that Michael and Abby &quot;common ground with each other. Michael went through something really awful and she has been through abusive stuff.&quot; In addition, Michael and Abby do indeed love one another. Michael Fairman worried that because of Duell's performances whenever Michael is faced with tough situations, Michael would eventually lose Abby. Duell responded saying he'd have no problem playing a scenario in which Michael loses Abby, if it made sense, and was well written; however, he was content with and enjoyed building Michael's relationship with Abby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duell-Bogart&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/ghs-chad-duell-andrea-bogart-interview-michael-abbys-romance-elq-and-working-together/2011/08/13/|title= GH’s Chad Duell &amp; Andrea Bogart Interview: Michael &amp; Abby’s romance, ELQ, and working together!|date=August 13, 2011|first=Michael|last=Fairman|work=On-Air On-Soaps|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairman's words may have been prophetic because Andrea Bogart officially departed from the series several months later on December 13, 2011 when Abby is killed in a construction accident, leaving Michael devastated. Bogart stated that she hoped that Michael would eventually find some happiness because he had been through so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/andrea-bogart-talks-about-her-exit-from-general-hospital/2011/12/17/|title= Andrea Bogart talks about her exit from General Hospital!|first=Michael|last=Fairman|work=On-Air On-Soaps|date=December 17, 2011|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romance with Starr and A.J.'s return (2012–13)===
Upon Alderson's introduction as Starr, viewers and critics immediately began speculating that the two would be paired together. Duell said that he really enjoyed working with Alderson and said that he was ready for Michael to find some happiness. Michael and Starr's relationship starts off complicated because Sonny is believed to behind the deaths of her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|chapter=HOT Plots Preview|title=GENERAL HOSPITAL: Michael Rescues Starr|page=12|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they immediately relate to one another because they are both grieving the loss of people they love. According to when Starr and Michael first start to bond, it is like one big &quot;therapy session.&quot; Michael has to get Starr to trust him which is complicated by the fact that he could not save her family, and his father is the prime suspect in her family's murders. Michael defending Sonny causes a lot of trouble for the duo. Duell revealed that even if Michael and Starr were to become romantic, it would take quite some time as both of them needed to heal first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Starr's New Savior|chapter=News|page=6|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Starr begins lashing out at Sonny, Michael understands that she has to blame someone. Talking with Starr starts the healing process for Michael. The two become friends rather quickly despite their father's being at odds. However, Duell revealed that a romance was possible once they could get past what has happened. But Duell hoped that it would not be rushed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|chapter=News|title=Starr-Crossed Lovers?|page=6|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|date=April 16, 2012|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Duell, helping Starr, could eventually help Michael come to terms with his own loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=looking for a new love|page=57|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|publisher=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|date=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And by the summer of 2012, Michael and Starr have admitted their feelings for one another and began dating. However, their new friendship and budding romance is threatened with re-introduction of Michael's sister, Kristina (Lindsey Morgan) and the arrival of her reality show producer, [[Trey Mitchell]] (Erik Valdez). Trey seems to annoy Starr a lot, which causes Michael to become a bit more protective of her. However, when Starr and Trey begin to commiserate over their fathers, Starr feels as if Michael is overreacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|chapter=News|title=Will Trey Fall For Starr?|pages=5|date=November 26, 2012|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing ever comes of Trey's advances, as Michael and Starr grow closer as she supports him through the return of his biological father, and the death of his uncle.

The re-introduction of Michael's biological father, A.J. ([[Sean Kanan]]) completely turns his life upside down. Michael grows up believing the bitter battle was started by A.J. However, when A.J. tells him otherwise, Michael initially refuses to believe A.J.'s claims of being drugged in an alley by Carly, or left hanging on a meat hook by Sonny until he confronts his mother and she confirms A.J.'s stories. Michael is completely blindsided and disgusted by his mother's past actions. He never expected any of what A.J. told him to be true. Though he does not condone A.J.'s own actions – like kidnapping Michael and faking his death – Michael reminds Carly that A.J. only tried to defend himself in the war she started. Michael has mixed emotions; he does not know what to feel. Michael has so many questions running through his head, and majority of them begin with &quot;What if?&quot; Michael is completely torn on what to do. Is A.J. capable of change or telling the truth; would giving A.J. a chance hurt his relationships with Carly and Sonny.&lt;ref name=&quot;gold star&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|chapter=gold star|work=[[Soaps In Depth]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|pages=94–95|volume=16|issue=50|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==

===1997–2008===
When Carly ([[Sarah Brown (actress)|Sarah Brown]]) becomes pregnant, she names Jason ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]) as the father, believing {{Nowrap|A.J.}} ([[Billy Warlock]]) to be unfit. Upon birth, Michael is taken in by Jason and his girlfriend [[Robin Scorpio]] ([[Kimberly McCullough]]) as Carly is suffering from [[postpartum depression]]. Jason must make the decision to get Michael surgery when the child is diagnosed with a severe heart condition. In February 1998, Michael is christened with [[Emily Quartermaine]] ([[Amber Tamblyn]]) and [[Mike Corbin]] ([[Ron Hale]]) as his godparents. Carly's ex-fiancé, [[Tony Jones (General Hospital)|Tony Jones]] ([[Brad Maule]]), upset that he is not Michael's father, kidnaps the boy. Robin tells A.J. that Michael is his son, and Carly attempts a marriage with A.J. Afterwards she marries Sonny, who threatens A.J. until he gives up his paternal rights. Upon [[Sonny Corinthos and Carly Benson|Sonny and Carly]] ([[Maurice Benard]] and [[Tamara Braun]])'s first divorce in 2001, Sonny legally adopts Michael. In 2002 and 2003, respectively, Michael (Dylan Cash) gets a half-sister, [[Kristina Davis]], and a brother, [[Morgan Corinthos]]. In February 2005, A.J. and [[Faith Rosco]] ([[Cynthia Preston]]) kidnap Michael, Morgan (George Juarez) and Kristina (Kali Rodriguez). A.J. fakes Michael's death and attempts to turn him against his parents. Jason and girlfriend [[Sam McCall]] ([[Kelly Monaco]]) manage to save him. Michael witnesses A.J.'s  supposed murder in 2005 and is initially believed to have killed him. Michael makes several attempts to reunite his parents, but eventually forms a bond with his stepfather [[Jasper Jacks]] ([[Ingo Rademacher]]). When a serial killer begins terrorizing Port Charles, claiming the lives of Emily ([[Natalia Livingston]]) and, his nanny Leticia (Jessi Morales), and almost his mother, Michael takes it upon himself to protect his family by purchasing a gun. After [[#Multiple shootings and coma|accidentally shooting]] his father's girlfriend [[Kate Howard]] ([[Megan Ward]]), Michael runs away from home. When he and Carly ([[Laura Wright]]) are reunited in a local warehouse, they are nearly killed in an explosion. Michael is rendered comatose in April 2008 after being shot in the head when a sniper tries to kill Sonny after the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis that occurred by Michael's evil uncle and Sonny's enemy [[Jerry Jacks]] ([[Sebastian Roché]]) because Michael was a kid back then when that event claimed the life of his grandfather [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]) and Michael was told by authorities not to go inside because Sonny and Monica could end up losing Michael as well.

===2009–11===
After the risky surgery, Michael wakes up exhibiting uncontrollable fits of rage. Carly, who is dealing with a high-risk pregnancy, agrees to send Michael to live with the Quartermaines. Believing his family will be better off, Michael and Kristina ([[Lexi Ainsworth]]) skip town when he mistakenly believes that he caused Claudia (Sarah Brown)'s miscarriage. The teens soon return, and Michael suddenly begins uncovering memories from the coma. He also discovers that he has potential for psychic dreams, and consults a psychic for help on both issues. His abilities later fade as a plot point due to emotional traumas Michael would soon face. Michael is on his way out of town when he discovers Claudia's car abandoned on the side of the road. Trying to stop Claudia from stealing a newborn Josslyn, [[#Claudia's murder|Michael kills her]] and is forced to keep quiet. When Sonny is arrested for Claudia's murder, Michael's attempt to confess goes unnoticed and he is soon sent to Sonny's island. However, Dante ([[Dominic Zamprogna]]) finds Michael and brings him back to [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]] where he confesses under oath to Claudia's murder. Michael is sent to prison, but Jason later pleads guilty to a felony with the condition that he receive the same sentence and will share a cell with Michael in order to protect him. Dante manages to work out a deal getting Michael released on parole. To get some &quot;experience&quot; before going out with Kristina's best friend, Ali (Maitland McConnell), Michael begins seeing Abby ([[Andrea Bogart]]). After stopping Brandon's attempted assault on Abby, Michael confesses that he was raped in prison. Michael temporarily goes to work for ELQ to help Abby get a job. When Abby suddenly dies due to an unfortunate pedestrian-meets-construction mishap after Michael sends Abby out of town to protect her from a rapist loose in Port Charles, Michael is understandably and completely devastated, yet rises once more from tragedy to honor her memory by going to college because [[Anthony Zacchara]] ([[Bruce Weitz]]) is still alive after that.

===2012–14===
Michael befriends a grieving [[Starr Manning]] ([[Kristen Alderson]]) after his failed attempt to save her daughter and boyfriend, and they soon start dating. Meanwhile, Michael clashes with Kristina's reality show producer [[Trey Mitchell]] (Erik Valdez) because of his friendship with Starr. As the family mourns the deaths of Jason and Michael's great-grandfather [[Edward Quartermaine]] ([[John Ingle]]), Michael becomes the center of yet another battle between Sonny, Carly and a very much alive A.J. ([[Sean Kanan]]). Michael bonds with A.J., hoping to build a relationship with him. Together, Michael and A.J. remove [[Tracy Quartermaine]] ([[Jane Elliot]]) as CEO of ELQ, allowing A.J. to take her place. Starr suddenly leaves town and dumps Michael over the phone. Michael gets drunk and wakes up in bed with Sonny's ex-wife [[Brenda Barrett]] ([[Vanessa Marcil]]), believing they have slept together; it's later revealed that they didn't. 

Michael welcomes Morgan ([[Bryan Craig]]) and his scheming girlfriend [[Kiki Jerome]] (also played by Alderson) into his home. Michael and Kiki initially clash, but soon fall for each other and kiss. They are soon led to believe they are cousins when Kiki is revealed to be [[Franco (General Hospital)|Franco]]'s ([[Roger Howarth]]) long lost daughter. By the time their connection is proven false, Morgan and Kiki have eloped. When Kate ([[Kelly Sullivan (actress)|Kelly Sullivan]]) is murdered, A.J. is the prime suspect and Michael defends his innocence. At Morgan and Kiki's reception, a grieving Sonny reveals that Morgan knew Kiki and Michael weren't related, and he married her so Kiki would not leave him for Michael. A furious Morgan blames his family for favoring Michael. Michael and Kiki start dating when she dumps Morgan. 

Michael is devastated when a drunken A.J. is murdered trying to clear his name and [[Carlos Rivera]] ([[Jeffrey Vincent Parise]]) is convicted of the crime. Michael later learns that his great uncle [[Luke Spencer]] ([[Anthony Geary]]) has been hitting on Kiki, even though he is engaged to Tracy. Tracy's son [[Ned Ashton (General Hospital)|Ned Ashton]] ([[Wally Kurth]]) suspects that Luke is after the company, and together, he and Michael fire Tracy from ELQ and Michael replaces her as CEO. Michael hires Morgan and Kiki to oversee ELQ's renovations of The Brownstone in exchange for free room and board. Meanwhile, Michael and Tracy reconcile and he welcomes her back to the company. 

Michael discovers that Rivera is not A.J.'s killer and starts digging for answers. As Carly is set to marry Franco, Michael learns that Sonny killed A.J., and Carly helped him cover it up. Michael holds Sonny at gunpoint, ready to kill him, but his brothers talk him down. Michael disowns Kiki and Morgan upon discovering that they knew about Sonny's involvement in A.J.'s murder. Michael gets drunk and has a one-night stand with Rosalie Martinez (Linda Elena Tovar). Kiki discovers them in bed together, and Michael dumps her on the spot.

===2015–===
Sonny is sent to prison for A.J.'s murder, and Michael decides to change his last name to Quartermaine, distancing himself from Carly and Morgan. Sonny breaks out of jail when Luke threatens Michael, and saves Michael and several others from being killed by a bomb Luke planted. Michael starts to soften towards Sonny again until the governor grants Sonny a pardon for saving his daughter from the bomb, releasing Sonny from prison. Michael is furious, and, as revenge, Michael sues for custody of Sonny's newborn daughter [[Avery Corinthos|Avery]]. Michael brings up Sonny's past and his own shooting, depicting Sonny as an unfit parent, and wins custody of Avery.

Michael hires &quot;Jake Doe&quot; ([[Billy Miller (actor)|Billy Miller]]) and Rosalie as employees at ELQ, and hires [[Sabrina Santiago]] ([[Teresa Castillo]]) as a nanny for Avery. However, Michael finds out that Rosalie is helping [[Nikolas Cassadine]] ([[Tyler Christopher (actor)|Tyler Christopher]]) take over ELQ by stealing stocks. Nikolas gains a majority hold in ELQ, and ousts Michael as CEO. Michael, meanwhile, starts a relationship with Sabrina. She convinces him to try and reconcile with his parents, and Michael gives Avery back to Sonny. He also supports his parents when they get re-married, and supports Carly when Sonny is shot and left paralyzed. He becomes part of the family again, making decisions when Sonny is recovering in the hospital. When Avery's mother, [[Ava Jerome]] ([[Maura West]]), is released from prison and gets custody of Avery, Michael supports Sonny. 

Sabrina finds out she is pregnant, and Michael is excited to be a father. However, Michael later finds out that Carlos is the baby's father, and is upset at Sabrina for lying to him. She leaves town before Michael has the chance to make amends with her. He later gets a note from Sabrina saying she's not coming back. Michael discovers that &quot;Jake&quot; is actually Jason, alive with a new face. Hoping to get ELQ back, he and Tracy sue Nikolas with Jason's help. However, Jason manages to buy out the ELQ stocks from Nikolas. He gives Michael back his position as CEO, and ELQ back to the Quartermaines. Carlos is arrested and brought back to Port Charles, and Michael asks him where Sabrina is. Carlos refuses to give up Sabrina's location, and escapes from police custody. Michael finds Carlos after he is stabbed by [[Julian Jerome]] ([[William deVry]]), and brings Carlos to GH. Carlos dies before he can reveal where Sabrina is. Michael still gets Sonny's help to find Sabrina. When Sabrina's son shows up at the Quartermaine mansion, Michael realizes Sabrina is in trouble. He and Sonny head to Puerto Rico, and rescue Sabrina from her captor. He reunites her with her son, and the two mend their relationship.

Michael's newfound happiness with Sabrina and her son, [[Children of General Hospital#Teddy Rivera|Teddy]], is shattered when Sabrina is murdered. Michael gives Teddy to [[List of General Hospital characters#R|Joe Rivera]] (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), Carlos' brother, who takes his nephew back to Puerto Rico. Unfortunately, Michael is dealt another devastating blow soon after when Morgan is killed in a car bombing meant for Julian. Sonny is suspected by many, including Michael, until Jason finds evidence that proves him innocent. Michael, meanwhile, starts to grow close with Nelle Hayes (Chloe Lanier), the kidney donor who saved Michael's sister, Josslyn.

===Casting===
According to ''General Hospital'' casting director, [[Mark Teschner]], Benard was one of the few actors being considered for the role. Benard came in for a meeting with Wendy Riche, and the two immediately clicked. It was only a matter of how long it would take to get Benard on screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOU100593&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Favorite Son|pages=39–40|first=Damon|last=Romine|date=October 5, 1993|work=[[Soap Opera Update]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the character was only supposed to last for six months as Benard was not interested in anything more than a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVSM080912&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvsourcemagazine.com/2012/08/2858-interview-maurice-benard-general-hospital-life-future/|title=Interview With A Mobster: 'General Hospital's' Maurice Benard On The Changes In Sonny's Life and GH's Future|date=August 9, 2012|first=Omar|last=Nobles|work=TV Source Magazine|publisher=SoSource Media LLC|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benard revealed that after his stint on ''[[All My Children]]'', he was not interested in doing another soap.

The producers offered him two separate roles, that of mobster [[Damian Smith (General Hospital)|Damian Smith]], with a two-year contract, and that of Sonny. In addition the role being short term, Benard also chose the role because he liked the character's name.&lt;ref name=&quot;WLS2010P1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2010/12/maurice-benard1.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Maurice Benard Interview, Part 1|date=December 23, 2010|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[We Love Soaps]]|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benard revealed that just two weeks after starting work, he suffered a manic depressive breakdown.

The parallels between the story and Benard's real life experiences had Benard believing he was having his own &quot;fourth break down,&quot; though Benard credits staying on his medication as keeping him grounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPMAG&quot;/&gt; His willingness to integrate his real life medical condition into Sonny's storylines have raised visibility of the disease, leading to Benard appearing on shows such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' to discuss the disease as well as being the spokesman for the [[Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Melissa |last=Castellanos |authorlink= |title=Reality Is The Method For GH's Benard |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/02/entertainment/main4145963.shtml |work=CBS News |publisher=CBS Interactive |date=3 June 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
Sonny came to Port Charles in 1993, running a strip club for [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]]. He becomes involved with [[Karen Wexler]], and gets her addicted to drugs to get her to work for him. Meanwhile, Sonny begins dating the young [[Brenda Barrett]], the beginning of a popular Supercouple for the soap. He also befriends [[Stone Cates]], [[Robin Scorpio]] and Frank's longtime employee, [[Luke Spencer]]. Brenda, who is more attracted to Sonny than to his mob ties, introduces him to an old Bensonhurst friend, Lois Cerullo, who needed Sonny's money to finance a record label. The romance of Sonny and Brenda takes off amidst their new business relationship as partners of the record label, L&amp;B. Sonny travels to [[Puerto Rico]] to work security for L&amp;B artist [[Miguel Morez]]. He informs the locals that Miguel is under the protection of Frank Smith's organization. Miguel soon begins flirting with a now-model Brenda, which makes Sonny jealous. While Brenda and Miguel bond, Sonny opens up to her about his abusive childhood at the hands of his step-father, Deke. The two reconcile.

Luke kills Frank to protect Sonny, and Sonny informs Frank's partner, Hernando Rivera, that he is taking over Frank's organization. Rivera kidnaps his daughter, Lily, Miguel, Sonny and Brenda; they later escape and return to the U.S. After they are rushed to safety, Sonny plots his next move, pretending to leave the mafia. Due to mafia ties, Sonny and Luke's club is blown up; that same night, Sonny discovers that Luke's driver, Mike Corbin, is actually his father, Michael Corinthos, Sr. After Stone is diagnosed with [[AIDS]], Sonny takes him in. Sonny learned that Frank's son, [[Damian Smith (General Hospital)|Damian]], is working with Joe Scully to sabotage shipments from Deception cosmetics. Sonny is reticent to take action against Scully, as he is the man responsible for saving Sonny from his abusive step father. During a confrontation at the docks, Mike is shot, and Sonny kills Scully, who was attempting to finish Mike off. Scully's henchmen go after Brenda, Stone and the [[Spencer family (General Hospital)|Spencers]], looking for revenge. Lily learns that Brenda is planning to record Sonny discussing his mob business and hand it over to the police.

Sonny is arrested and Lily turns to her father, reconciling with him in exchange for his help. Rivera makes a deal that he will keep Sonny out of prison if he marries Lily. Sonny marries Lily, though Lily realizes that Sonny still loves Brenda and offers a divorce. Sonny refuses to leave Lily because he fears reprisals from Rivera, though he finds it hard to deny his feelings for Brenda. Instead, he takes Lily on a second honeymoon. After being trapped in an avalanche at a ski resort on the honeymoon, Brenda and Sonny agree to reconcile. However, Lily reveals she's pregnant before Sonny can ask for a divorce. Brenda lets Sonny go, acknowledging his need to be an available father. Sonny and Brenda kiss passionately and declare their undying love for each other. Much to Sonny's dismay, Brenda moves on with [[Jasper Jacks|Jasper &quot;Jax&quot; Jacks]]. Sadly, Lily dies in a car bombing targeting Sonny, killing her and the baby. Sonny finds out Rivera was responsible, and helps him die, later taking over Rivera's organization. Upon Lily's death, Sonny inherited 30 million dollars, which he donated to General Hospital to create a hospital wing in Stone's name.

When [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason Morgan]] suffers brain damage after a car accident, he confides in Sonny. Jason would later become Sonny's enforcer and closest friend. On Jax and Brenda's wedding day, Sonny shows up with Jax's wife, Miranda Jameson, who was believed to be dead. After Jax leaves Brenda to make sense of it all, Brenda and Sonny reconcile. When attempting to save Brenda, Sonny is drugged. When Sonny is brought to the hospital, Sonny tells Brenda he loves her. Believing her marriage with Jax can work, she rejects Sonny. Lily's former lover, Harry Silver, arrives in town causing problems for Brenda and Sonny, leading Sonny to kill him. Fearing the mob life is too dangerous for him and Brenda, he offers to marry her and leave town together. Sonny declares that he loves his life and has worked hard for it, but he loves Brenda more. After a nightmare where Brenda is blown up in a car bomb, Sonny decides he'd rather lose Brenda than see her die. Sonny sends Jason to the altar to end things for him. Sonny leaves town soon after his aborted wedding with Brenda.

'''Constanzia &quot;Connie&quot; Corleone''' is a [[fictional character]] in ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'', a novel by [[Mario Puzo]] and the 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]''. In the film, Connie is portrayed by [[Talia Shire]], the sister of director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Shire was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her portrayal of Connie Corleone in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlineathens.com/stories/032109/mar_412675296.shtml#.VoqRDrYrJdg Talia Shire opens up about The Godfather] accessed 1-4-2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destinationhollywood.com/movies/godfather/character_conniecorleone.shtml Spotlight on Connie Corleone] accessed 1-4-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Godfather'' ==
Born in 1925, Connie is the youngest child and only daughter of [[mafia]] [[Don (honorific)|don]] [[Vito Corleone]] and [[Carmela Corleone]]. She is the sister of [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]], [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] and [[Michael Corleone]]. She marries Sonny's friend [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo Rizzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/09/talia-shire-hollywood-interview.html Talia Shire interview] accessed 1-4-2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father was very displeased that Connie married a man who was not only half northern Italian, but also had a criminal history.  He only agreed to the marriage on condition that they hold an old-style Sicilian wedding.

Carlo, who Puzo characterizes as &quot;a punk sore at the world&quot;, periodically [[domestic violence|abuses]] and cheats on Connie in frustration at being shunted aside by the Corleone family. The night of their wedding turned out to be a harbinger of things to come; he gave Connie a black eye when she refused to give him a purse containing cash gifts from the wedding guests. 

After one particularly bad beating, Connie complains to her father, who refuses to help.  The book reveals that in truth, Vito was outraged at how Carlo treated Connie, but felt powerless to interfere; Italian tradition forbade a father from interfering in a daughter's marriage.  Connie's family grew to resent Carlo and his mistreatment of Connie, especially her oldest brother Sonny. One day, when Sonny visits Connie, he finds her in tears and a bruised face. Sonny chases and beats up Carlo in the street, threatening to kill Carlo if he hurts Connie again. 

Corleone rivals [[Emilio Barzini]] and [[Philip Tattaglia]] recruit Carlo to bring Sonny into the open. Carlo has a mistress call the house and a fight with Connie ensues that ends with Carlo again beating Connie. Connie calls the Corleone compound asking Sonny for help. An enraged Sonny drives off alone to help Connie, leaving his bodyguards following in a separate car. At a toll booth Sonny is shot and killed by Barzini's [[Tommy gun]]-wielding men.

Michael returns from Sicily and takes Sonny's place as Vito's heir apparent. When Vito dies, Michael becomes the new Don and avenges Sonny's murder by having the heads of the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] killed and Carlo [[garrote]]d by [[Peter Clemenza]]. Connie flies into a rage when she finds out Carlo is dead and blames Michael, denouncing him in front of his wife [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]].

== ''The Godfather Part II'' ==
In ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Connie has remarried, divorced, and had affairs. She remains bitter toward Michael and announces that she intends to marry Merle Johnson, which Michael disapproves of. At the end of the film, Connie returns for her mother's funeral, having forgiven Michael. She intercedes on Fredo's behalf after Michael disowns him for conspiring with Corleone rival [[Hyman Roth]], pleading with Michael to forgive him. Michael publicly appears to forgive Fredo. Connie later says that Fredo had drowned, unaware that Michael had him killed. After Michael and Kay divorce, Connie helps care for Michael's two children, [[Anthony Corleone|Anthony]] and [[Mary Corleone|Mary]].  In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] at the end of the film, it is revealed that Sonny introduced her to Carlo in 1941 during Vito's birthday party.

== ''The Godfather Part III'' ==
In ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', Connie is very close to her nephew [[Vincent Corleone|Vincent Mancini]], Sonny's illegitimate son with [[Lucy Mancini]]. Connie encourages Michael to bring Vincent into the Corleone family and support him in his feud with [[Joey Zasa]]. When Michael suffers a diabetic stroke and recuperates in the hospital Connie and [[Al Neri]] give Vincent the approval to kill Zasa. Connie travels with the Corleone family to Sicily. She tells Vincent to prepare a counterattack if Michael is killed. Connie encourages the aging Michael to name Vincent the new Don. Connie is still unaware that Michael had Fredo killed and says it was God's will that Fredo drowned by accident. She attends the opera, along with the entire Corleone family, in Palermo where her nephew [[Anthony Corleone|Anthony]] performs. On discovering that her godfather [[Don Altobello]] has been behind the plot against their family, she kills him by giving him a gift of poisoned cannoli. Connie is last shown crying when her niece [[Mary Corleone|Mary]] is killed by an assassin intending to kill Michael.

==In other media==
Connie appears as a supporting character in [[Mark Winegardner]]'s [[sequel]] novels ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'' and ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]''.

'''Fredo (Frederico) Corleone''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. Fredo is portrayed by [[United States|American]] actor [[John Cazale]] in the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] [[The Godfather|film adaptation]] and in the sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

He is the second son of the [[mafia]] [[Don (honorific)|don]] [[Vito Corleone]] ([[Marlon Brando]] and [[Robert De Niro]]). Fredo is the younger brother of [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] ([[James Caan]]) and the elder brother to [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] ([[Al Pacino]]) and sister, [[Connie Corleone|Connie]] ([[Talia Shire]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20078/The-Godfather-Part-II/cast|title=The Godfather, Part II (1974)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both Puzo's novel and the film adaptations, Fredo is characterized as weaker and less intelligent than his brothers; he therefore has little real power or status within the [[Corleone family|Corleone crime family]]. The infant Fredo had [[pneumonia]]. In the novel, Fredo's primary weakness is his womanizing, a habit he develops after moving to Las Vegas and which earns his father's disfavor. In the films, Fredo's feelings of personal inadequacy and his inability to act effectively on his own behalf are character flaws leading to greater consequences.

==Appearances==

===''The Godfather''===
In a pivotal scene in the novel and film, Fredo is with his father when assassins working for drug kingpin [[Virgil Sollozzo]] ([[Al Lettieri]]) gun down Don Corleone in the street. Fredo, terrified, drops his gun, failing to return fire. He sits on the curb next to his severely wounded father, weeping. In the novel, Fredo is sickened after witnessing his father being shot, going into [[acute stress reaction|shock]]. To aid Fredo's recovery and protect him from possible reprisals, Sonny sends his younger brother to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] under the protection of Don Anthony Molinari of San Francisco. While in Las Vegas, Fredo learns the [[casino]] trade and becomes acquainted with former [[hitman]] [[Moe Greene]] ([[Alex Rocco]]), who runs a major Vegas hotel that the Corleone family bankrolled. When Fredo's womanizing starts affecting business, Greene slaps him in public. 

After Sonny is assassinated, Vito chooses Michael as his successor of the [[Corleone Family]]. This creates a lasting rift between the two surviving brothers. When Michael learns that Greene slapped Fredo, he is angered and confronts Greene, but is also dismayed that Fredo has fallen under Greene's influence. Michael berates Fredo for openly taking sides against the family during a meeting with Greene, warning him never to do so again.

===''The Godfather Part II''===
[[Image:Cazale Godfather2.jpg|thumb|Fredo in ''The Godfather Part II'']]
By the beginning of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Fredo has become Michael's [[underboss]], though he has nominal power. During a large family gathering, Fredo is unable to control his intoxicated wife, Deanna Dunn ([[Marianna Hill]]). When she dances and flirts with another man, he furiously drags her off the dance floor and threatens to hit her, though Deanna drunkenly mocks him until one of Michael's staff hauls her away.

Hagen is ordered to bring Senator [[Pat Geary]] ([[G.D. Spradlin]]) under the Corleone Family's control to gain his assistance in obtaining gambling licenses. After the senator refuses to help, he is implicated in a [[prostitute]]'s murder, which the film implies was a setup by Michael to bring the senator to heel. Hagen offers the Corleone family's help in eliminating the problem in exchange for the senator's &quot;friendship&quot;. Hagen tells Geary that Fredo operates the [[brothel]], and &quot;it will be as if she never existed&quot;. Geary agrees to their terms.

Fredo later betrays Michael after being approached by [[Johnny Ola]] ([[Dominic Chianese]]), an associate of rival gangster [[Hyman Roth]] ([[Lee Strasberg]]). Ola and Roth tell Fredo that Michael is being particularly difficult in business negotiations between Roth's organization and the Corleone family. Fredo secretly agrees to aid them in exchange for compensation; the film never reveals what specific assistance Fredo provides Ola and Roth against Michael, what he was offered in return, or whether he knew that Roth's men would make an attempt on Michael's life.

While in [[Havana]] negotiating with Roth, Michael discovers that Fredo is the family traitor behind the assassination attempt on him. After previously telling Michael that he had never met Ola, Fredo carelessly blurts out to another person that they had met. Michael confronts his brother, delivering the [[kiss of death (mafia)|kiss of death]]. Amid the chaos of American-backed dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] fleeing [[Fidel Castro]]'s rebel army, Michael pleads with Fredo to leave the country with him. Frightened, Fredo runs away into the crowd. Michael's men eventually locate Fredo and convince him to return home. 

Michael is indicted by a [[United States Senate|Senate]] subcommittee investigating [[organized crime]]. Michael's former ''[[caporegime]]'', [[Frank Pentangeli]] ([[Michael V. Gazzo]]), is scheduled to testify against Michael at the hearing. A few days before the hearing, Michael asks Fredo what he knows regarding Roth's plans. Fredo says that, if he helped Roth, &quot;there was something in it for me, on my own&quot;. He tells Michael that he resented being passed over to succeed their father; he believes that, as the older brother, he should have taken over the family business. When pressed by Michael, Fredo reveals that the Senate commission's lawyer is on Roth's payroll. Michael disowns Fredo, and privately instructs [[Al Neri]] ([[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]]) that nothing is to happen to Fredo while [[Carmela Corleone|their mother]] is alive; the implication being that Fredo will be killed after her death. At their mother's funeral, and at their sister Connie's urging, Michael seemingly forgives Fredo. However, it is a ploy to gain Fredo's trust. Soon after, while Fredo and Neri are fishing on Lake Tahoe, Neri executes him as Michael watches from his house.

Fredo makes a final appearance in the movie's penultimate scene, a flashback to December 1941. It emerges that Fredo was the only family member supporting Michael's decision to drop out of college and join the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

===''The Godfather Part III''===
Fredo appears only once in [[The Godfather Part III|the third film]], in a flashback depicting his death through archive footage. He is also mentioned many times throughout the film; the dialogue makes it clear that Michael is tormented with guilt over ordering his brother's death, and that it has alienated him from his ex-wife, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] ([[Diane Keaton]]), and his son, [[Anthony Corleone|Anthony]] ([[Franc D'Ambrosio]]), both of whom know what really happened. Michael himself cries out Fredo's name while having a [[diabetic coma]] due to [[diabetic hypoglycemia]].  Later in the film, he breaks down in tears while confessing having ordered Fredo's death to [[Cardinal Lamberto]] ([[Raf Vallone]]), who later becomes [[Pope John Paul I]]. Michael's daughter, [[Mary Corleone|Mary]] ([[Sofia Coppola]]), asks her cousin and love interest, [[Vincent Corleone]] ([[Andy García]]), if Michael had Fredo killed, but Vincent says it is &quot;just a story&quot; and changes the subject.

===Sequel novels===

====In ''The Godfather Returns''====
[[Mark Winegardner]]'s novel ''[[The Godfather Returns]]'' further expands upon the character of Fredo Corleone.  It includes explanations for some questions left open by the films, such as the details of Fredo's betrayal of Michael in ''The Godfather Part II'', and how, as was revealed in ''The Godfather Part III'', Anthony knew the truth about Fredo's death.

The novel reveals that Fredo is [[bisexual]], and implies that he was [[child molestation|molested]] as a child by his parish priest. Rival gangster [[Louie Russo]] exploits rumours of Fredo's sexuality to make Michael look weak, and tries to have him killed while he is with a male lover. The novel also reveals that, in San Francisco, Fredo beats one of his lovers to death after the man recognizes him from a newspaper photo. Hagen covers up the resulting scandal by claiming Fredo killed the man in self-defense. Fredo also has liaisons with many women, having &quot;knocked up half the cocktail waitresses in Las Vegas&quot;. He meets Marguerite &quot;Rita&quot; Duvall, who [[Johnny Fontane]] sent to his room as a prank. Though hesitant, they have sex, and Fredo pays her to tell Johnny it was the best she had ever had.

At [[Colma, California|Colma]] during the funeral for Don Molinari of San Francisco, Fredo gets the idea of setting up a [[necropolis]] in [[New Jersey]]. The Corleone family would buy the former cemetery land, now prime [[real estate]], and also be a silent partner in the graveyard business. Fredo proposes his plan to Michael, wanting to impress and convince him and others of his abilities. Michael, however, dismisses the plan as unrealistic.

Fredo arrives at the Corleone Christmas party with Deanna Dunn, a fading movie starlet. A few months later they are married. Dunn gets Fredo bit parts in some of her movies. Later, in September 1957, Fredo's [[Hollywood]] connections allow him to get his own unsuccessful TV show, &quot;The Fred Corleone Show&quot;, which airs irregularly, usually on Monday nights, until his death. Meanwhile, Fredo's [[alcoholism]] worsens. He discovers Deanna cheating on him with her co-star, and shoots up the car he bought her. When Deanna's co-star tries to attack him, Fredo knocks him unconscious and is arrested. Hagen bails him out, and they get in an argument about Fredo's recklessness and Hagen's blind loyalty to Michael.  Despite this, Hagen gets Fredo cleared by claiming the incident was self-defense.

Roth, Ola and traitorous Corleone family ''[[caporegime]]'' [[Nick Geraci]] use Fredo as a pawn to eliminate Michael. Geraci and Ola meet with Fredo, who is blind drunk after having a fight with his wife, and promise to make his necropolis idea a reality in return for information about Michael. Fredo supplies them with information about the Corleone family, particularly financial interests.

Fredo's death plays out as it was filmed in ''The Godfather Part II''. Anthony, about to go fishing with his uncle, is called away by his aunt Connie to go to Reno. He actually never leaves and instead, he is sent to his room, where, from his window, he sees Fredo and Neri out on the lake. Anthony hears a gunshot and sees Neri returning alone, explaining ''Godfather Part III''{{'}}s revelation that Anthony knows that Michael had Fredo killed.

====In ''The Godfather's Revenge''====
In Winegardner's 2006 sequel, ''[[The Godfather's Revenge]]'', Fredo appears in one of Michael's dreams, warning him about an unspecified threat and asking him why he had his own brother killed. Much of the novel portrays Michael dealing with his guilt over Fredo's murder.

In the final chapter of the book, Michael learns that Fredo had an illegitimate child with Michael's ex-girlfriend Rita Duvall.

'''Santino &quot;Sonny&quot; Corleone''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Mario Puzo]]'s 1969 novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' and its [[The Godfather|1972 film adaptation]]. The character also appears in various flashback sequences in the film's 1974 sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

In the novel and film, he is the oldest son of the [[mafia]] [[Don (honorific)|don]] [[Vito Corleone]] and [[Carmela Corleone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/the_godfather/5.html|title=Fact and Fiction in The Godfather |publisher=[[crimelibrary.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two brothers, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] and [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], a sister, [[Connie Corleone|Connie]], and an adopted brother, [[Tom Hagen]]. In the film, Sonny was portrayed by [[James Caan]], who reprised his role for a flashback scene in ''Part II''. Director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s son [[Roman Coppola]] played Sonny as a boy in the 1920s scene of that film.

==Novel and film biography==
In both the novel and the movie, Sonny is the eldest of Vito Corleone's four children (born in 1916), and depicted as the most volatile and confrontational. He is heavily involved in his father's [[Corleone crime family|crime family]]. At age 16, Sonny committed a robbery. When Sonny's godfather, [[Peter Clemenza]] informed Vito about it, Vito demanded his son explain himself. Sonny said he had witnessed Vito murder the feared &quot;[[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]]&quot; gangster [[Don Fanucci]]. He now wants to sell olive oil like his father. Vito, understanding that Sonny wanted to join the [[Corleone crime family]], sent him to Clemenza for training.

Sonny &quot;made his bones&quot; when he was 19. By his mid-20s, he was promoted to a ''[[caporegime]]'' in the Corleone family. By the end of [[World War II]], he is his father's [[underboss]] and heir apparent, respected and feared as a merciless killer with a fiery temper. Sonny also possesses a more patient side; at age 11, he brought home a [[homeless]] boy, [[Tom Hagen]], demanding he be allowed to live with the family. Hagen eventually rises through the ranks to become Vito's ''[[consigliere]]''. As the eldest child, Sonny acts as protector to his younger siblings and has a close relationship with his youngest brother, Michael and only sister, Connie. The novel shows he is unable to harm women, children, or anyone unable to defend themselves. This trait probably saved Connie's abusive husband, [[Carlo Rizzi (The Godfather)|Carlo Rizzi]], from being fatally beaten by Sonny when Carlo refuses to fight back.

Sonny is married to [[Sandra Corleone|Sandra]] with whom he has four children, but he has several mistresses, including [[Lucy Mancini]], who was Connie's bridesmaid. In the novel, Sandra ignores his infidelities because she is unable to tolerate his enormous penis.

Sonny’s life is upturned in 1945, when [[Virgil Sollozzo|Virgil &quot;The Turk&quot; Sollozzo]], backed by the [[Tattaglia family]], approaches Vito with an offer to enter the [[narcotics]] trade. During the meeting, Sonny spontaneously speaks out-of-turn, expressing an interest in the deal that Vito had declined. Vito later reprimands Sonny for revealing his thoughts to an outsider. Sollozzo later attempts to have Vito [[assassination|assassinated]], believing Sonny, as his father's successor, will bring the Corleone family into the drug trade.

The failed assassination attempt leaves Vito near death, making Sonny acting boss of the Corleone family. Sonny orders Clemenza to execute Vito's traitorous bodyguard [[Paulie Gatto (The Godfather)|Paulie Gatto]]. Sollozzo mounts a second assassination attempt on Vito at the hospital that Sonny's youngest brother [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] thwarts. Sonny then orders [[Bruno Tattaglia]], son and underboss of Sollozzo's ally [[Philip Tattaglia]], to be murdered. Sollozzo proposes that Michael to be sent to hear a truce proposition. Sonny, believing it is a trick, refuses and demands that the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Tom successfully convinces Sonny to wait because [[Captain McCluskey (The Godfather)|Captain Mark McCluskey]], a corrupt NYPD captain on Sollozzo's payroll, has agreed to be Sollozzo's bodyguard. Tom warns Sonny that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule not to kill members of law enforcement: the backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement would be severe. Michael advises Sonny that Sollozzo will never honor the deal and will likely make another assassination attempt on their father to remove Vito's opposition to the drug trade. Clemenza agrees with Michael's theory.

Michael, who distanced himself from the family's criminal activity, volunteers to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey, arguing that McCluskey is fair game because he is a corrupt cop mixed up in the drug trade. Sonny, amused by Michael's proposal but also impressed by his family loyalty and bravery, initially doubts that his &quot;nice college boy&quot; brother is capable of murder. Ultimately he approves the hit. Michael meets with Sollozzo and McCluskey at an Italian restaurant in the Bronx where he fatally shoots both men. This ignites the New York underworld's first Mafia war in a decade. Sonny had arranged for Michael to flee to [[Sicily]] under the protection of Vito's friend and partner [[Don Tommasino]].

The war between the Five Families drags on, and Sonny, unable to break the stalemate, orders bloody raids that earn him a legendary reputation. Sonny had considered wiping out all of the Five Families' Dons in one stroke. [[Emilio Barzini]] had to resort to an elaborate scheme to lure Sonny into the open. He enlists Sonny's brother-in-law, Carlo, to help set a trap. Earlier, Sonny had severely beaten up Carlo upon learning that he had been [[domestic violence|physically abusing]] Connie. To draw Sonny out into the open, Carlo provokes Connie into an argument before savagely beating her. Weeping and injured, she telephones the Corleone compound asking Sonny for help. Furious, Sonny speeds towards Connie's apartment in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] ahead of his bodyguards. At the [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]] Causeway toll plaza, rival mobsters emerge with [[Thompson submachine gun|tommy guns]] and fatally ambush Sonny.

During a meeting with the Dons of the other crime families to establish peace, Vito realizes that Barzini masterminded Sonny's murder. After Michael returns from Sicily, he takes Sonny's place as Vito's heir apparent. Vito and Michael secretly plot to wipe out the other New York Dons to avenge Sonny's death. The plan is successfully executed in 1955, after Vito's death from natural causes. Michael informs Carlo that the rival Dons have been killed and coerces Carlo's confession for his part in arranging Sonny's murder. Carlo admits Barzini was the mastermind. On Michael's orders, Clemenza strangles Carlo with a wire. In a single strike, the Corleones become the most powerful crime family in the country.

== Role in ''Godfather'' sequels ==
As well as appearing in the original film, ''[[The Godfather]]'', Sonny features in the sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. In this film, he briefly appears in some [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback scenes]] as an infant and as a young child. He makes a final appearance at the end of the story, in a scene that portrays Vito's birthday celebration in 1941. Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and enlisted to fight in World War II. Sonny is furious at the decision, and he berates his brother for risking his life &quot;for a bunch of strangers.&quot; This flashback also reveals that Sonny introduced Carlo to Connie, and the rest of the family, which led to their marriage.

In ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', [[Vincent Corleone]] is introduced as Sonny's illegitimate son with [[Lucy Mancini]]. Vincent succeeds Michael as head of the Corleone family at the end of the film. Vincent's existence in the film contradicts the [[fictional universe|literary universe]], as Puzo's original novel stated that Lucy never bore a child with Sonny.

== Behind the scenes ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

* Coppola staged Sonny's death scene in ''The Godfather'' to be reminiscent of the final death scene of [[Clyde Barrow]] ([[Warren Beatty]]) and [[Bonnie Parker]] ([[Faye Dunaway]]) in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|title=Godfather: The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola|date=May 18, 2014|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|isbn=9780813146713|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coppola had the car radio play the broadcast of the baseball playoff game won by [[Bobby Thomson]] hitting the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard Round the World]].  This would place Sonny's death on October 3, 1951, contradicting the novel by several years.
* Among the actors auditioning for the role of Michael during casting for ''The Godfather'', one unknown [[off-Broadway]] actor named [[Robert De Niro]] also read for Sonny's part, as well as Michael's and Carlo's, without success. Raw footage of him in the scene where [[Paulie Gatto]] offers to kill Rizzi can be seen on the [[DVD]]. Eventually, Coppola cast Caan in the role and gave De Niro the part of Paulie, but he &quot;traded&quot; him to the film ''[[The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight]]'' for [[Al Pacino]], who soon got the part of Michael. [[Anthony Perkins]] not only auditioned for Sonny, but also for Tom Hagen.
* Originally Caan was to be cast as the main character [[Michael Corleone]] (Sonny's youngest brother), while [[Carmine Caridi]] was signed as Sonny. However Coppola demanded that the role of Michael be played by [[Al Pacino]] instead. The studio agreed to Pacino but insisted on having Caan be cast as Sonny, so he remained in the production.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Seal |first=Mark |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/03/godfather200903 |title=The Godfather Wars &amp;#124; Culture |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Caan was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in the film, competing with co-stars Pacino and [[Robert Duvall]], giving the movie three entries in that category.

== Cultural references ==
* Sonny's death scene has been parodied several times on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including in the final scene of &quot;[[All's Fair in Oven War]]&quot;, an episode in which Caan lent his voice. In that episode, the tollbooth death scene is re-enacted as part of [[Cletus Spuckler]]'s revenge on Caan for &quot;stealing&quot; his wife Brandine's heart. Sonny's death was parodied in the earlier episode &quot;[[Mr. Plow]]&quot;, in a scene where [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is pelted with snowballs by his schoolmates when his father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] clears the snow in front of the school. The scene where Sonny beats Carlo Rizzi has also been parodied, in the episode &quot;[[Strong Arms of the Ma]]&quot;.
* The tollbooth scene was parodied along with the execution montage in the final scene of the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode &quot;Dabba Don&quot;. In this scene the Ant Hill Mob from ''[[Wacky Races]]'' gun down Judge [[Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor|Mightor]] from their car.
* Popular sportswriter [[Bill Simmons]] used to frequently compare the &quot;Sonny Corleone move&quot; to the &quot;Michael Corleone move&quot; when referring to hasty, rash decisions that end badly when a patient, reasoned approach would have been far more successful.  Often, this analogy was applied to free agent signings and trades in the [[NBA]].
* [[Conan O'Brien]] also used the tollbooth scene in a parody on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', explaining how he was dropped from [[NBC]].
* In the HBO series ''[[The Sopranos]]'', the fictional strip club [[Bada Bing]] is named after the catchphrase &quot;bada bing&quot; that Sonny uses to describe an up-close shooting.

'''Vincent Santino Corleone''' ('''[[Given name|né]] Mancini''') is a fictional character in the 1990 feature film ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', in which he is portrayed by [[Andy García]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/20079/The-Godfather-Part-III/cast|title=The Godfather, Part III (1990)|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his performance. Vincent is the illegitimate son of [[Sonny Corleone]] and his mistress [[Lucy Mancini]]. He eventually succeeds his uncle [[Michael Corleone|Michael]] as head of the [[Corleone family]]. [[Retroactive continuity]] (&quot;retcon&quot;) was employed to create the character's existence for ''The Godfather Part III'', as it is evident from [[Mario Puzo]]'s [[The Godfather (novel)|original novel]] that Lucy did not conceive a child with Sonny.

Coppola has said that Vincent is, roughly speaking, an amalgamation of the five Corleone family males, having [[Vito Corleone|Vito]]'s cunning, [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]'s ruthlessness, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]]'s sensitivity, [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]'s fiery temper and [[Tom Hagen]]'s absolute loyalty.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== ''The Godfather Part III'' ===
In ''[[The Godfather]]'', [[Sonny Corleone]] and [[Lucy Mancini]] were having an illicit affair; Vincent Mancini is the result of that union. Being illegitimate, as a youth he was not included in the [[Corleone family]]. When [[Michael Corleone]] offers him employment in one of the family's legitimate businesses, Vincent declines, preferring to work for [[Joey Zasa]], who runs the remnants of the Corleone family's criminal empire in [[New York City]]. Vincent is eventually embroiled in a feud with Zasa when he senses that Zasa is trying to usurp Michael's power. Michael tries to make peace between the two, but this fails; Zasa calls Vincent a bastard, and Vincent bites his ear. That night, Zasa sends two hitmen to kill Vincent, but Vincent kills them instead after forcing them to reveal who hired them.   

Vincent attempts to ingratiate himself with his uncle by protecting him from rival [[American Mafia|Mafia]] families, who are in league with Zasa and an unknown traitor within Michael's circle. Encouraged by his sister Connie, Michael takes Vincent under his wing and starts mentoring him. Michael admires Vincent's loyalty and intelligence, but also notes that the young man has his father's recklessness and fiery temper.

Vincent saves Michael from an [[assassination]] attempt orchestrated by Zasa at a Mafia summit in [[Atlantic City]]. That same night, Michael is hospitalized following a [[diabetes|diabetic]] [[stroke]]. Believing Zasa will make another attempt on Michael's life, Vincent murders Zasa (with approval from Connie and Corleone assassin [[Al Neri]]). Michael is angry that Vincent used violence to deal with Zasa and did so without Michael's permission.  When Vincent begins a relationship with Michael's daughter [[Mary Corleone|Mary]], Michael fears that his nephew's growing involvement in the family business will endanger her life; he is also concerned about Mary having a relationship with her first cousin. 

When Michael learns that his old friend [[Don Altobello]] is the traitor within the family, Michael has Vincent spy on him. Vincent learns that Licio Lucchesi, a powerful Italian politician and criminal underworld figure, was the mastermind of the assassination plot against his uncle, and employed Altobello, Zasa and corrupt Vatican officials Frederick Keinszig and [[Archbishop Gilday]] to undermine Michael's criminal empire.

Vincent wants permission to retaliate. Michael tacitly agrees, then formally retires as Don and names Vincent his successor. Michael's influence has made Vincent into a new man: wiser, more patient, and understanding his status as the new Don. His first act is to order the murders of Lucchesi, Keinszig, and Gilday. Connie kills Altobello by poisoning him. In return for being made Don, Vincent agrees to end his relationship with Mary. That same night, Altobello's assassin Mosca accidentally kills Mary during an attempt on Michael's life. Enraged, Vincent kills Mosca with a single gunshot.

=== Abandoned sequel ===
What follows in Vincent's story, according to author [[Mario Puzo]] and director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], is not exactly known. However, on ''The Godfather Part III''{{'}}s [[DVD]] commentary,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Coppola explains that both he and Puzo had envisioned a storyline depicting Vincent's reign heading the Corleone family. Vincent, deviating from his predecessors' morals, would have entered the family into the drug trade, driving the Corleone clan back into corruption and eventual decline. Vincent's story ends with him being killed similarly to [[Colombia]]n drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]], and presumably ending the Corleone crime family.

This proposed film would have been titled either ''The Godfather Part IV'' or ''The Godfather: The Final Part''. Flashbacks would include [[Vito Corleone]]'s early days as Don, and the childhood days of Sonny, [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], Michael and Connie Corleone, when they discover exactly the nature of their father's business. The film would have portrayed the early days of [[Tom Hagen]], [[Luca Brasi]] and [[Johnny Fontane]], and Vito's first meeting with [[Hyman Roth]]. According to Coppola, Puzo had composed a rough draft alternating between Vincent's reign as boss and the &quot;Happy Years&quot; of 1926–1939. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Luis Guzmán]], [[Ray Liotta]], and García himself all expressed interest in the film. However, this project has lain dormant since Puzo's death in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''Jim Corrigan''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s that have appeared in numerous [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The first Corrigan initially appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #52 (February 1940), a deceased cop acting as host to the cosmic entity the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Bernard Baily]].

The second Jim Corrigan was an African-American policeman who first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #149, (May 1972). The character was created by John Albano and [[José Delbo]]. He later became a regular supporting character in ''[[Black Lightning]]'' beginning with volume 1 issue #4.

The third Jim Corrigan appeared years later in issue 12 of ''[[Gotham Central]]'', a series about the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. The character, created by [[Greg Rucka]], [[Ed Brubaker]], and [[Michael Lark]] although similar to the first Corrigan in being a cop, is not directly connected to the first. This version is a corrupt, self-serving villain who murders his colleague Crispus Allen; Allen then becomes the host to the Spectre.

[[Image:Morefun52.png|150px|Jim Corrigan's first appearance in ''More Fun Comics'' #52 (February 1940). Cover art by Bernard Baily.|left|thumb]]
Jim Corrigan began his career as the Spectre in the early 1940s, when the hard-boiled police detective was murdered.  Put into cement and thrown into the water by crime-boss Gat Benson, Jim Corrigan's soul left his body and went on to the afterlife.  Instead of going into Heaven, his spirit refused to pass into the afterlife, and his rage was heard by the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], who bonded his spirit to the spirit of God's vengeance, the Spectre. He was condemned to return to Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jerry Siegel]] | Artist = [[Bernard Baily]] | Story = Introduction | Title = [[More Fun Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 52 | Date = February, 1940 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for sixty years of punishing wrongdoings.

As the Spectre, Jim Corrigan returned to the mortal plane as a partial human, where he proceeded to rain his vengeance on Gat Benson and his accomplices.  In the process however, his fiancée, Clarice Winston, was mortally wounded.  Using his newfound power, he was able to return Clarice to life, but later ended their relationship in order to spare her any further pain.  He also broke off with his partner, and became more of a lone agent, trying to distance himself from his mortal ties, although he retained his job on the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jerry Siegel]] | Artist = [[Bernard Baily]] | Story = | Title = [[More Fun Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 53 | Date = March, 1940 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the popularity of superhero comics began to decline in the mid-1940s, the Spectre suffered as a result.  He was reduced to playing the role of &quot;guardian angel&quot; to a bumbling character called &quot;Percival Popp, the Super Cop.&quot; Introduced in #74, December 1941 (aside from a head-shot in a one-panel preview at the end of #73's Spectre story), he was a would-be civilian sleuth who, in his words, latched onto Corrigan &quot;of all the detectives on the force because it appeared to me that you are the most intelligent of the lot! You and I ought to be an unbeatable combination, sir!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = [[Bernard Baily]] | Story = Introducing Percival Popp, the Super Cop | Title = [[More Fun Comics]] | Volume = 1 |Issue = 53 | Date = December, 1941 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = ? | Panel = 7 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following story, the Voice allowed the physical body of Jim Corrigan, still in cement at the bottom of the river, to be resurrected with the Ring of Life, which had helped the Spectre out of some jams in a few previous stories. The Ghostly Guardian found that he could emerge from Corrigan and maintain a separate existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jerry Siegel]] | Artist = [[Bernard Baily]] | Story = Jim Corrigan Lives Again | Title = [[More Fun Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 75 | Date = November, 1941 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | Id = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''More Fun'' #90, April 1943, Jim Corrigan ''per se'' was completely removed from the feature &amp;mdash; he enlisted in the military for World War II service &amp;mdash; and the Spectre's reduction to guardian angel status was complete; he even became invisible to everybody but Percy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = [[Bernard Baily]] | Story = Crime-Buster by Proxy | Title = [[More Fun Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 90 | Date = April 1943 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 2 | Panel = 1-3 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Spectre, Jim Corrigan ran with the JSA, but he was replaced in 1944, and afterwards Jim Corrigan and the Spectre disappeared from the DC Universe for more than twenty years.

====''Spectre'' (vol. 1)====

When the Spectre was revived in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #60, January–February 1966, Jim Corrigan played an important part, as editor [[Julius Schwartz]] and writer [[Gardner Fox]] made significant use of the resurrection of Corrigan's body depicted back in ''More Fun'' #75. While the Ghostly Guardian would be crossing from one mystical plane of existence to another fighting occult menaces, Corrigan, now a captain of Gateway City's police force, was fighting his own battles against a more mundane criminal element. Jim would often get involved in Spectre's conflicts, however. In that first story, another spirit, named Azmodus, took possession of a small-time criminal, and while the two astral beings engaged in cosmic combat, the two mortal men slugged it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner Fox]] | Artist = [[Murphy Anderson]] | Story = War that Shook the Universe | Title = [[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 60 | Date = January–February 1966 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 18-24 | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Showcase'' #64, September–October 1966, when the Spectre took possession of the body of a dying man, Ace Chance, to preserve its spark of life after his soul had departed, that spirit found the living but soulless Corrigan and entered him. With Chance's physical form hospitalized and on life-support, the Spectre found he could not re-enter Jim. Ace had no desire to give up this body, and began romancing heiress Mona Marcy. After Chance was put back into his proper body, Corrigan wondered what he was going to do about Mona, who had no idea who she had really been dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner Fox]] | Artist = [[Murphy Anderson]] | Story = The Ghost of Ace Chance | Title = [[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 64 | Date = September–October 1966 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page =  | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a year later the Spectre was awarded his own comic, and in #2, January–February 1968, Jim asks his astral alter ego for a little privacy, as he has a date with Mona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gardner Fox]] | Artist = [[Neal Adams]] | Story = Die, Spectre--Again! | Title = [[Spectre (comics)#Silver Age version|The Spectre]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 2 | Date = January–February 1968 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 4 | Panel = 6 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While she wouldn't be mentioned again, things would become more involved for Corrigan. This series would establish that prolonged separation from his corporeal body would deplenish the Spectre's energies, and more than once, Jim's will power would be able to keep his spirit form from entering him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Neal Adams]] | Artist = [[Neal Adams]] | Story = The Spectre Means Death? | Title = [[Spectre (comics)#Silver Age version|The Spectre]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 5 | Date = July–August, 1968 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 17 | Panel = 1-4 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Steve Skeates]] | Penciller = [[Jerry Grandenetti]] | Inker = [[Murphy Anderson]] | Story = The Parchment of Power Perilous | Title = [[Spectre (comics)#Silver Age version|The Spectre]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 8 | Date = January–February 1969 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = 8 | Panel = 1-5 | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter instance found Corrigan pinned down by criminals he was after, and his demands for Spectral help result in the tired spirit acting harshly and hurting an innocent man in the vicinity. Shortly after this, the Spectre was chained to The Journal of Judgment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = | Artist = [[Jerry Grandenetti]] | Story = The Spectre | Title = [[Spectre (comics)#Silver Age version|The Spectre]] | Volume 1 | Issue = 9 | Date = March–April 1969 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim made no more appearances in this era.

====Bronze Age====
The next time Jim Corrigan was seen was in the brief but controversial Spectre series in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #s 431&amp;ndash;440, March–April 1974&amp;ndash;July–August 1975. Here, writer [[Michael Fleisher]], ably abetted by atmospheric art from [[Jim Aparo]] ([[Frank Thorne]] and [[Ernie Chan]] spelled him on the pencils once and twice respectively when his schedule became too tight), took the Spectre back to his earliest days. As in the first two years in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'', the hero and his civilian identity were simply two guises of the same entity. Nevertheless, Corrigan's &quot;life&quot; did get interesting. Now a lieutenant in New York City, Jim was investigating the murder of wealthy businessman Adrian Sterling, and met the victim's daughter Gwen. Despite his assertions that romance was out of the question for him, she fell in love with Corrigan. In saving her life from her father's murderer, he had to reveal his true nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Artist = [[Jim Aparo]] | Story = The Anguish of...the Spectre | Title = [[Adventure Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 432 | Date = March–April 1974 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gwen fell under the influence of a [[Mediumship|medium]], and told him about Corrigan's situation, and asked him if he could restore the detective to life. Unfortunately, he was a con artist that the department, and Jim in particular, were investigating, and he took advantage of what he presumed was the woman's mental illness to trap and kill Corrigan. As he was already dead, the plan backfired horribly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Artist = [[Jim Aparo]] | Story = The Swami and...the Spectre |  Title = [[Adventure Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 433 | Date = May–June 1974 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not long later, a reporter named Earl Crawford noticed the number of gruesome finishes that many local criminals had been meeting recently, and suspected a connection. By lying to his editor as to just what he had in mind, he arranged an assignment to ride around with a police criminal investigator, and of all people, Lt. Jim Corrigan was the lucky cop. Crawford soon saw the Spectre in action for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Artist = [[Jim Aparo]] | Story = The Man who Stalked...the Spectre | Title = [[Adventure Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 435 | Date = September–October 1974 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a ghost, Corrigan returned Gwen's feelings and pleaded into the night in his dark apartment for a reprieve. Without telling him, the Voice granted the request, and he awoke the next morning a mortal man. Corrigan did not realize this until he was shot in the line of duty a few hours later. Once out of the hospital, he proposed to Gwen who promptly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Artist = [[Jim Aparo]] | Story = The Voice that Doomed...the Spectre | Title = [[Adventure Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 439 | Date = May–June 1975 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Corrigan was again murdered by criminals, and again sent back to Earth as the Spectre. He appeared to Gwen to give her the news, then took vengeance upon his killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Artist = [[Jim Aparo]] | Story = The Second Death of...the Spectre | Title = [[Adventure Comics]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 440 | Date = July–August 1975 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct follow-up to this run appeared a few years later as a three-issue story arc in the [[Doctor Thirteen|Dr. Thirteen, Ghostbreaker]] series that [[Paul Kupperberg]] was writing in ''[[Ghosts (comics)|Ghosts]]'', #s 97&amp;ndash;99, February&amp;ndash;April 1981. Here, the Spectre was still slaughtering particularly brutal criminals and Earl Crawford was still looking for a way to stop the supernatural entity he knew was responsible, but now Dr. Thirteen was trying to prove he was something normal. Even though Earl and Terry came up with the idea that Lt. Jim Corrigan was somehow connected to the killings, his appearances here were brief and perfunctory.

Another sequel to the ''Adventure'' run was published seven years later. A deluxe format miniseries, ''The Wrath of the Spectre'', reprinted the original ten stories in its first three issues, and in its fourth presented, newly drawn by [[Jim Aparo]] and various inkers, three stories that had been written by [[Michael Fleisher]] in 1975 but left on the proverbial shelf when the series was replaced with [[Aquaman]] (even though Fleisher was already on the record in 1980 as having left just two stories&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Catron]], &quot;The Blessed Life of Michael Fleisher,&quot; ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', #56, June or May, 1980, [[Fantagraphics Books|Fanatagraphics]], p. 51, col. 1 (transcript &quot;edited by Michael Fleisher&quot;, p. 43, col. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;). Here, Earl Crawford is charged with murdering a criminal that was actually eliminated by the Spectre, but found not guilty by reason of insanity, and committed to an asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Penciler = [[Jim Aparo]] | Inker = [[Mike DeCarlo]] | Story = The Arson Fiend and...the Spectre | Title = The Wrath of the Spectre | Volume = 1 |Issue = 4 | Date = August 1988 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Corrigan demonstrates compassion, first by having a disguised Gwen Sterling visit and comfort him, then by using the powers of the Spectre to clear him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Michael Fleisher]] | Penciler = [[Jim Aparo]] | Inker = [[Mike DeCarlo]] | Story = The Maniac and...the Spectre | Title = The Wrath of the Spectre | Volume = 1 | Issue = 4 | Date = August 1988 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Corrigan appeared in each of the Spectre's three ''[[The Brave and the Bold#Volume 1|The Brave and the Bold]]'' team-ups with [[Batman]] during this era, one of which included fighting against the evil sorcerer Wa'arzen (#116, December 1974-January 1975; #180, November 1981; #199, June 1983). One other instance is worth noting: in the revived ''[[All Star Comics]]'', Jim Corrigan, this time an Inspector with the [[Gotham City]] P.D., was seen in #70, January–February 1978.

====''Spectre'' (vol. 2)====
[[Image:SpectreXanadu.jpg|thumb|The Spectre and Madame Xanadu on the cover of ''Spectre'' v2, #2.  Art by [[Michael William Kaluta|Michael Kaluta]].]]
Among the many changes made to DC Comics' characters during the later half of the 1980s (following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), the Spectre (and thereby Jim Corrigan) was largely de-powered.  First, in the conclusion to [[Alan Moore]]'s [[Swamp Thing]] series, &quot;American Gothic&quot;, the Spectre was defeated by evil incarnate as it advances to destroy Heaven.  Finally, the Spectre, in ''Last Days of the Justice Society of America'', failed to resolve the situation and is punished by God for his failure.  Under the authorship of [[Doug Moench]], he became nearly a generic mystical figure, with Corrigan joining an occult detective agency.

This was largely notable because now, Jim Corrigan and the Spectre became two separate entities (although the body of Jim Corrigan was in fact a piece of the Spectre's ectoplasm as later revealed).  The body of Corrigan still served as a host to the Spectre, but the Spectre could move on his own separately for a whole day, afterwards needing to return to Corrigan's body to replenish his energy.  This allowed for Corrigan to actually team up with the Spectre (rather than the two being one), in essence splitting the 'workload' in two, since one could handle research and the other could get the job done.  It also allowed for Corrigan to become a full-fledged detective again.

Nonetheless, if the two were separated for too long, it would spell disaster for both, and therefore [[Madame Xanadu]], who was not only instrumental in returning the Spectre to Earth (and 'separating' Jim Corrigan) but also held her place of operations in the same building as Corrigan's agency, introduced a guardian for Corrigan.  The attractive young woman Kim Liang became not only Jim's secretary, but also a caretaker, herself a separated piece of Xanadu's soul (although this was unknown to her at the time).  The importance of Xanadu in these actions would later set the stage for her role in Corrigan's life when [[John Ostrander]] set up a new Spectre title.

====''Spectre'' (vol. 3)====
Jim Corrigan's status quo was changed when John Ostrander landed the job as writer to a new Spectre ongoing series.  Jim Corrigan and the Spectre were now one once more, and he had moved out of his agency.  Throughout Ostrander's tenure, Jim Corrigan started to come into conflict with the Spectre as he started to grow as a person.  He learned that his old methods no longer applied to the world he lived in, and he was forced to make certain concessions.

Corrigan's transformation begins in the first few issues of the new volume. Corrigan meets Amy Beitermann, a social staff worker and Inspector Nate Kane, a friend of Amy. While investigating the old murder of a woman, Corrigan learns that although he is able to solve her murder, he is unable to understand the victim, whose ghost continues to wander the scene of her death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectre'' (vol. 3) #2 (January 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; When Corrigan exchanges memories with Amy, she learns of his true purpose: &quot;To confront '''and to comprehend''' evil&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectre'' (vol. 3) #4 (March 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; an element newly introduced by Ostrander. Amy serves as Corrigan's spiritual guide from then, until she is murdered by a serial killer in issue #12.

=====#13-26=====
Troubled, Jim Corrigan turns to the church, where he meets Father Richard Craemer (a character introduced by Ostrander in ''[[Suicide Squad]]''), a somewhat unorthodox one at that though, often disagreeing with the church method. After Corrigan's confession, Craemer gives his advice, mentioning Vlatava, a country torn by civil war.

The Spectre razes the country of Vlatava, and he concludes that in order to eradicate evil, he will need to destroy Earth. The [[Phantom Stranger]] gathers a group of mages to stop him, and Madame Xanadu gathers the Israeli sorcerer Ramban (also a character Ostrander used in ''Suicide Squad'') and Craemer.

[[Image:Corrigan4.png|thumb|left|Father Craemer is able to reach out to Jim Corrigan in ''The Spectre'' v3, #18. Art by [[Tom Mandrake]].]]

The group led by the Stranger face an [[Eclipso]]-controlled Spectre while the other group reaches out to Corrigan's soul. Thanks to Craemer, Corrigan is able to reassert control of the Spectre and see the error of his ways. The archangel Michael appears, stating that Corrigan now finally truly can do his work as the Spectre. From then on, Craemer becomes a spiritual advisor to Jim Corrigan.

The Spectre however is deemed a threat to the American government, and with the help of a Professor Hazard is confronted by [[Superman]], who holds the [[Spear of Destiny]], the only weapon known to hurt the Spectre. The Spectre is eventually able to defeat Superman and banish the Spear. Corrigan also learns that unbeknownst to him, he has been keeping his old fiancée Clarice Winston alive with his powers. She is almost killed by her granddaughter Clarissa, and as punishment the Spectre switches their souls.

=====#27-36=====
Azmodus eventually returns and restores Clarissa Winston's (now trapped in her grandmother's body) youth. This body is still connected to the Spectre, and thereby Azmodus can tap into the Spectre's power. The Spectre confronts Azmodus, but is captured as he is shocked to learn that Azmodus is in part, a previous host of the Spectre. His friends, most notably again Father Craemer and the reluctant Nate Kane, are able to free him and beat Azmodus, separating Caraka, previous host to the Spectre from the demon he was bonded with. In order to defeat Azmodus however, the Spectre required to cut his lifeline to Clarice's body, he decides to switch again with her repentant granddaughter. As Clarice goes to Heaven, it is revealed that she was in fact, Caraka's soulmate all along, and was attracted to Jim because of their similarities. After this ordeal, Jim Corrigan continues to serve as the Spectre, now once more a step closer to his redemption, with Craemer as his advisor.

In order to find his connection to humanity again, Jim Corrigan gets himself assigned as Nate Kane's partner, the two becoming a police duo. Eventually the Spectre is seduced by the demon [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] and Jim is allowed to go into Heaven, now separated from the Spectre, but he refuses. He retakes control of the Spectre although he learns that he wasn't as in control as he thought.

=====#37-50=====
Nate Kane is shot, and the two become involved in a plot concerning a mystical talisman that represents the iconic America. Near the end of that quest for the various broken pieces of the talisman, Nate Kane and Jim Corrigan are once again forced to grow closer after Jim has to enter Nate's body in order to heal himself after a short side-adventure in which he had to use his Spectre powers to keep the Earth alive during ''[[The Final Night]]''.

During the course of the search for the talisman, Jim also come to new insights as he not only meets the spirit of his old childhood friend Lonetree, but is also confronted with the fact that he was a man of the 1930s. As a hardboiled no-nonsense cop in the 1930s, Corrigan was a different man faced with different situations.

Corrigan was finally able to see the current American world, including its segregation of the [[African American]]s, the abuse of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], but also the subjugation of women (and the connected [[witch-hunt]]s) and other parts of America's past.

Ultimately, with the help of his friends, and various spirits that represent the spirit of America today, a new American talisman is created, and Jim Corrigan also finds himself starting to change into a different man, and what he believes to be a better man.

=====#51-62=====
As Nate Kane and Jim Corrigan share the body of Kane, Nate comes to experience certain memories of Corrigan's revolving around a murder case from the 1930s. Intrigued, Nate Kane investigates further, and he comes upon facts that indicated that Jim Corrigan might have been a murderer before his involvement with the Spectre. Meanwhile, the Spectre grows more savage, among other things killing all of the guilty on death row in a New York jail. Craemer continues to try and guide him. Corrigan also learns of what Nate is doing and the two part ways. To atone for his murdering of the criminals in the New York jail, Corrigan helps to prove the innocence of the one man he did not kill, but loses control once more, killing a bunch of corrupt police officers. During this time, he also comes across the troubled [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Michael Holt]], whom he influences to become the second [[Mister Terrific (comics)|Mr. Terrific]].

The Spectre continues his merciless way, dispensing justice on every guilty person that he comes across. He also finally meets Nate Kane, and meets the woman he previously thought he had murdered. Trying to come to grips with his own sins as well as hers (she had killed her mother and tried to frame Corrigan for it), the woman's granddaughter mercy killed her grandmother in fear of what the Spectre would do. Forced to judge her, Corrigan and the Spectre fight and decide that they will need the judgement of God on their own existence.

To their surprise, God has gone missing, as has Heaven. The two decide to work together and they visit various pantheons, as well as entering the Source Wall. Given only two cryptic messages, the Spectre demands to confront God. He is bombarded with the nature of God and becomes one with every particle in the universe. The experience again conflicts the Spectre and Corrigan, and pushed to the brink, they are ejected from the Source Wall. They then learn that the gap between the two has grown so wide that they can separate themselves. At the advice of Father Craemer, the two travel inside themselves and are eventually confronted by a seemingly crazy God who resembles Corrigan's father.

[[Image:Corrigan.png|thumb|left|200px|Jim Corrigan relinquishes the Spectre. Art by [[Tom Mandrake]].]]
God assumed the form of Corrigan's father, a travelling preacher, because he was the most influential person during Jim Corrigan's youth. Jim's father tried to imprint his black and white view of good and evil on the young boy (usually through both verbal and physical abuse), even though he himself often gave into sin. Eventually the ruse is uncovered and it turns out that Jim has finally undergone his final test and is ready to leave the mantle of the Spectre.

With the help of the Spectre, Jim Corrigan's old (dead) body is given a proper burial, and his funeral is attended by many heroes and friends. Then Jim Corrigan relinquishes the Spectre, and as Father Craemer bids his last respects to his friend, from the heavens, a message is carved upon the formerly blank gravestone of Jim Corrigan, stating: &quot;James Corrigan, servant of God&quot;.
{{Clear}}

====''Day of Judgment''====
{{main|Day of Judgment (comics)}}
Although Corrigan was laid to rest, the power of the Spectre was still in the world.  During the mini-series ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'', the Spectre is controlled by the [[fallen angel]] Asmodel, who uses the Spectre's awesome might to freeze Hell and unleash hordes of demons upon the world.

In an effort to stop the Spectre, the heroes divide into groups, of which one is sent to collect the soul of Jim Corrigan, so that he can reclaim the Spectre mantle.  Amongst his old friends of the JSA and his love Amy in Heaven, Corrigan refuses to leave the afterlife to rejoin with the Spectre, stating that he is finally at peace and that his time in Heaven has sapped his will to the point that he would no longer be able to control the Spectre anyway. The heroes decide to respect Jim's wishes, and they eventually recruited the soul of [[Hal Jordan]] from Purgatory to assume the mantle of the Spectre, the Spectre accepting Hal when he declares that he deserves to be punished for his actions in life.

During the recent resurrection of the [[Spirit King]]- due to Hal's attempts to turn the Spectre's role to one of redemption having weakened the Spectre's hold on the spirits that he had damned in the past-, Father Craemer appeared to try and advise Hal Jordan on how to regain control of the spirit, saying that Jim Corrigan had sent him to help,&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' Vol.1 #61&lt;/ref&gt; but it was left unclear if he had actually been contacted by Jim Corrigan or if he simply meant that his experience with Jim had helped him recognise what was happening and inspired him to help for the sake of his friend.

====The New 52====
In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Jim Corrigan is a [[Gotham City]] [[Detective|Police Detective]] whose fiance was kidnapped. He is guided by the [[Phantom Stranger]] on the instructions of '''[[God|The Voice]]'''. He leads Jim Corrigan to the abandoned warehouse where she's been kept, but this turns out to be a trap. Jim Corrigan and his girlfriend are killed by the kidnappers and he is then transformed into '''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]''' who accuses the Phantom Stranger of betraying him. As The Spectre is about to attack the Phantom Stranger, The Voice intervenes and sends Spectre off to inflict his wrath on those who are more deserving of Spectre's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;''Phantom Stranger'' (vol. 4) #0 (November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is revealed The Voice chose him like he did the Stranger to be &quot;the mirror of his desire for justice&quot; (though Corrigan believes in vengeance) and imbued him with divine powers. Jim returns to work as a police detective in [[Gotham City]] and the rage filled Jim was performing his duties as The Spectre by practicing vengeance rather than Justice until [[Phantom Stranger]] attacked his police precinct convinced he was the one who kidnapped his family out of revenge. After exchanging blows physically and verbally until &quot;The Voice&quot; (God) himself intervened in the form of a [[Scottish Terrier]] (his sense of humor) and informed the Stranger of his mistake and set him on the right path, &quot;The Voice&quot; also set Corrigan straight on his duties and that he is meant to exact justice and not wrath.

===Fictional character biography===
An [[African-American]] police officer based in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] who worked with both [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Black Lightning]]. He first appeared in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #149, (May 1972). He later became a regular supporting character in ''Black Lightning'' beginning with volume 1 issue #4.

==Jim Corrigan (2000s)==

===Fictional character biography===
A Crime Scene Unit officer in the [[Gotham City Police Department]], Jim Corrigan is, like so many of that city's police force, corrupt.  He routinely abuses his position by selling crime scene memorabilia, such as bullets as well as more extravagant items lost by the city's colourful villains.

Although the [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] division was aware of his activities, they could not interfere due to an explosive encounter between Corrigan and [[Renee Montoya]], of the Major Crimes Unit, when [[Crispus Allen]] had been accused of murder.

Allen, who loathed the fact that Corrigan had gotten off due to Montoya's desire to protect him, had begun investigating Corrigan.  Just as his investigation began to bear fruit however, Corrigan shot and killed Detective Allen.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham Central'' #38 (February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

This spurred the GCPD to arrest Corrigan, but unfortunately the past incident with Montoya along with a decent alibi had given Corrigan the defense he needed to avoid court and jail.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham Central'' #39 (March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gc40&gt;''Gotham Central'' #40 (April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Montoya, who was blind with fury and had been slowly falling into a deep depression over the past few months, had finally snapped with the loss of Allen.  She stormed into Corrigan's apartment and after knocking out his girlfriend, threatened to kill Corrigan.  The previously smug CSI officer broke down and tearfully began pleading for Montoya to spare his life.  Despite her thirst for vengeance, Montoya let him go and then resigned from the force.&lt;ref name=gc40 /&gt;

In the final issue of the three-issue miniseries ''Crisis Aftermath: The Spectre'', a miniseries about Crispus Allen dealing with his new role as the Spectre, it was revealed that Corrigan had spent the time after Montoya's attack, drinking (Allen found him in this way but did not take vengeance &amp;mdash; too easy and too personal), but one night upon stumbling into an alley he was confronted by Allen's young son Mal and shot multiple times, killing him. Later stories instead identify Corrigan's killer as Mal's brother, Jacob Allen.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Revelations''  #1 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===''Kingdom Come''===
In the four-issue ''[[Elseworlds]]'' miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', The Spectre is just Jim Corrigan a once human soul imbued with angelic powers by [[God]]. In a near apocalyptic world the Spectre takes a preacher named [[Norman McCay]] through the events of a possible future of the DC Universe. Here, Spectre is to determine who is responsible for an impending [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] event. However, here his &quot;faculties are not what they once were&quot;, and he is said to need an outside perspective to properly judge the events they witness.

A conversation between McCay and [[Deadman]] reveals that, with the passing of time, Corrigan has become further and further removed from humanity now only wearing his cloak to cover an otherwise nude body (Similar to [[Doctor Manhattan]]). He is reminded by McCay of his humanity to see things through the perspective as the man he once was and decides nobody is to blame. Corrigan becomes a member of McCay's congregation and they become friends.

In the epilogue set in a superhero-themed restaurant, he expresses irritation that the meal named after him, &quot;Spectre platter&quot;, is a mix of [[spinach]] and [[cottage cheese]].

'''Ana Lucia Cortez''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', played by [[Michelle Rodriguez]]. Ana Lucia made her first appearance as a guest star in the [[Exodus (Lost)|first season finale]], and became part of the main cast for [[Lost (season 2)|season two]]. After Oceanic Flight 815 splits in mid-air, the tail section and fuselage crash on opposite sides of a mysterious island. Ana Lucia becomes the leader of the tail section. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] in her two centric episodes, &quot;[[Collision (Lost)|Collision]]&quot; and &quot;[[Two for the Road (Lost)|Two for the Road]]&quot;, show her life as a police officer before the crash.

Rodriguez provoked controversy after being stopped by the police for [[driving under the influence]] a few weeks before her character was killed, leading to speculation that this was the reason for her death. The producers of ''Lost'' stated that Rodriguez was only interested in appearing for one season, so Ana Lucia's death was written in from the beginning. She is shot and killed by [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]].

'''Fabian Cortez''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicated as an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/illustrator [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' #1 (October 1991).

==Fictional character biography==

===Acolytes===
Thought to be royalty from [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, Fabian Cortez organizes the original [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who pledge themselves to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his cause. Cortez then goads and manipulates Magneto into combat with humanity and the [[X-Men]] at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto’s space-station, [[Asteroid M]], and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez’s own sister [[Anne-Marie Cortez|Anne Marie]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortez recruits a group of Acolytes who, believing Magneto to be dead and martyred for his cause, now worship him as their god, to follow Cortez in Magneto’s name.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men 300&lt;/ref&gt; They launch several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] are being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital,.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' (vol 1) #92&lt;/ref&gt; Magneto eventually resurfaces, sending his chosen heir [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] to inform the Acolytes of Cortez’s betrayal. The Acolytes welcome Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez is left behind.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #304&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bloodties''===
Fearing Magneto’s wrath, Cortez flees to [[Genosha]]. Still claiming to speak in Magneto’s name, he incites the nation’s mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world’s first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnaps Magneto’s granddaughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Cortez is unaware that Magneto had recently been [[mindwipe]]d by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and Exodus comes to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Vol. 1'' #369&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back with the Acolytes===
Cortez reappears months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulates [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] into posing as Magneto,&lt;ref&gt;''Magneto'' #1 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme’s failure, he is allowed to return to the team. Months later, at a time when Exodus had briefly been imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez leads one group, but they abandon him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he has been using them for his own purposes.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Dark Seduction===
Alone again, Cortez is surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, whom [[United Nations]] has given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Fabian Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto only lets Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his powers have been reduced and Cortez’s mutant power is to heighten the abilities of other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto's UN advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto is restored to full power by one of the Genengineer’s machines and as he no longer needs Cortez, pulls him from a prison in Hammer Bay, Genosha fifty miles to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact kills Cortez instantly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Magneto: Dark Seduction&quot; #1-4 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Necrosha ===
After the X-Men form [[Utopia]], Magneto joins them, saying he supports their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #516&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] especially wants Magneto captured for his collaboration with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She has three of her recently resurrected mind-controlled soldiers—Acolytes Cortez, [[Marco Delgado (comics)|Delgado]], and [[Seamus Mellencamp|Mellencamp]]—hunt down Magneto. They try to torture [[Loa (comics)|Loa]] to get the information out of her, but when she tries to hide in her room she finds [[Deadpool]] inside it. Deadpool battles the trio, but the techno-organic virus that is inside the Acolytes (which caused their resurrection) prevent him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabs Loa by the throat and demands to know Magneto's location, saying that even though Selene wants Magneto alive he will fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begs Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez does not believe possible. Deadpool knocks Loa out of Cortez's hands, but then is overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa uses her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, killing him. Deadpool, seeing that Loa's powers were able to slay Selene's minions, forces her to kill Cortez and Delgado too by throwing her into them (to survive, she has to slide through them, which causes them to crumble). Deadpool then tells [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] that he should not be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Cortez possesses the ability to enhance a mutant’s abilities to occasionally dangerous limits and dance beyond their control (temporarily powering them up at the expense of burning out their bodies). In X-Men #1 (1991), while onboard Asteroid M, Magneto returned from a fight with the X-Men having suffered deep lacerations to his lower abdomen from Wolverine's claws. Cortez &quot;healed&quot; Magneto (as he said he had also done with his sister after an earlier battle) and temporarily brought him back to full health. This turned out to be &quot;fake&quot; healing in that Magneto needed to regularly be &quot;healed&quot; by Cortez to stay uninjured. Whether this was an offshoot of his main powers or that he was boosting their own natural healing abilities is not known. This ability was not used much or at all in his later history. 

He is highly intelligent and an able military strategist. Cortez is also a skilled martial artist, and often carries a firearm.

==Other versions==

===''Marvel Zombies''===
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' reality, Magneto heads to earth to rescue anyone he can from the zombie plague. Fabian is entrusted with overseeing [[Asteroid M]] and preparing it for the last outpost of humanoid life.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot; one-shot (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Cortez does this well; his group soon joins up with other survivors, including [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Magneto perishes in battle against the zombies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; #1-5 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, in [[Marvel Zombies 2]], Fabian's child regains control of the colony during a battle with cosmically powered zombies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marvel Zombies 2&quot; #1–5 (October 2007&amp;nbsp;– February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''X-Men Forever''===
{{main|X-Men Forever}}
It is later revealed that shortly after the X-Men escape the destruction of Asteroid M, Nick Fury enlists the X-Men in helping him find and capture Fabian Cortez. The X-Men successfully capture Cortez, though he nearly defeats them single-handedly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;X-Men: Forever&quot; #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Fabian Cortez first appears in the two-part ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode “Sanctuary” voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. As in the comics storyline, Cortez is the leader of the Acolytes and uses his powers to bolster Magneto's own abilities. However, Cortez's extreme anti-human sentiments lead him to betray Magneto and try to kill him, framing [[Professor X]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; he captures and tortures the latter. Cortez threatens to destroy Earth but is stopped by the X-Men and [[Amelia Voght]], who reveals Cortez's betrayal to the other Acolytes and the entire mutant population of Asteroid M. He is trapped in Asteroid M by a vengeful Magneto, but is rescued from its destruction by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and [[Deathbird]]. Apocalypse grants him the ability of altering the mutations of other mutants. Cortez then appears in the final-season episode &quot;The Fifth Horseman&quot;, now turned into a servant and worshipper of his savior. Cortez assembles a cult worshipping Apocalypse as well as the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse (who was defeated and left bodyless in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;). Cortez captures [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and turns Beast into a feral monster but is stopped by [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] (who was one of the Hounds). After being defeated, Cortez begs Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure. However, Apocalypse is not angry, stating that Cortez has succeeded in providing him with a new vessel. When Cortez asks what he means, Apocalypse takes possession of Cortez's body.

===Video games===
* Fabian Cortez is a boss in ''[[X-Men 2: Game Master's Legacy]]''. Defeating him releases [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].
* Cortez also appears in ''[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]'' for [[Sega Genesis]] as a boss during stage 3, before Magneto is recruited as a playable character. He flies around on a jetpack through the level, finally busting through the window at the end of the stage.

'''Nicholas Charles &quot;Nick&quot; Cotton''' is a [[fictional character]] from the British [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' played by [[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]] on a recurring basis from the soap's debut episode in February 1985, in several separate stints, a regular in 1985 then a recurring character from 1986 to 1989, a regular in 1990 and 1991 with guest appearances in 1993 and 1998 and as a regular from 2000 to 2001, 2008 to 2009 and from 2014 until the character's demise in 2015. Nick is the son of characters [[Charlie Cotton|Charlie]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) and [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]), and the father of [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), [[Ashley Cotton|Ashley]] (Rossi Higgins/[[Frankie Fitzgerald]]) and [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]) (all three of whom were initially kept secret from his mother). His storylines have seen him commit the murders of Reg Cox in 1985 and Eddie Royle in 1991, succumb to a heroin addiction, his racism, his attempts to poison his own mother, conspiring to fake his own death and unintentionally causing the deaths of his son Ashley in 2001 and former police officer [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) in 2015. On 29 July 2014, it was confirmed that Altman would return and Nick appeared on-screen again on 24 October 2014.

Nick has also embarked on numerous feuds with the likes of [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]), [[Mark Fowler]] ([[David Scarboro]]/[[Todd Carty]]), [[Ali Osman]] ([[Nej Adamson|Nejdet Salih]]), [[Pete Beale]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]), [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), [[Tony Carpenter]] ([[Oscar James]]) and [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]).

In January 2015 it was revealed that Nick would be leaving as part of ''EastEnders'' anniversary celebrations in February 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/eastenders-spoilers-dot-branning-accused-4956549|title=EastEnders spoilers Dot Branning to be accused of killing her OWN SON Nick Cotton|last=Boyle|first=Simon|author2=Pauley, Nigel |date=10 January 2015|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He departed on 19 February 2015, 30 years after his initial appearance, with the character's death mirroring that of Nick's first victim, Reg Cox.

==Creation==
Nick Cotton was the twenty-fourth character invented by the creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]]. Nick was not part of Holland's and Smith's original vision for ''EastEnders'', and his creation came about as an afterthought. The first episode of the series was to include the death of an elderly resident, [[Reg Cox]], who had been brutally attacked in his home, and left to die. During the first writers' meeting, where the writers were introduced to the intended characters and early scripts, each independently wanted to know which character had killed Reg. However, Holland and Smith had never intended for the murderer to be unveiled. They had no idea who had killed Reg Cox, and they had felt that &quot;the who&quot; was not important. The fact that he was dead following an attack was the important issue, and Reg's murder was not intended to be solved, it was only there to tell the audience, from the outset, that [[Walford]] was a rough and tough place. The writers opposed this. They accused Holland of throwing away a great opportunity and suggested that a murder hunt would provide an array of dramatic possibilities that would captivate the audience. After deciding that all of the twenty-three original characters were incapable of committing the crime, Holland decided to invent an entirely new character, in the form of Nick Cotton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Story&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original character outline for Nick read: &quot;His image is exclusively macho. Vanishes for weeks on end. Mum doesn't ask questions... Unlike [[Den Watts|Den]], Nick is a real crook. Worms his way into people's confidentiality and homes. From then on, lives on his wits. Waiting for the moment to strike; to nick the cash and disappear...Usually chooses his victims who, for one reason or another, are frightened to report him...Nick's a heroin addict.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Story 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Holland|1987|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Nick was only intended to be a semi-regular character, Julia Smith was not involved in his casting and the actor [[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]] was chosen by the directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Story 2&quot;/&gt; However she requested he was axed, after he refused to portray Nick having a gay relationship with [[Lofty Holloway]] ([[Tom Watt (actor)|Tom Watt]]) because he thought it was out of character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/dec/10/how-we-made-eastenders?INTCMP=SRCH|title=How we made: June Brown and John Altman on EastEnders|last=Tims|first=Interviews by Anna|date=2012-12-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and storylines==
Nick has been described by ''EastEnders''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; executive producer Diederick Santer as &quot;the show's premier villain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=EastEnders Revealed: Nick Cotton Returns|series=EastEnders Revealed|serieslink=EastEnders Revealed|credits=Richard Mears (director, producer), Mark Cossey (executive producer)|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC1]]|airdate=2008-12-30|number=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]'' documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who &quot;thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Co-star [[Charlie Clements]] ([[Bradley Branning]]) has stated: &quot;You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; while [[Leslie Grantham]] ([[Den Watts]]) opined that &quot;There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; This assessment is shared by series story producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]], who has explained: &quot;It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Santer has discussed the &quot;wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship&quot; Nick shares with his mother, [[Dot Cotton]], and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Santer explained: &quot;There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Grantham has stated that Dot is the &quot;one friend in [Nick's] life&quot;, while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: &quot;Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: &quot;No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably [[Al Capone]]'s mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Nick Cotton (1985).jpg|left|thumb|170px|Nick Cotton as he appeared in 1985]]
The debut episode of ''EastEnders'' began with the discovery of elderly resident [[Reg Cox]]'s dead body, following his murder by Nick. Holland and Smith wanted to introduce the series in a dramatic fashion, and believed the Reg Cox storyline to be a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brake|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santer has explained that Nick was established as a &quot;kind of spitting, snarling beast right from the outset&quot;, with the end of the first episode seeing Nick granted ''EastEnders''' first [[drum roll]] ending as he punched through the glass door window of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; After a few weeks of the police investigation, prime suspect Nick left the Square, and in April it was reported that he had been arrested. After Nick's mother, Dot, was introduced to the cast in July, she informed the audience that Nick had managed to get off on probation, and later in the year, he returned to [[Albert Square]]. The mystery of Reg's murder was not finally solved until 1988 when Nick confessed to Den Watts in [[Dickens Hill]] prison that he had been responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Although Nick is only a semi-regular character, his intermittent appearances were always scripted to make a big impact on the show, as well as all the characters involved in his storylines. He reappeared and left several times during the first few years of the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character &quot;Nasty Nick&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside Story&quot;/&gt; Altman has commented: &quot;I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people just love to hate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of [[Walford]], with Altman explaining: &quot;Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody puts down the shutters and locks up the bar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, &quot;nasty&quot; image, with ''EastEnders'' series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; &quot;When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a [[Dickensian]] baddy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; [[Frankie Fitzgerald]], who played Nick's son [[Ashley Cotton]] from 2000 to 2001, agreed: &quot;The look of Nasty Nick, you know, he was a bad guy. Even when he gets dressed up in a suit, he's still got the earring, he's still got the rings, he's still got the tattoo on his neck.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt;

One of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. ''EastEnders'' writer Sarah Phelps explained: &quot;For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his newfound faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast composed of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father [[Charlie Cotton|Charlie]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), Dot's close friend [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) and Alistair, the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the &quot;one time we saw a glimmer of Nick's good side&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

He was not away from Walford for long. In 1991, he returned to ''EastEnders'' with a heroin addiction but his mother was still determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: &quot;I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met with a guy who was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go [[cold turkey]]. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, [[The Queen Victoria]] landlord [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. Written by [[Tony McHale]], it finished with a cliffhanger featuring [[Clyde Tavernier]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]) in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife. Originally the plan had been for the audience to know from the outset that Nick was responsible, but this was changed to exploit the [[whodunnit]] angle, which over the years has been a popular nature of storyline in EastEnders.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; A witness eventually came forward implicating Nick and he stood trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by [[Tony Jordan]]. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in January 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Altman summarised: &quot;Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt;

Nick was written out of the show along with Dot when [[June Brown]] (who plays Dot) decided to depart from the series in August 1993. Their departing storyline saw Nick introduce Dot to his wife, [[Zoe Cotton|Zoe]], and young son [[Ashley Cotton|Ashley]]. Dot was initially unconvinced that Zoe was truly Nick's wife, as several years before, he had pretended to have a pregnant girlfriend in an attempt to con money out of her. Once Dot was convinced Nick was being truthful, however, she quickly grew close to Ashley, and the family moved to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] together. This would be the last time Dot and Nick would be onscreen for several years. In 1997, June Brown was persuaded to reprise her role as Dot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61125206.html|title=DOT SQUARES UP TO A NEW START|date=28 April 1997|work=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her return, Dot explained that Nick had been arrested yet again off-screen for drugs possession, and that Zoe and Ashley had moved away, tired of his criminal acts. 
[[File:Mark&amp;NickCotton.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mark got his revenge on Nick]]

John Altman reprised his role as Nick after a five-year absence in March 1998, having escaped from prison and on the run. He ran into Dot's close friend [[Nigel Bates]] who told him to stay away. He returned a few weeks later after Dot discovered him hiding in her house. He tried to cheat Dot out of her money again by telling her he is dying of [[AIDS]] caused by his drug addiction, and that he needed money for his medication. Dot believed him and tried to arrange money for Nick but soon discovered he had been lying about his illness all along, and had him rearrested and sent back to prison.

In October 2000, a special 'soap-bubble' titled ''The Return of Nick Cotton'' aired. The episode centred around Nick's release from prison, his reconciliation with his son, and even featured [[Christopher Hancock]] who played Nick's father Charlie, making a brief cameo appearance as a ghost almost a decade after his character was killed off. The episode paved the way for Nick's subsequent return to Walford, where he reignited an old feud with [[Mark Fowler]] and had a spell in a wheelchair as a result of a fall from the viaduct before departing to a spinal unit in February 2001.

After three months away, he returned in May 2001; he was able to walk, but still needed crutches. This comeback was going to be even shorter than his previous one, and following by a much longer absence from the show. Determined to continue the feud with Mark Fowler, he indirectly caused the death of his son, Ashley, after sabotaging Mark's motorbike, only for Ashley to steal and crash it. Following Ashley's death, Dot threw Nick out and told him never to return, as she would never be able to forgive him. She had overheard an argument between Nick and Mark just after the crash, and realised that Nick had tampered with the brakes on Mark's motorbike, which Ashley had then stolen and crashed. She waited until after the funeral before confronting Nick at home.

However, Santer explains: &quot;There will always be a way back to Dot for Nick&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; a position supported by ''EastEnders'' writer James Payne, who states: &quot;[Dot] believes, I think, deep down, that he has the potential for change, that he can be a good boy. I think that she’ll keep wishing that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; The first steps towards reconciliation were made in 2006, when Nick developed cancer off-screen, and Dot visited him in prison.

On 2 October 2008 it was reported that Nick would return to ''EastEnders'' on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an &quot;''EastEnders'' legend&quot; and &quot;one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;back&quot; /&gt; Altman stated: &quot;After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to [[Albert Square]].

He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: &quot;Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt;

Although suspicious to begin with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick really was a reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: &quot;Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;revealed&quot; /&gt; As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', &quot;[Dot's] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine.

Phil gave Billy the opportunity to kill Nick and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started due to a fight between Nick and [[Ryan Malloy]], who was one of the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a156857/the-cafe-explodes.html|title=The café explodes|first=Kris|last=Green|publisher=[[Digital Spy]] | accessdate = 27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in an explosion at the café with Nick inside.

In March 2014, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son [[Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), although it is later revealed that he is [[police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]]. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother [[Yvonne Cotton|Yvonne]] ([[Pauline McLynn]]) back in the 1980s. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker [[Les Coker]] prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, [[Carol Jackson]] asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.

In October 2014, Nick re-appears in Albert Square, seven months after his faked death. Charlie's fiancè [[Ronnie Mitchell]] takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Having overheard Ronnie and Phil talking about killing him to get rid of him once and for all, Nick decides to cut the brakes on Ronnie's car. After the wedding, Charlie, Ronnie and [[Roxy Mitchell]] are involved in an accident which hits and later kills [[Emma Summerhayes]], while Ronnie is left in a coma. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car but he convinces her to frame Phil by planting the oil rag in his coat pocket. Yvonne tells Charlie what Nick has done but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident, so Charlie asks them both to leave. Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick. [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) finds out and urges her to stop, so when she sees Nick, she urges him to confess to the police about framing Phil for Ronnie's sake, but he says he does not care about Ronnie, so Dot slaps him and leaves, telling him she hopes he rots. Later, she finds him unconscious, Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that [[List of EastEnders characters (1985)#Reg Cox|Reg Cox]] was discovered 30 years prior. Dot confesses to letting Nick die to Charlie who plans to get rid of Nick's body with Les Coker's help to save Dot from going to prison.

In the live episode aired on 19 February to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the show, the very first scene from the show's first episode was recreated. [[Stacey Slater]], [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] and [[Kush Kazemi]] find Nick's body in the same way [[Den Watts]], [[Arthur Fowler]] and [[Ali Osman]] found Reg Cox 30 years earlier. Dot confesses to killing Nick and is taken away by police. His body is removed from the house the following day. Three months later, Dot receives 14 months in prison for Nick's manslaughter, but she is later released after four months.

==Reception==
Nick Cotton has become one of ''EastEnders''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; most renowned villains. His 'nastiness' was voted the 25th &quot;Greatest Soap Moment&quot; in a [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] poll in 2004, and he has also been voted the 4th most villainous television character in a [[Channel 4]] poll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polls&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927210435/http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/tvpolls.html Television polls]&quot;, ''Custard.tv''. URL last accessed on 2006-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist [[Charlie Brooker]] has denied Nick's villainous characterisation however, writing: &quot;The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] catalogue. Whereas [''[[Coronation Street]]'' villain] [[Jez Quigley]] looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, wondering when he last washed his hair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/nov/22/tvandradio.television1|title=No pain, no gain|last=Brooker|first=Charlie|date=22 November 2000|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=2008-12-31|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Fiona McCade satirised the character when Altman appeared on the children's TV show ''[[Balamory]]'', advising parents to: &quot;be prepared to cover your little ones’ eyes as the bad boy of soap strides into the colourful, fictional paradise, no doubt goosing Miss Hoolie, upsetting [[PC Plum]] and making Josie jump.

The '''Crime Doctor''' is the name of two [[fictional]] [[supervillain]]s that appears in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The Crime Doctor is a medical expert who caters exclusively to criminals, originally an enemy of [[Batman]].

==Publication History==
The first Crime Doctor first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #77 (July 1943), and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Matthew Thorne===
The Crime Doctor is surgeon '''Matthew Thorne''' &amp;ndash; originally named &quot;Bradford Thorne&quot;. In [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], it has been revealed he is the brother of the [[Gotham City]] gangster [[Rupert Thorne]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} 

Thorne started out as a rogue physician in [[Gotham City]], setting up an illegal clinic and treating criminals for money. He was stopped and apprehended time and again by the [[Batman]]. 

For a while, it seemed that Thorne's mind had been destroyed due to mercury poisoning at the hands of the [[Sterling Silversmith]], but Thorne later returned to his criminal career, his mind seemingly intact. The Crime Doctor usually never took part in physical battles against [[superheroes]], but he was recruited by [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] into their [[supervillain]] army during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

Initially, the Crime Doctor took his career as a doctor very seriously, and would not commit crimes that conflicted with his [[Hippocratic Oath]]. In later appearances however, he seemed to abandon this principle.

The Crime Doctor's recent appearances have all depicted him wearing star-shaped glasses. It was later revealed that those glasses were a trophy taken from his first victim, a young nurse named Katherine Wheyhall, who had suspected his [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] inclination to murder and [[torture]] while witnessing him deliberately botching a surgery.

Later, the Crime Doctor paid a visit to the nurse and killed her, thus setting the basis of his newfound criminal career.

The Crime Doctor appears in ''[[Villains United]]'' (2006), where he tortures the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] for the identity of [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]]. This fails in the case of the 'Parademon', who equates torture with love. Breaking his restraints, [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] knocks him out with a metal tray table (where the Doctor had his medical equipment).&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|story=Privileged to Spill Her Blood|title=[[Villains United]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=September 2005|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the &quot;Progeny&quot; arc of ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]'', the Crime Doctor tries to 'defect' from the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. The Society sends [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] to repay the Crime Doctor by torturing and killing his daughter as he had done to his victims. After a gruesome battle, the Birds of Prey almost manage to subdue Prometheus, but the Crime Doctor decides to kill himself, thus ensuring his own punishment, and sparing his daughter, who, alone and outcast by the other children, subsequently falls prey to the ambition of [[Lady Shiva]] to have a young apprentice to mold in her image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|writer=[[Gail Simone|Simone, Gail]]|penciller=[[Paulo Siqueira|Siqueira, Paulo]]|copencillers=[[Joe Prado|Prado, Joe]]|inker=[[Robin Riggs|Riggs, Robin]]|coinkers=[[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]||story=Progeny|title=[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]|volume=1|issue=92-95|date=May-August 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

===Anica Balcescu===
A new, female Crime Doctor appeared in ''[[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]'' vol. 4 #32 (2008), a Romanian widow and survivor of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime named '''Anica Balcescu'''.

Following the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Anica Balcescu was seen as a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as she grafted Wonder Woman's lasso to [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]].

==Powers and abilities==
The original Crime Doctor had no super human powers. However, he was a skilled physician and an expert torturer. He sometimes carried an injector gun which could gas opponents to sleep. He also sometimes used a [[scalpel]] to assault his opponents.

==In other media==
The Crime Doctor appears in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode &quot;Paging The Crime Doctor&quot; voiced by [[Joseph Campanella]]. This version is made into a sympathetic character. In this portrayal, Matthew Thorne's brother Rupert pushed him into the role. He attended medical school with [[Thomas Wayne]] and [[Leslie Thompkins]], the three becoming close friends. Matthew later lost his [[medical license]] after failing to file a report about his brother's gunshot wound to his superiors. With his license gone, he now worked as &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot; for Rupert and his men in hopes that Rupert would one day use his influence in [[Gotham City]] to get Matthew his license back. In the episode, Rupert needed surgery and since he was paranoid that his enemies were going to attack him during his moment of &quot;weakness,&quot; he asked Matthew to perform the surgery. Needing an assistant, Rupert had his men abduct Dr. Leslie Thompkins. Rupert Thorne wanted to have Thompkins killed after the surgery to prevent her from telling anything to the police, but Matthew ultimately went against his brother's orders and helped Leslie to escape from Rupert and both were aided by Batman. Afterwards, Matthew turned himself over to the police. He was later visited by Bruce Wayne who paid his bail. Although Matthew thought Bruce would try to exploit him like Rupert had, Matthew found that Bruce only wanted him to tell him about his father and gladly obliged.

He is also referenced  in &quot;[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]&quot;. A lab coat within an office in Elliot Memorial Hospital bears an ID badge with his name and face hanging from the breast pocket.

'''Crossfire''' ('''William Cross''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Crossfire is the cousin of [[Darren Cross]] and the second cousin of [[Augustine Cross]].

==Publication history==
Crossfire's first appearance was in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #52 (1979) and was created by writer [[Steven Grant]] and artist Jim Craig. His next appearance in ''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' Vol. 1 #4 (1983) was the first of many encounters with the title character.

The character was one of the central villains in ''[[Spider-Man]]: Breakout'' #1-5 (2005). Flashback scenes revealed elements of Crossfire’s life before his supervillain exploits. He also went on to appear as a central character in the limited series ''Villains for Hire'' #1-4 (2011-2012), a supervillain spin-off of Marvel's [[Heroes for Hire]] series.

Crossfire has made minor appearances in ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #6 (2002), ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #3-5 (2004) and ''[[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]'' Vol. 2 #1-2 (2006). He appeared as a member of the Hood’s criminal syndicate in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' Vol. 1 #35, 46, 50, 55-57, 60-61, 63-64 (2007–2010), ''New Avengers'' Annual #2 (2008), ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #6, #8 (2008), ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: [[Hood (comics)|The Hood]]'' #1-2, 4-5 (2009), ''[[Marvel Zombies 4]]'' #2 (2009), ''Dark Reign: The Cabal'' #1 (2009), ''[[Captain America]]: [[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' #1 (2010) and ''New Avengers: Finale'' #1 (2010).

==Fictional character biography==
William Cross was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. He later became an interrogation expert for the CIA. Cross was already building his own rogue covert operations when he romanced federal corrections officer Rozalyn Backus with whom he developed ultrasonic brainwashing technology. Backus was unaware of Cross' illicit activities, and they were engaged to be married until Cross stole the technology and disappeared. In his disappearance, he faked his own murder and framed Backus for the murder. Surviving an attempt on his life, which cost him his left eye and his left ear, he replaced them with cybernetic implants and became a prosperous high-tech freelance subversive as Crossfire.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotting to make the growing superhero community exterminate each other via ultrasonic mind control, Crossfire abducted the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to test his technology. [[Moon Knight]] (Marc Spector) interfered and Crossfire was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two-in-One'' #52&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire secretly rebuilt his operations at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] (or CTE for short) which was founded by his cousin [[Darren Cross]]. When [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] investigated, Crossfire first tried to eliminate them using the assassins [[Bombshell (Marvel Comics)|Bombshell]], [[Oddball (comics)|Oddball]], and [[Silencer (comics)|Silencer]]. When his three assassins failed, Crossfire decided Hawkeye would make an ideal test subject for his super hero mind control plot, because Hawkeye was prominent enough in the super hero community to attract them en masse at his funeral and weak enough to be an easy target. Hawkeye thwarted the brainwashing, captured the criminals and rescued Mockingbird, and they married shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' Vol.1 #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

A vengeful Crossfire subsequently stalked the newlyweds to the estate of former film star [[Moira Brandon]]. The elderly actress was declared an honorary Avenger after helping Hawkeye and Mockingbird recapture the supervillain.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' Vol.2 #100&lt;/ref&gt; The juggling supervillain team known as the [[Death-Throws]] freed Crossfire from police custody. But when he proved unable to pay them, they held Crossfire for ransom until [[Captain America]], Hawkeye and Mockingbird captured the whole gang.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #317&lt;/ref&gt; Crossfire later escaped and placed a bounty on Hawkeye's arm, hoping to destroy the hero's skills and break the archer's spirit. An army of supervillains (including [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], [[Bobcat (comics)|Bobcat]], [[Razor Fist]], [[Bullet Biker (comics)|Bullet Biker]] and the Death-Throws) look to claim the reward, but are defeated by Hawkeye, Mockingbird and [[Trickshot (comics)|Trickshot]]. With the bounty hunting supervillains captured, Hawkeye pursues Crossfire through the sewers. Crossfire is knocked off the edge of an outfall dam and is left clinging on for his life. Hawkeye contemplates letting his foe fall to his doom and ending the feud between them once and for all. The archer ultimately saves Crossfire's life, letting him rot in prison instead.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Spotlight'' #24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire was among the army of technology based supervillains recruited by [[Lucia Von Bardas]] to attack [[Nick Fury]] and a group of superheroes who were involved in a [[Secret War (comics)|secret war]] in [[Latveria]] a year earlier. The hired supervillains were revealed to each be a component of a bomb designed to destroy the city. Fury and the heroes were able to foil the plot and arrested the supervillains involved, including Crossfire.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret War'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during one of his prison stays, he befriended Vector of the [[U-Foes]] whose secret power nullification technology he had hoped to exploit. Recaptured following an encounter with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he was imprisoned in the Vault where Rozalyn Backus (long since exonerated) was a member of the Vault's [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] force. Seemingly aiding and then foiling an escape plot by the U-Foes and Crossfire, Backus turned the criminals against each other, faked her own death, and stole a fortune in cash and goods from the criminals, including Vector's power nullification chamber (which Backus later claimed to have secretly destroyed due to feeling it was too dangerous to preserve). The criminals were later transferred to the new Raft super-prison, and all escaped during [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s mass breakout, with Crossfire leading a gang of his fellow mind-manipulators: [[Controller (comics)|Controller]], [[Corruptor (comics)|Corruptor]], [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] and [[Mister Fear]]. Pursuing Backus, the chamber and their grudges against each other, the U-Foes and Crossfire's gang fought a super-powered gang war in New York until [[Spider-Man]], Captain America and [[Iron Man]] broke it up. Crossfire and his gang were recaptured (except Corruptor) and Backus surrendered herself to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Breakout'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the Death-Throws, Crossfire was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Splinter groups|R.A.I.D]] to take part in a terror plot in [[London]], only to be foiled by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]], [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine|Contessa Fontaine]], [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] and the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]]. Crossfire was knocked from the top of [[Tower Bridge]] and fell to the [[River Thames]] below. He was believed to have perished when he didn't resurface.&lt;ref&gt;''Union Jack'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire is revealed to have survived the fall and is among the supervillains gathered by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] looking to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers #35''&lt;/ref&gt; Crossfire becomes a member of the Hood's crime syndicate who go on to battle the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. He is seen battling his old enemy Clint Barton as [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers Annual'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire appears is part of the Hood's crime syndicate that come together with the superheroes to battle the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] force in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #6 &amp; 8&lt;/ref&gt; After the Skrull invasion was thwarted, the Hood's criminal army (including Crossfire) fights against the New Avengers laying in wait for [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers]]. Once again, Crossfire is seen battling Ronin and Mockingbird.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #50&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire is later seen conferring with the Hood to discuss the [[Marvel Zombies|zombie virus]]. Whereas the Hood wishes to use the virus to gain more power and influence in the world, Crossfire protests, explaining that one of the reasons he was compelled to ally himself with the Hood was that 'world-conquering' schemes would be avoided. Crossfire is quickly put in his place with a single stern gaze from the supervillain kingpin.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and Dr. Jonas Harrow, Crossfire and the rest of the Hood's crime syndicate rebel against their leader and seek out to make their own deal with Osborn. They attack and defeat the New Avengers and subdue the Dark Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #55-58&lt;/ref&gt; Crossfire was part of the Hood's criminal army that took part in the [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], an event orchrestrated by Osborn. After the battle was over and the heroes had won, Crossfire managed to evade capture and branched out on his own once more.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawkeye and Mockingbird thwart Crossfire's illegal arms dealings, much to the supervillain's anger. He is later confronted by [[Phantom Rider (Jaime Slade)|Jaime Slade]] (the new [[Phantom Rider]]) suggesting that they form an alliance. Together, along with Crossfire's new robotic army of Death T.H.R.O.W.S. (Techno Hybrid Remotely Operated Weapons Systems), the villainous pair plot to destroy the lives of the two heroes. Crossfire and the Phantom Rider are ultimately foiled, but not before Crossfire almost succeeds in killing Hawkeye and Mockingbird, severely wounds Mockingbird's mother, and murders [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade]]. As a result, Crossfire is captured and viciously beaten by Hawkeye. Despite being imprisoned with numerous injuries, Crossfire takes away a small victory in knowing that he has pushed Hawkeye to a breaking point.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye later discovered that [[Baron Zemo]] was the mysterious &quot;benefactor&quot; behind Crossfire's illegal arms dealings.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye: Blindspot'' #3-4 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luke Cage]] tells Hawkeye that, as long as Luke is the leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Crossfire will never be given the opportunity to be part of the team.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Rogers had already recommended that Crossfire should not be considered for the Thunderbolts program due to his technological prowess that could see the supervillain override the nanite system used to control the inmates.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heroic Age: Villains'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire was hired as part of [[Misty Knight]]'s &quot;Villains for Hire&quot; team in a battle against the [[Purple Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Villains for Hire'' #1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire was later recruited by Max Fury to join the [[Shadow Council]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Avengers'' #29&lt;/ref&gt; He is later seen in Bagalia being paid off by [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] to let [[Taskmaster]] out of imprisonment at the time when the [[Secret Avengers]] raid Bagalia to recruit Taskmaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire was hired by his second cousin [[Augustine Cross]] to capture [[Cassandra Lang]] for Cross Technological Enterprises due to Augustine's belief that Cassandra's Pym Particle-irradiated heart could sustain Darren Cross's body.&lt;ref&gt;''Ant-Man'' Vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossfire later accompanied Darren Cross in the Yellowjacket armor and [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] into attacking Scott Lang during his trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Ant-Man'' #13''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Crossfire has no superhuman powers, but is a highly trained former CIA operative. He is an expert marksman with proficient unarmed combat skills and extensive espionage training. Crossfire is a master of brainwashing techniques and has been known to develop his own technology to further these skills. With his gifted intellect, Crossfire is an expert in the field of robotics and cybernetics. He also has specialized knowledge of applied ultrasonics. Crossfire created the &quot;undertaker&quot; machine, a brainwashing device which employs ultrasonic waves to stimulate rage in the emotion centers of his victims' brains.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye'' vol. 1 #4&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosion caused Crossfire to lose his left eye, left ear, and 85% loss of hearing in his right ear. His left eye was replaced with an infrared imaging device which affords him a semblance of sight even in total darkness, while his left ear was replaced by an audio sensor that is far more sensitive than the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Two in One'' #52&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of natural hearing in his right ear has resulted in Crossfire being unaffected by his own ultrasonic technology. His costume is made of Kevlar and has special hidden compartments containing various weaponry and devices. Crossfire uses twin handguns and a sniper rifle as his weapons of choice.

==Death-Throws==
In the past, Crossfire was known to employ the supervillain group, the [[Death-Throws]], as his foot soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #317&lt;/ref&gt; However, deciding to leave behind the &quot;fifth rate hacks in ridiculous costumes&quot;, Crossfire created a new army for himself. His &quot;Death T.H.R.O.W.S&quot;. (Techno Hybird Remotely Operated Weapons Systems) are robotic constructs that obey only his commands and each carry a small capable arsenal concealed within their armored shells.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the robotic Death T.H.R.O.W.S. were known as 'Magnum Z's'.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroic Age: Villains'' #1 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The Magnum Z's were fully automated smart soldiers created for the United States. But the US senate ceased their development when they realised that the Magnum Z's abilities were in conflict with the [[Geneva Convention]]. Crossfire acquired some of the defunct Magnum Z's to use in a plot to conquer the Isle of El Guapo,&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #40-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; then later adapted them for his own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird'' #3 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
An alternate version of Crossfire appears in the 2000 three issue [[limited series]] ''Avataars: Covenant of the Shield'', where the Marvel Universe is re-imagined in a fantasy setting. In this reality, Crossfire is known as Iron Cross and is a member of the [[Masters of Evil|Minions of Evil]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avataars: Covenant of the Shield'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
* Crossfire appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. This version is a former criminal partner of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]. In the episode &quot;To Steal an Ant-Man&quot;, William Cross and his men (consisting of [[Big Ben Donovan]], [[Dontrell Hamilton|Dontrell &quot;Cockroach&quot; Hamilton]], [[Gideon Mace]], Ray &quot;Piranha&quot; Jones, and [[Spear (comics)|Spear]]) kidnapped [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]] so that Scott could pay the money owed to him. After Scott obtains the money via the stolen Ant-Man costume, William met up with Scott to get paid off. However, Cross thought that his ex-partner was Ant-Man all along and alters the deal. Just then, [[Hank Pym]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] help fight Cross' henchmen. After Scott gets Cassie to safety, Cross ends up defeated by Scott.

'''Crowley''' is a [[fictional character]] on the American paranormal drama television series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' who is portrayed by actor [[Mark A. Sheppard]], and is the King of Hell. Introduced in [[Supernatural (season 5)|season five]], Sheppard has appeared a recurring role in every season since then, and was eventually promoted to series regular in the [[Supernatural (season 10)|tenth season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;promoted&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Prudon |first=Laura |url= http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/supernatural-season-10-mark-sheppard-series-regular-1201190067/ |title=‘Supernatural’ Season 10: Mark Sheppard Promoted to Series Regular |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2014-05-23 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His portrayal of Crowley has been met with positive reception from both critics and fans of the series. His name is inspired by [[Aleister Crowley]].

==Plot==
Crowley is introduced in mid-way through [[Supernatural (season 5)|Season 5]] in the episode &quot;Abandon All Hope...&quot;, having first been mentioned near the end of the previous episode, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, when series protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester]] learn that Crowley&amp;mdash;not [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], as was previously believed&amp;mdash;had been the one who took [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)#The Colt|The Colt]] from [[Bela Talbot]] in the [[Supernatural (season 3)|Season 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Real Ghostbusters |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=November 12, 2009 |season=5 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following episode, they track down and confront him. Although his guards capture the brothers, Crowley uses The Colt to kill his own men before explaining that he shares the Winchesters' goal of them killing [[Characters of Supernatural#Lucifer|Lucifer]], as he suspects that Lucifer would kill all [[Characters of Supernatural#Demons|demons]] once he has killed all humans. Crowley gives The Colt to the brothers to use to kill Lucifer and then informs them of Lucifer's location so that they can find him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Abandon All Hope |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=November 19, 2009 |season=5 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When The Colt fails to kill Lucifer, Crowley is forced to go on the run to evade retribution from the forces of Hell for his betrayal. Learning of the Winchesters' new plan to stop Lucifer by trapping him in his cage in Hell once again using [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|the Horsemen]]'s rings, Crowley again aids the brothers in &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; to help them find [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse#As infectious disease|Pestilence]] and retrieve his ring by orchestrating the capture of a high-ranking demonic minion of Pestilence's and ultimately manipulating the demon into revealing Pestilence's location. He then manipulates the Winchesters' long-time ally [[Bobby Singer]] to &quot;lend&quot; him his soul in order for them to find Death, with Crowley assuring Bobby that he will rescind his claim on Bobby's soul once Lucifer is imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Devil You Know |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=April 29, 2010 |season=5 |number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is soon revealed that he actually wants Bobby's soul to prevent the brothers from killing him after they stop Lucifer. Despite ever-increasing animosity between himself and the rest of the group, Crowley helps Dean recover the final ring from Death.&lt;ref name=&quot;midnight&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Two Minutes to Midnight |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=May 6, 2010 |season=5 |number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supernatural (season 6)|Season 6]] episode &quot;Weekend at Bobby's&quot; reveals that Crowley went back on his promise to Bobby and plans to keep Bobby's soul, telling him that he will give him the ten years left of life customary for [[Faust]]ian deals before he has him killed and brought to Hell. Eventually, however, Crowley is forced to return Bobby's soul to save his own life. The same episode establishes Crowley's [[backstory]]: he had been a 17th-century [[Scotsman]] named Fergus MacLeod whose own son, Gavin, hated him as much as he himself hated Gavin.

Though reluctant to risk crossing the new god-like Castiel, Crowley once again secretly aid the Winchesters in [[Supernatural (season 7)|Season 7]] premiere &quot;Meet the New Boss&quot;, this time in trying to defeat Castiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Meet the New Boss |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=September 23, 2011 |season=7 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Characters of Supernatural#Leviathans|Leviathans]] are released into the world from Castiel's body, Crowley attempts to strike an alliance with their leader, [[Characters of Supernatural#Richard Roman|Dick Roman]], but Dick scoffs at the idea of an alliance between their kind, instead insulting and threatening Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Slash Fiction |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=October 28, 2011 |season=7 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Crowley orders his demons to refrain from attacking Sam and Dean, to allow the Winchesters to wipe out the Leviathans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Season Seven, Time for a Wedding! |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=November 11, 2011 |season=7 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it turns out that Crowley's blood is needed to construct a weapon to kill the Leviathans, he agrees on the condition that they retrieve the other components of the weapon first.

In [[Supernatural (season 8)|Season 8]], Crowley breaks off his alliance with the Winchesters and acts as an [[antagonist]] towards them, as they seek to seal all demons in Hell forever by completing three trials described in a Word of God tablet about demons.&lt;ref name=&quot;kevintalk&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=We Need to Talk About Kevin |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=October 3, 2012 |season=8 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Trial and Error |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=February 13, 2013 |season=8 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley himself wants to use the tablet to unleash all demons onto Earth,&lt;ref name=&quot;kevintalk&quot;/&gt; and so hunts the tablet and the only one who can read it&amp;mdash;the [[Characters of Supernatural#Prophets|prophet]] [[Characters of Supernatural#Kevin Tran|Kevin Tran]]&amp;mdash;relentlessly, but can only secure one broken-off half of the tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Little Slice of Kevin |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=November 14, 2012 |season=8 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later becomes interested in a tablet on angels as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Torn and Frayed |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=January 16, 2013 |season=8 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Goodbye Stranger |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=March 20, 2013 |season=8 |number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, he attempts to sabotage the second trial Sam and Dean are trying to finish, by dragging the deceased Bobby's soul back to Hell where he had it trapped earlier through use of a [[Psychopomp|reaper]] working for him. He flees when the angel [[Characters of Supernatural#Naomi|Naomi]] is about to attack him, and the trial is ultimately completed. However, the episode ends with Crowley successfully capturing Kevin once again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Taxi Driver |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=April 3, 2013 |season=8 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; trying to kill him after Kevin proves that he cannot be tricked or threatened into translating the half of the demon tablet.

Although Crowley manages to make a distress call to other demons, the only one who shows up is [[Characters of Supernatural#Abaddon|Abaddon]], who attacks Crowley, planning to take over Hell after killing him. Sam saves him from Abaddon and Crowley soon starts showing human emotion from the effects of Sam's blood, but the process is stopped before it is fully completed, as Sam and Dean learn that completing the last trial would require Sam's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sacrifice |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=May 15, 2013 |season=8 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley's increased humanity prompts him to keep Gavin alive in the present to spare him the death he had experienced in his own time, and to reconcile much of their mutually hateful relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=King of the Damned |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=May 6, 2014 |season=9 |number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the season finale &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot;, Crowley reveals that he has stopped drinking human blood. At the end of the episode, he oversees Dean's transformation into a demon from the Mark and invites the newborn demon to join him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Do You Believe In Miracles? |series=Supernatural |serieslink=Supernatural (U.S. TV series) |network=[[The CW Television Network]] |airdate=May 20, 2014 |season=9 |number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Reichenbach&quot;, Crowley and Dean are living it up away from everything. However, Crowley gets impatient with Dean's refusal to give up his new life and come to Hell with him to rule at his side. To feed the Mark, Crowley sends Abaddon supporters to Dean to kill and has him fulfill a crossroads deal for him by killing a man's wife and is annoyed when Dean kills the man instead. As Dean starts to get too out of his control, Crowley turns on him, calling Sam and letting him know where Dean is in exchange for the First Blade. In &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, Crowley returns to rule of Hell, executing Abaddon supporters, but finds his time with Dean to be causing him problems. To solve this, Crowley saves Castiel and Hannah from the rogue angel Adina and gives Castiel her grace so he can stop Dean by whatever means necessary, whether they be helping cure him or kill him. In &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, Crowley learns of the demonic brothel run by two of his demons and while disgusted as he finds it &quot;tacky&quot; rather than evil, orders one to track down the witch who destroyed the brothel. Crowley's demons capture the witch despite the Winchesters interference and Crowley is shocked to learn that the witch is his mother, Rowena. In &quot;The Things We Left Behind&quot;, Crowley rebuffs Rowena's efforts to bond with him until she reveals that his demon minion Gerald has been trafficking demons to Earth. Crowley kills Gerald to save her, not knowing that Rowena was lying and lets her out of her cell. More of Crowley's backstory is revealed: Crowley's mother conceived him at an [[orgy]] and thus he grew up with no father. Rowena was a terrible mother who ended up abandoning him at age eight and never returning despite promising to, something Crowley holds a great deal of resentment towards her for. In &quot;The Hunter Games&quot;, Crowley continues to let Rowena roam free, but mistrusts her. Rowena plots against Crowley, making him have nightmares of being attacked by his demons and spying on a meeting with the Winchesters where they ask him for the First Blade back to help get rid of the Mark of Cain. Crowley reluctantly goes to retrieve the Blade from where he stashed it in a crypt in [[Guam]] with his bones, but discovers it missing. Returning to Hell, he finds that Rowena has killed his loyal demon Guthrie who stole the Blade for her. Crowley believes Rowena's lies about Guthrie and informs the Winchesters he will keep the Blade until they are ready to use it to remove the Mark. In Season 10 Episode 17, inside man, Crowley kicks Rowena out because he learns that she has been plotting against him and has been lying to him.

==Characterization==
Originally, Crowley is described as &quot;[[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]]'s right-hand man and King of the Crossroads&quot;, with the latter title referencing his role as the leader and &quot;the most powerful&quot; of the crossroad demons, a special subgroup of demons in ''Supernatural'' who fulfill the traditional concept of a &quot;[[deal with the Devil]]&quot; for one's soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;road54&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Revised and Updated Edition |year=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-502-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the sixth season, Crowley has usurped&lt;ref name=&quot;road210&quot;/&gt; leadership of Hell, becoming &quot;the undisputed King of Hell&quot;. However, executive producer and current series showrunner, [[Jeremy Carver]], explained that Crowley &quot;actually doesn't care for [Hell] much&quot;, in contrast to Abaddon, his challenger for the crown in Season 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;road185&quot;/&gt; Nicholas Knight, author of various ''Supernatural'' supplementary materials, summarized Crowley as &quot;nasty, cocky, brutally honest, and wickedly funny&quot;, and wrote that, &quot;If [Crowley] weren't such a bad guy, he'd make one amazing hero&amp;mdash;although technically he ''is'' a hero to the forces of evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;road210&quot;/&gt;

Starting in the eighth season finale &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, Crowley began exposing a &quot;new emotional vulnerability&quot; as a result of an unfinished demon-curing ritual performed on him in the episode and a resulting addiction to human blood in Season 9. On this topic, executive producer Robert Singer said that Crowley's secret enjoyment of his temporary sense of humanity influenced the character throughout the ninth season.&lt;ref name=&quot;road210&quot;/&gt; However, a statement from Carver raised the possibility that Crowley might not retain this humanity in Season 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;road211&quot;/&gt;

==Development==
Maureen Ryan of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' disclosed in her October 9, 2009 review of fifth season episode &quot;Fallen Idols&quot; that &quot;the ubiquitous and talented [[Mark Sheppard]]&quot; had been cast as the &quot;pivotal&quot; demon character Crowley in the upcoming episode &quot;Abandon All Hope...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |url= http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/10/supernatural-fallen-idols-paris-hilton.html |title='Supernatural's' 'Fallen Idols': Let's talk about it, plus news of an 'epic' episode |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheppard had previously worked with ''Supernatural'' producer and director [[Kim Manners]] on ''[[The X-Files]]''. Sheppard revealed in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' on November 11, 2014 that he and Manners had discussed the possibility of Sheppard appearing on ''Supernatural'', but that Manners had died before Sheppard ultimately landed his role as Crowley. In the same interview, Sheppard also revealed that when reading the script for &quot;Abandon All Hope&quot;, he &quot;got the giggles&quot; and took the part partially to honor Manners and partially out of appreciation for the work of writer [[Ben Edlund]], as Edlund had written for ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', another show on which Sheppard appeared.&lt;ref name= &quot;oralhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Prudom |first=Laura |url= http://variety.com/2014/tv/spotlight/supernatural-oral-history-200-episodes-ackles-padalecki-kripke-1201352537/ |title=‘Supernatural’ at 200: The Road So Far, An Oral History |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exclusive interview with [[Michael Ausiello]] on July 15, 2010, series creator [[Eric Kripke]] confirmed that Crowley would return in the show's sixth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/07/15/supernatural-season-6-spoilers/|title=Exclusive: 'Supernatural' boss on why he stepped down and what's coming up (hint: monsters!)|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight felt that &quot;Crowley's journey on the show has been a bold and ambitious one&quot;. On the Season 9 subplot of Crowley's human blood addiction, he wrote that it was &quot;one of the most interesting and unexpected subplots of [the] season...and it left a lasting (and often amusing) impression on viewers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;road210&quot;/&gt; Carver, too, enjoys the character, stating, &quot;He's pure evil, but, in an odd sort of way, we find him likeable. He's so much fun to write.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;road185&quot;/&gt;

When discussing plots that had been either set up or not resolved by the end of Season 9, Knight cited the developments in Crowley's story, questioning what the character plans to do with the demonic version of Dean he beckoned to in the closing moments of &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot; He also questioned Crowley's plans for demons at large under his control, and how Hell may or may not change.&lt;ref name=&quot;road219&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Revised and Updated Edition |year=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-502-4|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical response to Sheppard's characterization of Crowley has been largely positive. In a review of the episode &quot;Blade Runners&quot; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'''s Vulture website, Price Peterson wrote, &quot;This whole enemy-of-my-enemy relationship between the Winchesters and Crowley is one of the most compelling dynamics this series has seen, and as long as ''Supernatural'' keeps Crowley constantly on the verge of redemption, I see no end to its emotional rewards.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;blood&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Price |url= http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/supernatural-recap-season-9-episode-16.html |title=Supernatural Recap: Blood and Other Drugs |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the same episode, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' member Phil Dyess-Nugent wrote, &quot;Just how terrific is Mark A. Sheppard? There was a time, not so very long ago, when I would have tagged this as a trick question, but Sheppard has been playing Crowley long enough to have gotten comfortable in the part and grateful for the chance to do new things with it, and he carries 'Blade Runners' in the palm of his hand.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;avcr&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Dyess-Nugent |first=Phil |url= http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/supernatural-blade-runners-202363 |title=Supernatural: &quot;Blade Runners&quot; |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[io9]], [[Charlie Jane Anders]] praised Sheppard's &quot;impeccable comic timing, and his ability to sell an entire scene with afew ''[sic]'' well-chosen facial expressions.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;better&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Anders |first=Charlie Jane |url= http://io9.com/crowley-really-does-make-everything-on-supernatural-100-1506988780 |title=Crowley really does make everything on Supernatural 100 percent better |work=[[io9]]|date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan reaction to Crowley has been described as being positive as well. The character was described as a &quot;fan-favorite&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;road185&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Revised and Updated Edition |year=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-502-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;one of the most iconic and popular characters on the show&quot; since his first appearance. &quot;He's a villain fans love to hate,&quot; Knight wrote, &quot;and no matter how difficult he makes Dean and Sam's lives, viewers are always thrilled by Crowley's devilish ways&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;road210&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Revised and Updated Edition |year=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-502-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding to Carver's warning that Crowley had not become truly human over the course of his Season 9 [[story arc]], that, &quot;A truly human Crowley is something fans would never really want anyway; it's much more fun rooting for a truly ''bad'' guy, especially when he's so darn entertaining.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;road211&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Nicholas|title=The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Revised and Updated Edition |year=2014|publisher=Insight Editions|isbn=1-60887-502-4|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and casting==
Carla was created as the estranged sister of [[Ellen Crozier]] and Elizabeth Easther was cast in the role.&lt;ref name=goodmorning&gt;{{cite episode|date=22 May 2012|series=[[Good Morning (New Zealand show)|Good Morning]]|station=[[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]|network=[[Television New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easther had just graduated from drama school and relished playing a human as her only other television role was that of a dinosaur in an Australian children's show.&lt;ref name=goodmorning/&gt; The role was set for a defined term due to the content of the storyline and as a result Easther ended up leaving after her contract expired, with the characters story coming to an end.&lt;ref name=goodmorning/&gt; Due to the characters psychotic nature, Easther struggled to get work for several years and was even rejected after being cast in a nappie commercial.&lt;ref name=goodmorning/&gt;

==Storylines==
Carla arrived to the street in 1995 to visit her estranged sister [[Ellen Crozier|Ellen]] ([[Robyn Malcolm]]) and soon got a job at the hospital. The two sisters reconciled when Carla fell off a cliff and the staff began to suspect Ellen of pushing her. Carla instantly clashed with [[Tiffany Pratt]] ([[Alison James]]) and she blackmailed her about her [[Hepatitis C]] diagnosis. Carla began to date Ellen's ex-boyfriend [[Bernie Leach]] ([[Timothy Bartlett]]) and the two soon eloped. Carla spiked Tiffany's drink, leading to her near death in front of a truck and many to turn against Carla. Carla sabotaged a surgery on Tiffany and she once again nearly died, something which Carla blamed on [[Johnny Marinovich]] (Stelios Yiakmis). Bernie grew sick of Carla and so she faked a pregnancy to keep him in the marriage however after a minor car crash whilst teaching her niece [[Minnie Crozier|Minnie]] ([[Katrina Devine]]) to drive, Carla claimed she had miscarried. When Bernie discovered Carla was unable to have children since her teens, he angrily assaulted her and was arrested; Carla went to stay with her mother.

Carla returned in late 1995 and manipulated an abusive parent to drive drunk, causing him to crash into the hospital and kill [[Carmen Roberts]] ([[Theresa Healey]]). Carla began a relationship with [[Sam Aleni]] ([[Rene Naufahu]]) and when Bernie returned after being acquitted of assault, she promised she would leave him after taking all his money. However, when an earthquake hit Ferndale and an injured Bernie insulted Carla, she took the opportunity and murdered him with a candlestick, blaming the quake. Many suspected Carla of his death. Eventually, Tiffany and Ellen unearthed evidence Carla had, in fact committed the crime, and Carla confessed. However, due to her fear of losing Sam, she retracted her statement, causing Sam to be arrested instead. While locked up, Sam's grandfather died, and Sam harshly rejected Carla. Carla would return home and slit her wrists. Ellen had her sectioned and when she went to visit her, Carla attempted to murder her. After realising that the institution was not the best option for Carla, she was taken to live with her mother.

'''Jesse Custer''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[comic book]] series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', created by writer [[Garth Ennis]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]] (with a large percentage of the original cover art painted by [[Glenn Fabry]]), published by the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint of [[DC Comics]].

He was ranked the 11th Greatest Comic Book Character by Empire Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters|url = http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=11|website = Empire|accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[IGN]] ranked Jesse Custer 34th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

==Character history==

===Early days===
Jesse is the son of John Custer, a [[U.S. Marine]] from Texas, and Christina L'Angelle, a troubled runaway. The couple met when Christina, encouraged by the [[Vietnam War]]-[[Demonstration (people)|protesting group]] she was traveling with, spat in the eye of the first soldier she saw returning from overseas. Despite the assault, the two recognized a sense of displacement in each other, and a relationship formed. Quickly, John and Christina fell deeply in love and gave birth to a son, Jesse.

During Jesse's early years, his father instilled a love of [[cowboy]]s and justice  in him. Their happiness was short-lived, however, as Christina's family finally caught up with them with the intention of bringing her home. Psychotic thugs [[Jody and T.C.]] were prepared to murder John until they realized he was the father of Christina's son and were obliged to take him along.

Jesse was taken back to the family home and introduced to his malicious, intelligent, yet decrepit Grandma, who began to teach him to both love and fear God. John and Christina were married, although John secretly vowed to escape with his family after a suitably safe period of time had passed. Sadly, they were caught during the escape attempt, and Jody killed John in front of young Jesse's eyes. After further torment from Jody, Jesse vowed never to cry again.

After that, Jesse was stuck with his new family, his only friend Billy-Bob, a one-eyed, inbred [[swamp]]-dweller. Gradually, however, his family managed to cruelly take these from him, too. Jesse was educated largely by his mother, while the sadistic Jody taught him [[mechanics]], fighting, and shooting. He was frequently punished by being placed in an airtight [[coffin]] and then submerged at the bottom of a river. Jesse's sanity was held intact by the company of a spirit taking the form of cowboy legend John Wayne. Whether this spirit is a genuine manifestation of the Western hero, or if it is simply a coping mechanism spawned from his movie-watching history with his father is uncertain. In either case, there's no question that Wayne held him together.

By his late teens, the death of his parents and his best friend Billy-Bob gave Jesse the necessary drive to escape the L'Angelle family and run away.

===After Angelville===
Jesse was a cocky young man, using his skills and good looks to get easy money and girls. Eventually, he ran into a woman who would change his life forever: [[Tulip O'Hare]]. The two fell in love and, along with Tulip's friend Amy, pursued a life of crime, stealing expensive cars and never getting caught. The three soon became indebted to a criminal who also stole horses to sell on the meat market. With the help of a former [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], Jesse and Tulip freed the horses and defeated the thieves, and Jesse [[hanging|hanged]] the [[French people|French]] meat-dealer for horse-[[rustling]] and murdering the ranger, whom Jesse had grown to like and respect (as seen in &quot;''Preacher: Tall in the Saddle''&quot;).

Jesse and Tulip enjoyed a high life of crime and sex on the highways &amp;mdash; Jesse planned on proposing to Tulip but the sudden reappearance of [[Jody and T.C.]] prevented that. Threatening to kill Tulip if he ever spoke to her again, Jesse simply 'disappeared' from her life and was pressed into the [[clergy]] by his Grandma. Finally admitting defeat and turning to [[alcohol]], he began practicing as reverend to an ungrateful and ignorant [[Texas]] town.

Soon enough, the [[John Wayne]] spirit that had appeared to Jesse now refused to talk to him. Jesse's desire to point out the hypocrisy of his congregations' lives was finally resolved when he chanced to encounter the comedian [[Bill Hicks]] (in either [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] or [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], as Jesse was a trifle too drunk to remember properly). Watching the performance of Hicks' cynical, caustic yet utterly truthful [[wit]] inspired Jesse to live to a higher standard; when he heard of Hicks' death, he decided to confront his congregation in the local bar, where he pointed out the residents' dirty little secrets. Eventually, Jesse was cut short when he accused a drunk of having [[rape]]d a [[hitchhiker]].  The rapist, whose father had paid off the judge, beat Jesse unconscious with a [[pool cue]].

===Finding God===

====Genesis====
During a [[sermon]] the day after he was attacked in the bar, Jesse was suddenly struck by a [[supernatural]] force later identified as Genesis, grafting itself to Jesse's [[soul]] and releasing an explosion of energy that destroyed the church and the town, killing the whole population. By a well-timed coincidence, Tulip had hitched a lift with an [[Irishman]] named [[Cassidy (DC Comics)|Cassidy]] after having just bungled her first job as an [[assassination|assassin]]. The two discovered Jesse among the rubble of the church and, after some discussion, agreed to help him to safety, although Tulip was still furious with Jesse over his sudden abandonment of her five years before. The death of the townsfolk and the rumored appearance of a stone-faced, dual-pistol wielding cowboy brought the involvement of both local law enforcement and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].

Through subsequent bloodshed and [[black humor]], the following is revealed:
* Merging with Genesis has given Jesse &quot;the Word of God,&quot; a power which forces the listener to obediently follow his commands, so long as the listener can hear and comprehend what is said. This power is signified by Jesse's eyes glowing an eerie red.
* The highly [[charisma]]tic Cassidy, while appearing to be human, is actually a [[vampire]] well into his 90s.
* The mysterious cowboy is the unstoppable [[Saint of Killers]], sent on a mission from [[Heaven]] to find Jesse and subsequently Genesis.
* Genesis is the result of a sexual union between an [[angel]] and a [[demon]], something not defined by good or evil, and perhaps more powerful than God Himself. It escaped its confinement in Heaven and fled to Earth, finding Jesse.
* When Genesis was born, God left Heaven, and no one knows where He went or why.

Much of this information was forced from an angel using Jesse's newfound power. Jesse also made a new friend in Cassidy after initially calling him an abomination for drinking blood. Unfortunately, Jesse also discovered he was being followed by the Saint of Killers, who was sent to hunt down the mortal who had merged with Genesis.

Following these revelations, Jesse decided to use his power to track God down and make Him face up to His own wrongdoings as Creator.

Jesse's quest for God would take on the form of an unconventional [[road trip]]. He visited many [[United States of America|American]] landmarks, including [[New York City]], [[Texas]], [[San Francisco]], and [[New Orleans]].

====Family Reunion====
While on the road, he was once again captured by [[Jody and T.C.]], who had almost given up on finding him again. This time, they took Tulip with them, too. Jesse tried to use the Word of God on Jody, but it apparently had no effect on him. Jesse was returned to Grandma, who allowed him one final night with Tulip. Jesse explained to her the events of his childhood, the murder of his father at the hands of Jody, and the real reason why he had to leave her five years before. When morning came, Grandma sent in Jody, who shot Tulip in the head with his handgun. A broken man, Jesse lost all hope.

The following day, [[God]] visited Tulip's [[Dead body|corpse]] and returned her to life, commanding her to persuade Jesse to give up his quest. Tulip refused, believing God to be using her [[resurrection]] as a [[bribe]] to get Jesse to end his quest. Meanwhile, John Wayne's spirit slowly convinced the devastated Jesse to fight back against his captors and finally collect on all the pain they had caused him throughout his life.

While imprisoned in his room, Jesse tried the Word on T.C. again and was grimly satisfied to see it work. Jesse beat T.C. to a bloody pulp, set fire to Grandma's clan, and battled Jody in a final showdown, eventually breaking his back, strangling him to death and reclaiming his father's [[Zippo]] lighter. Tulip shot T.C. dead, and Grandma was killed when the burning house ignited her [[oxygen]] tank, sending her rocketing into the sky like a fiery comet.

Reunited, Jesse and Tulip shared a passionate kiss, finally free from the demons of Jesse's past.

====Cassidy &amp; The Grail====
While helping Cassidy track down the man responsible for giving his [[Substance dependence|junkie]] girlfriend a large amount of [[heroin]] to stash, Jesse met &quot;The Grail,&quot; a sinister organization who have been tasked with finding and capturing Jesse. The [[secret society]] was headed by a [[pope]]-like figure named [[Allfather D'Aronique]], and his right-hand man, The Sacred Executioner, a [[German people|German]] military expert referred to as [[Herr Starr]]. While the All-Father wished to capture Jesse in retaliation for the death of his distant aunt (Jesse's grandmother), Starr heard of Jesse's power and planned to use him to bring on [[Armageddon]] so they could take over the world.

The Grail took Cassidy, believing him to be Jesse, and flew him to a hidden base in [[France]] named [[Masada]], where Cassidy maintained the deception. He was found out, however, and the Grail repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) attempted to kill him. Jesse traveled to [[France]] to recover Cassidy, believing that they share a bond. He was unwilling to endanger Tulip's life in a rescue attempt, however, and left her while she slept.

Jesse rescued Cassidy, but not without incurring Starr's wrath and inadvertently helping to elevate him to the level of All-Father of the Grail. The [[Saint of Killers]] was now after Jesse for information regarding his past that might be locked into Genesis' memories. Cassidy, Jesse, and Tulip were reunited again, but Tulip was angry that Jesse did not trust her to handle herself in a [[Battle|firefight]]. When Cassidy made a clumsy pass at her, however, she returned to Jesse's arms and began to distrust the [[vampire]].

Jesse realized that his only chance of finding [[God]] lay in the memories of Genesis. He traveled to [[Monument Valley]], where he hoped a [[psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]] might hold the key to unlocking them. Starr found him, however, and used his Grail authority to order a massive military support, eventually deploying a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]]. Attempting to flee the blast in a private [[jet aircraft|jet]], Jesse was thrown from the plane after ordering Cassidy not to risk his life saving him.

Much to his own surprise, Jesse found himself alive and well in the desert, having miraculously survived the fall but inexplicably missing an eye. Initially, he had no memory of what happened after Cassidy dropped him, and it would not be until later that he remembered: [[God]] appeared and explained that He saved Jesse to show that He loves him and that he should abandon his [[quest]]. Jesse refused and attempted to use his power; however, [[God]] attacked him, biting out his left eye and leaving him a wreck. Before finishing the job, [[God]] fled when He detected the [[Saint of Killers]] approaching. Though physically ruined, Jesse happily realized that [[God]] was afraid of the Saint.

====Betrayal &amp; Salvation====
Jesse was found by a hermit in the desert, having lost his memory of his encounter with [[God]]. After recuperating for a month, Jesse set off to find Tulip and Cassidy. When he found them, however, he saw Cassidy embracing Tulip intimately and collapsed in shock. Believing that Tulip had made her peace and moved on, Jesse temporarily put his quest for [[God]] on the back burner and found himself in a small town named [[Salvation, TX (DC Comics)|Salvation]].

The town was being abused by a local meat industrialist, a diminutive man named Odin Quincannon, and his band of thugs. Jesse was quickly given the position of [[Sheriff]]. There, he met Lorie, the sister of his childhood friend, Billy-Bob. Lorie lived with a one-armed woman named Jodie, whom Jesse eventually realized was his mother, Christina, suffering from [[amnesia]] from a gunshot wound delivered by Jody years previous. With added help from his female deputy, Cindy, and a German man named Gunther, Jesse fought back at Quincannon's criminal activity, going head-to-head with corporate lawyer Miss Oatlash, an [[sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]] fanatic who admired [[Adolf Hitler]] and secretly desired Jesse. After escaping Oatlash, Jesse confronted the tiny businessman who attempted to blow up the town during a storm, but was struck by [[lightning]] before doing so. A defeated man, Quincannon was eventually killed by Jesse in one of his meat storage rooms.

During his time in Salvation, Jesse became very close to Cindy, and the possibility of a romance blossomed between the two. However, both of them realized it would never work out, as Jesse was still in love with Tulip. This realization started Jesse on the road to forgiving Tulip, a process he began by setting out to learn what happened between her and Cassidy.

Meanwhile, Jesse's mother began a relationship with Gunther. Although Jesse was initially uncomfortable with the idea of his mother having a relationship, he came to like and respect Gunther, who supported him when Jesse needed the town's approval to go against Quincannon. Jesse believed Gunther's tale of having escaped from [[Germany]] because he was against the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime; however, with the help of one of Miss Oatlash's books on Nazi history, Jesse eventually discovered Gunther's story was a lie. When confronted, Gunther broke down and admitted that he was a fully participating [[SS]] officer. Although Gunther pleaded with Jesse to understand, believing that he was his chance for redemption, from Jesse's point of view he could not be forgiven for the acts he had committed as a Nazi. Jesse tossed him a rope and walked out, and it is later revealed that Gunther hanged himself without leaving any explanation.

Through another well-timed prompt from [[John Wayne|The Duke]]'s spirit, Jesse realized he was going to get back on the job he set out to do, and to bring the girl he loved to meet his mother. With the help of the hallucinogens he still had from Monument Valley, Jesse recovered his lost memories of his brush with God (and with it, the revelation that God feared the Saint). Furthermore, he came to a conclusion about God's motives. These two facts combined to give Jesse a new strategy for hunting down God.

===The End of the Road===
Jesse eventually discovered that Tulip had never truly betrayed him to Cassidy, as he had kept her dependent on drugs and alcohol after she thought Jesse had died. Tulip managed to escape the vampire's control, and fled back to her old friend Amy, who delivered the startling news that Jesse was alive and well and was in fact coming to Amy's place to begin his search for Tulip. Jesse and Tulip were reunited for the second time, and Tulip finally revealed Cassidy's true nature to Jesse.

Jesse found a homeless woman who was an old acquaintance of Cassidy's and discovered the fullness of his sins, including violence against women, [[theft]], [[prostitution]], murder, and [[Substance dependence|addiction]]. While disappointed in Cassidy, he was more angry that he had been tricked into thinking that he and Cassidy shared the same code of honor that he so fervently believed in.

When Cassidy showed up to reclaim Tulip, he was surprised to find Jesse alive. He grew agitated when confronted with what he'd done, and took a swing at Jesse in anger. Jesse made him leave, agreeing to meet up on a certain date to discuss their grudge.

While devising a plan to finally catch up with [[God]] and challenge Him, Jesse realized that he would be putting Tulip in danger once more. Ashamed that he still couldn't bear the risk of hurting her, he [[sedative|sedated]] her and left her in a hotel room while he took care of business, knowing this would be the final betrayal and that she would not forgive him a second time.

Jesse met with Cassidy, and they discussed his troubled past. Jesse eventually forced Cassidy to fight him, meaning to show his former friend what it feels like to be as vulnerable as all the women he had abused. The fight was one-sided, as Jesse beat Cassidy to a bloody pulp. Beaten and ashamed, Cassidy asked Jesse for help, saying that if a good man like Jesse can offer him his hand, then that's enough of a reason to believe he has to change his ways. Cassidy asked for Jesse's hand in forgiveness. When Jesse, showing signs of recognizing and being uncomfortable by the similarities, once again turned away, Cassidy accused him of not following his own code, that he wouldn't stand by his friends when they really need it (&quot;it's not so easy... when they're stuck on the road to hell, is it?&quot;). Jesse realized this was true and offered a hand to Cassidy – but it was partially a ruse and Cassidy knocked Jesse out, incapacitating him.

Cassidy turned to face the sun as it rose and thanked Jesse for being his friend and offering him his hand. As he died in flames, Jesse was shot by a [[sniper]] hiding on a rooftop under order from Herr Starr – who had been watching the whole fight with glee. Tulip arrived in time to kill Starr, but not to save Jesse, who had died instantly, covered in the ashes of his best friend.

===Alamo===
Shot down outside the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], Jesse's death would not be in vain, or, as it turns out, final. Having faced down the [[Saint of Killers]] (something no one had successfully done before), he had struck a bargain with him. Jesse's death would separate him from Genesis, the only occasion that would cause [[God]] to feel safe in returning to His seat in [[Heaven]], but God wouldn't know the Saint would be waiting with his twin [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colts]], guns that deliver wounds no less than fatal. When God returned to Heaven, He was shocked to find the entire angelic host slaughtered and the Saint waiting for Him. God was unable to move him, first with His holy wrath, and then with the promise of resurrecting the Saint's family. The Saint then shot and killed God, freeing the world from His corruption.

Before his confrontation with Jesse, Cassidy had visited a church and struck a deal of his own, promising God he would hand Jesse over as long as both his own life and Jesse's are spared.

Jesse, now [[resurrection|resurrected]] and with his lost eye restored, sought out Tulip, who explained she cannot and will not forgive him for betraying her a second time. On the verge of parting ways forever, Jesse tracked her down on horseback and asked for her to take him back. After seeing tears in his eyes for the first time since his father's death, Tulip accepted love for her and will to change as genuine.

The last panels show Cassidy, now human after his deal with God, watching the sunset and talking to himself, or rather out to Jesse, saying that he will try to act like a man.

==Powers and abilities==

===Skills and upbringing===
After the death of John Custer, Jesse is raised in Angelville by Christina Custer (named after the New Orleans native currently living in Atlanta), along with the corrupted influence of his grandmother and Jody.  Along with his Bible lessons, Christina also sought a more scholarly education.  After Christina was taken from him, Jesse continued to be raised by his grandmother, but his parents had already become a major influence on his personality and outlook. Jesse also learned how to fight and hunt and shoot, and became proficient in maintaining and fixing machinery, all taught by Jody. Jody's immense fighting ability obviously rubbed off on Jesse, who impressed Starr tremendously after Jesse had taken out some of his elite Grail soldiers and evaded capture in France.

His skills allow him to easily beat the superhumanly strong and fast vampire, Cassidy (at least until Cassidy sucker-punches him). Jesse explains that this is because Cassidy has never had to learn how to fight.

===The Word of God===
[[Image:JesseCusterWord.jpg|right|150px|frame|Jesse uses the Word of God]]
When his soul merged with the angel-demon entity Genesis, her powers were focused into what Jesse Custer would refer to as &quot;The Word of God.&quot;  When he uses the Word, his eyes turn red and his voice changes that sounds like &quot;nails scraping against [your] soul.&quot;  Although no one can resist his commands, his victims must be able to understand them.  For example, animals would ignore his commands, and a group of attacking French-speaking soldiers were able to resist him. Jesse prefers to keep his Word in reserve, using it only when he has to. However he has used the word for all sorts of situations before, from ordering a Ku Klux Klan member to 'shit himself' to calling in on a radio phone-in show and ordering the guests to tell America what is it they really want, with embarrassing results.

&quot;It's like a gun, you keep it in reserve and only bring it out when you have to, that's good. When you start waving it in a receptionist's face, that's bad.&quot; - Jesse Custer

===Genesis===
Genesis first appears as &quot;a comet with the face of an infant.&quot;  After the emergence of Genesis, Jesse is told that she knows the secrets of heaven and hell.  It is sometimes a conscious exchange of information, but it also appears in the form of dreams and hallucinations.  His &quot;imaginary friend&quot; John Wayne reappears since Custer became a minister, and for the first time gives Jesse information he could not have known on his own.  He would regularly reappear to give Jesse general advice and notably telling him to leave Salvation because he's just treading water.  After the death of Jesse, Genesis reemerges, but now has the face of an adult as she has grown within Jesse's soul.

'''Cyber''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted usually as an enemy of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Sam Kieth]], he first appeared in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #85 (September 1991), though his appearance was obscured by a trench coat and hat. He was first fully seen and named in ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #86 (September 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Cyber, or &quot;Silas Burr&quot; as he is known, is believed to have been born in Canada.  He was an agent for the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], and in the spring of 1912, was eventually put on trial in [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. He was found guilty on 22 counts of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Escaping from the courthouse, Cyber arrived at a Western Canadian military base, finding in the Canadian Army a new employer named Frederick Hudson, who took special interest in his unique ability to push the men under his command beyond their moral and emotional limits. Cyber's earliest known confrontation with Logan seemingly occurred around [[World War I]], where he served as Logan's brutal drill instructor during his early days in the military. Cyber is given instructions to focus his attention on Logan in particular, and eventually receives orders to murder a woman at the base known only as Janet, in whom Logan was interested romantically, to further dehumanize his conditioning. After witnessing her death at Cyber's hands, Logan attacks and is severely beaten as Cyber effortlessly gouges out Logan's left eye. This is Logan's most severe beating and defeat up to this point in his life and the resulting psychological effects result in a deep-seated fear of Cyber. Without any memory of Burr's abuse, Logan again finds himself under the command of Burr while enlisted with the [[Devil's Brigade]] during [[World War II]]. He introduces Logan to U.S. Army soldier [[Nick Fury]] for the clandestine rescue mission of [[Captain America]] from German occupied Northern Africa.

Returning from [[Indochina]] for nine months in 1959, Burr would train his finest student, Logan's son, [[Daken]], before the boy is secretly ordered to destroy the training camp and everyone associated with it, including its commander. Eviscerated and shot by Daken, Burr is spared from death, as he was chosen by Romulus to be the prototype for the adamantium bonding process and has the metal permanently bonded to his skin.

It has been suggested, by Cyber himself, that he once ran with the notorious Edinburgh killer, [[Burke and Hare murders|William Burke]], and took part in the heinous [[West Port murders]] of 1828.

=== Modern era ===
In the modern era, Cyber resurfaces in [[Madripoor]], as an enforcer for an unnamed [[Illegal drug trade|drug cartel]], where he interferes between the rival crime cartels of Wolverine's ally [[Jessan Hoan|Tiger Tyger]] and General Coy. With the exception of his adamantium enhancements, Cyber's appearance remains unchanged, indicating that he ages much slower than an ordinary human. Wolverine, after running from the fight and barely escaping with his life from their latest encounter, eventually manages to overcome his fear of Cyber in order to save Tyger's life, as he bites out the villain's left eye before he falls into a truck full of the powerful hallucinogens he had earlier used on Wolverine, leading Cyber to run screaming into the forest and disappear at the ocean's edge.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents #85 - 92 (Summer of 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber later confronts the mutant team of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] alongside the female criminal organization called the [[Hell's Belles]], who are being mentored by Cyber as enforcers for an unnamed drug cartel. [[Shrew (comics)|Shrew]], a former member of the 'Belles' wishes to testify against the cartel, and Cyber and his team are ordered to silence her. Cyber defeats X-Factor's [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] first, concerned over her magnetic powers. He manages to poison [[Strong Guy]] with his claws, and attempts to ransom the antidote in exchange for Shrew. However, Strong Guy is saved due to the scientific resources of the United States government. In a later battle in a subway train station, Shrew manages to push Cyber into the path of an oncoming train driven by X-Factor's leader, [[Val Cooper]], and he disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor #80 - 82 (July - September 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

He next surfaces on the distant island of Koma Koi as an agent for the mysterious death-cult known as The Coven, hired to steal a mystical gem called the Tear of Heaven, and kidnap its guardian priestess, Kayla. Wolverine, who happens to be vacationing on the island, recognizes Cyber's scent on Kayla and tracks Cyber to The Coven. The two are eventually shackled to each other by an adamantium chain, and will fight each other incessantly unless gassed unconscious or lowered into an acid pit. Crossing a rope bridge, Wolverine eventually gains the upper hand and strangles Cyber with their shackles. Hanging by his throat and lacking an adamantium windpipe, he releases the chain and disappears as he falls into the dark jungle.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents #132 - 136 (Summer of 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber is next seen back in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] where he again engages Wolverine in battle. Recalling his part in the West Port murders long ago, he announces his intention to kill Wolverine and feed him to the deathwatch beetles to steal his adamantium skeleton.  However, Cyber is unaware that the adamantium laced to Wolverine's skeleton has been recently removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Despite this, and despite the fact that many of Wolverine's other mutant attributes were weakened, he manages to hold his own against Cyber briefly. Cyber is momentarily distracted by the distant cannon fire of [[Edinburgh Castle]] as Wolverine extracts his bone claws and slashes Cyber across the face. Cyber, unimpressed by the attack and annoyed by this turn of events, quickly slams Wolverine to the ground and uses his foot to break the bone claws off of Wolverine's right arm before their fight is interrupted, allowing Wolverine the opportunity to escape Cyber once more. Using his amplified brain-wave tracking power, he chases the poisoned Logan to [[Muir Island]], where he is eventually outsmarted by [[Kitty Pride]] and captured by [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine #79 - 81 (March - May 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Cyber is later broken out of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], and taken to one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s corpse littered, ancient Egyptian fortresses. They run a series of tests to determine the strength and purity of Cyber's adamantium skin, then through a combined effort, they manage to trap him inside a vault and release a swarm of voracious, &quot;mutant&quot; deathwatch beetles, which devour the flesh from Cyber's entire body, beginning with his exposed face and eating the rest from the inside out. Cyber's adamantium carapace, which remains untouched, is then used in an unsuccessful attempt to re-implant adamantium onto Wolverine's skeleton by [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], leader of the Dark Riders.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine #93 - 96 (September - December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resurrection ===
Cyber resurfaced in astral form, making himself known to a powerful young mutant with childlike intelligence named Milo Gunderson. After possessing Milo's body, Cyber is easily able to suppress Milo's childlike psyche, coupling Milo's incredible strength with his own cunning intelligence. Intent on revenge, he sets off for the [[Tinkerer]], contracting him to perform the adamantium-epidermal bonding process once he has stolen the necessary liquid adamantium from storage in the [[Hague]]. Arriving in [[Brussels]], he is revealed to be behind the scenes in setting up the inevitable confrontation between [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and his son, [[Daken]]. At the culmination of the bloody battle between father and son, Cyber appears, complete in his new adamantium laced skin, and challenges not Wolverine, but Daken. After quickly gaining the upper hand in his fight with Daken, Cyber questions him on the whereabouts of his master. Daken refuses to answer and manages to flee, leaving Cyber and Wolverine alone. During the following battle, Cyber suffers from a heart attack, as Milo had a weak heart. Wolverine, upon discovering that Silas had previously instructed Daken, and is capable of tracking his location, spares him in exchange for information. As Silas starts retelling how, in 1912, he was saved from [[capital punishment]] by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and taken to Canada where he met the mysterious man known as &quot;Hudson&quot;, his condition worsens, and Wolverine is forced to bring him to the Tinkerer to help him with the needed treatment. Agreeing to construct an [[artificial pacemaker]] to stabilize Cyber's heart condition in exchange for the use of Logan's mysterious [[carbonadium]] synthesizer, The Tinkerer unwittingly affixes the radioactive device to Cyber's chest, before Logan disappears with the C-Synth and tosses it from a bridge into the water below.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins #11 - 15 (April - August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He resurfaced in a desolate town inside Northern Africa, commanding a local militant faction, and attempts to coerce Wolverine and Daken into cooperating with him in their hunt for Romulus, his personal motives remaining a mystery. After cooperating with Daken, Burr takes him to the abandoned farm somewhere in Saskatchewan, Canada where his transformation into &quot;Cyber&quot; took place nearly fifty years prior. Deceived by Daken's emotional powers, Cyber seemingly succumbs to the poisonous effects of the carbonadium pacemaker, his weakened heart condition, or both and collapses in pain as Daken steps on his medication. He was last seen left for dead by both Daken and Wolverine.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

Cyber is later killed by [[Ogun (comics)|Ogun]], who claims that he was a formidable opponent, then tries to sell his adamantium carapace to Dr. [[Abraham Cornelius]] after dissolving his flesh away by submerging his corpse in an acid bath.&lt;ref&gt;''Death of Wolverine'' #3 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Powers and abilities ==
===Original body===
Cyber is a mutant that possesses a number of superhuman abilities, some due to his natural mutation and some due to artificial enhancement. Cyber possesses some degree of [[superhuman strength]]. Though no limit has been explicitly given, his strength was sufficient to destroy a jeep with a single blow or slash open a bank vault door with ease.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #79&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber's skin was bonded with a layer of the near indestructible alloy [[adamantium]], with the exception of his face, using an unknown [[arc welding]] technique. As a result, most of Cyber's body was virtually invulnerable to physical injury. Cyber's adamantium skin has proven able to withstand all attacks against it, even by weapons composed of adamantium itself.

Housed within each of Cyber's fingers is a retractable adamantium claw. Each talon was tipped in either powerful hallucinogens or poisons that have proven capable of incapacitating Wolverine before his mutant healing factor could filter them out. The potent toxins are specifically designed to affect Wolverine and are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds. Cyber's adamantium claws were also capable of cutting almost any known material. The known exceptions are adamantium itself and [[Captain America's shield]], which is composed of a  vibranium and an experimental &quot;steel alloy&quot;.

After Wolverine gouged out Cyber's left eye in combat,&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Comics Presents'' #92&lt;/ref&gt; it was replaced with an artificial implant.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #80&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber also possesses a [[psionic]] ability that allows him to track specific brain wave patterns across great distances. The exact limit of Cyber's range is unknown, though it was greatly amplified after his over-exposure to the hallucinogens that coat his claws. Cyber has claimed he can track brain wave patterns from any location on earth, and was even able to allow his consciousness to leave his body entirely. It was this ability that allowed Cyber to survive in astral form following the attack by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant. He is well known in military circles, himself a veteran of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #17 (October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the criminal underworld, where he often hires himself out as a special enforcer or mentor. He is a talented, though quite sadistic and murderous, teacher of unarmed combat methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #27 (September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===New body===
Cyber's consciousness has recently taken possession of the body of a large, muscular mutant with childlike intelligence named Milo Gunderson. Milo is a mutant possessing some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which are not known. However, his strength is sufficient to decapitate a fully grown horse with a single punch. Whether or not Milo's body possesses any other natural superhuman abilities is unknown at this time.

Cyber also apparently retains his brainwave tracking ability within his new body.

Cyber has recently undergone a process in which adamantium has been laced to Milo's skin, with only his face left uncovered, as well as retractable talons on his fingertips. As a result, his body is highly resistant to all forms of injury, including assaults from weapons composed of adamantium. However, the mutant factor that made his body develop so fast and strong puts a lot of stress on his heart, which makes him dependent on the medicine his mother was giving him. After suffering from a heart attack, he received a &quot;pacemaker&quot;, mounted to his chest, fabricated from the deadly, radioactive element [[carbonadium]]. His face is beginning to show signs of blistering, possibly from its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #31 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; As his condition worsened, he collapsed and was later seen by Wolverine lying still on his back with his eyes open, a blood stain around his carbonadium pacemaker, and flies crawling on his face.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #32 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akihiro''', codename '''Daken'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron, Jason]] (w), [[Guedes, Renato]] (p). &quot;Wolverine Goes to Hell&quot;, ''Wolverine'' (vol 4). #1 (September 2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fiction]]al character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Daken is the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] son of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and his deceased wife [[Itsu (comics)|Itsu]]. He possesses superhuman abilities similar to his father (e.g., [[healing factor]], retractable claws), and was a member of the [[Dark Avengers]] under the name '''Wolverine''' until the conclusion of the 2010 storyline, &quot;[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]&quot;.  Daken was ranked sixth in Comics Alliance's &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot; list and is often recognized for his [[sex appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Andrew (February 14, 2013). [http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/02/14/comics-sexiest-male-characters/ &quot;ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602020312/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2013/02/14/comics-sexiest-male-characters/ |date=2013-06-02 }}. [[ComicsAlliance]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Daken first appeared in ''Wolverine Origins'' #10 (March 2007), created by writer [[Daniel Way]] and artist [[Steve Dillon]]. He becomes a member of the [[Dark Avengers]], as part of the 2008–2009 &quot;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&quot; storyline, taking the role of his father.&lt;ref name=osbsupda&gt;{{cite web |first= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19654 |title=The Osborn Supremacy: Dark Avengers |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character also becomes the lead in the ''Wolverine'' series, which becomes ''Dark Wolverine'' in issue #75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=19880 |title=NYCC: Way and Liu Talk ''Dark Wolverine'' |publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020907-Dark-WOlverine.html NYCC '09 - Way &amp; Liu on 'Dark Wolverine'], [[Newsarama]], February 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Bendis]], writer of ''Dark Avengers'' has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Daken is one of the best things to come out of 'Origins,' and what better way to piss off his father? He's an iconic and legacy character attached to a number of cool things in the Marvel Universe, but he really hasn't had a lot of face time with it. So we can really roll up our sleeves and see what we've got there and help create a character.&lt;ref name=osbsupda /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of the team he is also a part of the story ''[[Dark X-Men|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia]]''.&lt;ref name=cbr21488&gt;{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21488 |title=IRON PATRIOTISM: Daken |publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared as a regular character in the ''Dark Avengers'' series from issue #1 (March 2009) through issue #16 (June 2010).

''Dark Wolverine'' continued after the end of &quot;Dark Reign&quot; and finished with issue #90 with the prelude for the &quot;Empire&quot; storyline, that continued in the new series ''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #1. Writer [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]] took over the series in 2011, starting with issue #9.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/rob-williams-daken-dark-wolverine-110302.html |title=Rob Williams Takes Over DAKEN - And Takes Him to LA |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=32409 |title=Rob Williams Is Rockin' With &quot;Daken&quot; |publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, it was announced that ''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' would be coming to a close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Alonso, Axel]]|title=Strengthening Marvel's Secondary Lines|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=35553|date=November 18, 2011|publisher=CBR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series ended with issue #23.

===Sexual orientation===
Daken has been portrayed as bisexual, having engaged in sexual situations with both men and women. Daken kissed a man in ''Wolverine: Origins'' #11; however the encounter also served to further toy with a woman he had been romantically seeing and later, Daken killed the man in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;W:O#11&quot;&gt;''Wolverine: Origin'' #11. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dark Wolverine'' #75 it is vaguely suggested Daken has had a sexual encounter with a male employee of Norman Osborn, but this was also shown as a means to access top-secret files.&lt;ref name=&quot;waytalks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22141|title=Daniel Way Talks Wolverine(s)|last=Richards|first=Dave|date=2009-07-22|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same issue, Daken makes a pass at [[Mac Gargan]] however the context is ambiguous, possibly facetious.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the same issue, Daken uses his pheromones to &quot;engage&quot; a female H.A.M.M.E.R. agent. In ''Dark Avengers'' #7, Daken humorously states how he &quot;...always did like playing for both teams,&quot; a [[double entendre]] referencing bisexuality and his membership in both the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark X-Men'' #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dark Wolverine'' #76, Daken uses his pheromones in order to manipulate the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], goading him with homoerotic remarks.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #76. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Daken also made a flirtatious pass at [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] dressed as [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]],&lt;ref name=DarkWolverine#82&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #82. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and kisses him on-panel.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #84. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #5, Daken attempts to uses his pheromones during a fight against [[Hulkling]], a gay male superhero.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Daken has also been shown on numerous occasions engaging in [[heterosexual]] behavior and sleeping with female characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;W:O#11&quot;/&gt;

At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], [[Marjorie Liu]] commenting on Daken's sexuality, stated that &quot;[Daken] will do anyone and anything [to achieve his goals] and he's past that kind of identification. He's beyond it.&quot; [[Daniel Way]] added that Daken's sexuality will be addressed later on, but it's more about his personality. &quot;He's no more homosexual than he is heterosexual. It's about control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manning, Shaun|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22198|title=CCI: X-Men Panel|publisher=CBR.com|date=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Liu later confirmed Daken's bisexuality in a 2011 video interview with Newsarama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/16660-dark-wolverine-and-his-sexual-arsenal-marjorie-liu.html|title=Dark Wolverine and His Sexual Arsenal|publisher=Newsarama|date=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYMfUA-efE|title=Dark Wolverine and His Sexual Arsenal|publisher=Newsarama/YouTube|date=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
In 1946 as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is living in Jasmine Falls, Japan with his pregnant wife Itsu, [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] sends the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] to kill Itsu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Way, Daniel]], [[Liu, Marjorie]] (w). ''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' # 1 (September 2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Itsu's death, a mysterious man cuts baby Daken from his mother's womb leaving her body lying on the floor. Daken survives this incident due to his mutant [[healing factor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #6. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime in the year 1946, Daken is placed at the doorstep of Akihira and Natsumi, a wealthy young and traditional Japanese couple. They take his presence as an answer to their prayers and raise him as their own. Though he is named Akihiro by his father, the servants and other families of the province secretly refer to him as Daken ({{lang|ja|駄犬}}, &quot;bastard dog&quot; or &quot;mongrel&quot;), a slur on his obvious mixed heritage. As Akihiro grows, he is often teased by the other boys of the village. His harsh treatment over the years causes Akihiro to develop a very cold personality, directed at everyone except his father. One night, Natsumi confesses to Akihira that she does not love their adopted son and that, after long years of trying, she is pregnant. Akihiro overhears the talk and begins plotting. Within a year, after the birth of the baby, Akihiro confronts his mother and tells her that he has killed her son. Upon learning this, Akihira is furious and disowns Akihiro, who angrily responds that &quot;Akihiro&quot; is not his true name anyway. Natsumi suddenly appears and tries to run him through, triggering the unsheathing of his mutant claws. He waves his arm, accidentally slashing Natsumi. Akihira, unable to force himself to harm his son, commits suicide. Romulus then appears to the boy for the first time and tells him that he is what the boy will someday become.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolverine 2008&quot;&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #26 (Aug. 2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present, Daken disguises himself as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and infiltrates a facility where his father is imprisoned. He stabs [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and confronts his father for the first time. He slashes Logan across the stomach and leaves him to bleed on the floor, just as his mother was left many years before.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #10. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Daken is revealed to have &quot;aided&quot; his father's escape, though not for benevolent reasons.

He is next seen in Berlin at the home of a woman with whom he has been cruelly, and romantically, toying. He allowed her to witness him kissing another man on a date, although unbeknownst to her, he later murdered the man to acquire a passport. Knowing that she would drink an entire bottle of burgundy, he secretly poisons it, resulting in her death. He had to end the relationship and her life so that no loose ends could be left to tie him to his crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;W:O#11&quot;/&gt;

While still in Germany, Daken is then contacted by an anonymous messenger who reminds him of his displeased master's &quot;ultimate goal&quot;. Daken then dispatches the messenger to again make sure no trace of his presence is left. Later he appears on a train to Brussels, watching his father in a nearby stolen car. He then receives a phone call from an unknown &quot;friend&quot; (who is actually the resurrected [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]]), confirming his father's destination.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadowing his father into a bank vault in Brussels that contains the [[carbonadium synthesizer]], Daken engages Wolverine in a bloody battle with Daken demonstrating great fighting prowess and similar speed and agility to his father. As Wolverine is hampered by his lack of desire to kill his son and his fading belief that Daken can be redeemed, he quickly loses the upper hand despite his greater experience and training. Their fight is interrupted when Cyber breaks into the vault and challenges Daken.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #13. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; It is then revealed that Daken trained under Cyber in the past. Cyber mentions that Daken is a better and faster fighter than he is, and was his finest student. However, Cyber's imperviousness and greater strength make that a moot point, as he later explains to Wolverine. Daken refuses to lead Cyber to his master and flees the fight, leaving his father and his mentor to deal with each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #14. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken is then seen in the presence of [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and a scarred, expressionless torturer who whips him with a gasoline soaked length of rope. He pleads for mercy, but receives only a warning from his &quot;master&quot; to stay away from his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #15. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken returns and fights [[Deadpool]] and Wolverine, managing to knock Deadpool unconscious after a long fight. Daken had spent the last couple of months being tortured under observation by Wild Child, who is acting on orders from their mutual master, [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #21. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Daken is then confronted by Wolverine, only to be shot in the back of the head by [[Bucky Barnes#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]. Wolverine explains that he set up the entire scenario and leaves with the unconscious Daken, later revealed to have amnesia due to the bullet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolverine 2008&quot;/&gt;

During the 2008 storyline &quot;[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny|Manifest Destiny]]&quot;, Daken is tracked down by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and [[Mister Sinister]] to help Daken regain his memories. In the finale of ''Original Sin'', Daken finally learns the truth behind Itsu's death and has joined Wolverine in seeking revenge against Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #30. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Daken seemingly betrays Wolverine to Cyber afterward. It was later revealed it was all a plan to get to Cyber's secrets. After learning them, Daken apparently kills Cyber, leaving his body to Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #32. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During a conversation between Wolverine and [[Nick Fury]], Fury reveals that he believes Daken is going after the [[Muramasa|Muramasa Blade]] that Wolverine left in [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' care. The sword has various mystical properties, including the ability to disable superhuman regenerative powers. Fury believes that Daken intends to take the sword and have the metal bonded to his bone claws after stating that the [[Tinkerer]] would know how to do such a thing and had last been spotted in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' (vol. 3) #55 (September 2007). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008–2009 &quot;[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]&quot; storyline, [[Norman Osborn]] puts together a new group of [[Dark Avengers|Avengers]], recruiting Daken as his own Wolverine, letting him wear a version of his father's brown and tan costume. Cyclops sees him as a liability and plans to kill him with the Muramasa Blade to protect the image of the [[X-Men]]. It is revealed, however, that he agreed to join the Dark Avengers as a way to draw out Cyclops to take the Muramasa Blade from his possession. When the X-Men attack him, he takes a piece of the blade and brings it to the Tinkerer, who then bonds the metal to the claws on his wrists. After that, he is seen alongside the other Dark Avengers fighting [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morganna le Fay]]'s demons.

When [[Spider-Man]] enters Avengers Tower pretending to be [[Mac Gargan]], he is first ambushed by Daken who knew he was not Mac via scent. However, he is eventually incapacitated by Spider-Man after being pummeled and thrown into an electric generator.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;American Son Part 3&quot;, ''Amazing Spiderman'' #597. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'', Daken and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] are sent by Norman Osborn to kill Mac Gargan. However, he is beaten badly by Gargan, throws him through a building.

In ''Dark Reign: The List – Punisher'' after repeated failed attempts to kill [[Punisher|Frank Castle]], [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] sends Daken and a [[platoon]] of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] troops to complete this mission. After a bloody round of [[hand-to-hand combat]], Daken [[dismember]]s and [[decapitate]]s Castle, before kicking his remains from a rooftop. Castle's body parts are collected and spirited away by [[Moloids]] seemingly operating under the protection of [[Man-Thing]], where Castle's body is put back together and revived as Franken-Castle.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: The List: The Punisher'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #603, [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] lures his son [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] into a fight between him and Daken. Daken uses his pheromones to calm Skaar down, reducing him to his human form. Skaar then asks Daken to kill, him as he was guilty of the destruction he has caused, but Wolverine and Banner intervene. The two father-son teams battle, but the fight is stopped when Banner says that Skaar has learned his lesson and Daken abruptly leaves Wolverine behind.

Daken becomes a member of Osborn's [[Dark X-Men]],{{issue|date=March 2017}} while remaining on the Dark Avengers team, though he takes the Dark X-Men's side in their quarrel with the Dark Avengers. When Bullseye asks him which side he was on, he replies that he &quot;always did like playing for both teams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #7. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Daken's loyalty to Osborn and true motives remain questionable, as Daken constantly mentions that &quot;Osborn thinks I'm working for him&quot;. This puts him at odds with Bullseye and [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. He secretly assists the [[Fantastic Four]] in helping them break into [[Avengers Tower]] to steal incriminating evidence against Osborn while trying to clear their name against Osborn, but was foiled by Bullseye.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #77. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] tried to psychoanalyze him and assuage her feelings for him, but Daken rebuked her and Osborn.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' #81. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Osborn brought his Avengers to bear against the dispossessed [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] and their &quot;Olympus Group&quot; shell corporation, Daken encounters the god [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] and received from him a prophecy of Daken's own impending death: &quot;. . .sooner than you think. And it will be bloody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' #128. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Norman Osborn's [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], it is revealed that Daken intended to turn on Osborn.&lt;ref name=DarkWolverine#82/&gt; He appears to murder him, but this was later revealed to be a hallucination caused by the Asgardian divinities who represent fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #83. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Daken attempts to fight [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who strikes him down with a massive bolt of lightning before the two can even face off.&lt;ref&gt;''Siege'' #2. Marvel Comics. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Siege ends with the Void's death, Osborn's Avengers are rounded up and arrested. Daken is the only one to escape, doing so by killing and disguising himself as an army soldier.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #16. Marvel Comics. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken turns on Romulus because he figures out that Romulus really wanted Wolverine to take over his operation and not Daken. Daken stabs Romulus with his wrist-claws, but before he can deliver the killing blow, Wolverine has [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] teleport Romulus to the Dark Force dimension. Logan thinks about simply beheading Romulus as he did with [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], but instead decides to leave him stranded forever.

He then goes back to Daken. They start to fight, but Logan stays calm. He parries Daken's angry attacks, then stabs him through with his claws. While Daken is unconscious, Logan rips out his Muramasa wrist claws. He then buries the claws with the remains of the Muramasa Blade in a grave near the Howlett estate, and Daken is shown with scars running up the insides of his forearms.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #48. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken, later seen at a nightclub, is attacked by the now monstrous [[Punisher]] (now known as Franken-Castle), who is seeking revenge. After a brutal fight, Daken is defeated but decides to hunt Franken-Castle to continue the fight and retrieve the [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] integrated into Fraken-Castle's new physical form.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #88. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After following Franken-Castle's trail, Daken encounters a series of devastating traps before meeting his foe again. After a second brutal hand-to-hand battle, Daken is severely injured and retreats. Franken-Castle finds him and, after damaging Daken even more, is about to throw him into a mass of concrete foundation (presumably to kill him). However, Franken-Castle is stabbed in the chest from behind by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who states he is intervening in his plans to kill his son.&lt;ref&gt;''Franken-Castle'' #19. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Escaping as the two fight, Daken gains the upper hand by incapacitating the Punisher (ramming him with a truck) and takes the Bloodstone, giving him increased strength and speed.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #89. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; It unfortunately accelerated his healing factor, which would create tumors after healing him. He is ultimately defeated when the Punisher shoves a phosphorus grenade into his chest, turning him into a tumor ridden monstrosity, simultaneously informing Daken that his attempts to taunt him failed because Punisher built his own reputation from the ground up while Daken is riding his father's reputation rather than trying to create his own. Wolverine removes the stone and returns it to Frank, but before Frank can give the coup de grace, Daken cuts himself out of the tumor mass and disappears.&lt;ref&gt;''Franken-Castle'' #20. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken has a brief alliance with [[X-23]], the female clone of his father. They confront the murderous Malcolm Colcord, the former director of Weapon X.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

In the aftermath of the storyline &quot;Collision&quot; Daken is &quot;cleaning up house&quot; in Madripoor by either getting the rest of the criminal underworld to agree to serve him, or eradicating his enemies. A man named Tan Kim Seng falls into the latter category. Daken kills all of Tan's finest killers, leaving only a British entrepreneur named Hunt and Tan left cornered in his office. Tan is having a final drink as Daken breaks into the room. Tan states that he only trades with business men, not &quot;Awun&quot;, which is Taiwanese for God of Destruction. Tan states that he knows that Daken is Patch's (aka Wolverine) son, and when he looks in Daken's eyes he tells him that his soul is gone. He berates Daken further by comparing him to his father Wolverine. This ultimately leads to his demise by a gunshot to his forehead. Tan's final words weigh heavy in Daken's mind later throughout the night. Daken decides to pay a visit to the Avenger's Tower. He sets up a scenario that makes it look like the Avenger's Tower is under attack. Wolverine picks up on Daken's scent and is ambushed by Daken. Daken states that he knew what Wolverine was planning by having the team split up so no harm would come to them. Daken lets Wolverine know that he did not come to kill him, but to say that he was going be missing for a while, and is going to live outside of Wolverine's shadow. Wolverine questions what he meant, but when Wolverine turns around, Daken is gone. Daken having a vast amount of money from his exploits in Madripoor, decides to start a new empire in the city of Los Angeles. He enters an expensive house that belonged to a previous couple that is lying dead on the steps at the entrance of the home. Daken looks at a marvelous view of Los Angeles and narrates to himself that he is not going to destroy, but create.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Wolverine'' #9.1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story starts off with Daken wearing a Captain America mask, and is trying to pull off an &quot;Italian Job&quot; on the Los Angeles interstate 110 but is caught in a battle with the military. Daken makes it to the armored car, but begins to suffer withdrawal symptoms from a drug called &quot;Heat&quot;. Daken promised himself that he would not take the drug before the heist, but decides to take it anyway. Immediately after the drug is taken, he begins to hallucinate very heavily during the heist.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Seven days earlier, Daken is at a party in Hollywood with actors, directors, musicians, agents, executives, and beautiful women. Despite the lavish ambiance, Daken is extremely bored with the Hollywood facade. Daken's true motive for being at the party is to find a lead to who secretly controls Hollywood so he can take over. He was under the impression that Los Angeles was wide open due to &quot;[[The Pride (comics)|The Pride]]&quot; losing control of the city. Daken was told by his fixer that the owner of the house and host of the party Marcus Roston, who also happens to be on Hollywood's A-List, has information as to who is pulling the strings in Hollywood. As Daken attempts to enter Roston's section, he is blocked by two bodyguards. Daken attempts to talk with one of them saying that he has a big deal. He is immediately disparaged by one of the guards. This causes Daken to attack him and break his nose. Immediately Daken is feeling the effects of the drug &quot;Heat&quot; and is disoriented even though his healing factor should have stopped it. He is knocked unconscious by the other bodyguard.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

In an undisclosed part of Los Angeles, there is an up-and-coming actor who is being chased by some kind of serial killer. The actor is murdered during the night. The next day, the LAPD is investigating the crime scene. Two detectives are making jokes when one of them warns the other of &quot;[[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]&quot; approaching the scene. This happens to be F.B.I. agent Donna Kiel. Donna lets the detectives know as she is investigating the crime scene that she understands the not-so-subliminal joke, because she is ice cold like the witch in the children's story.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Daken regains consciousness in front of the two bodyguards and Marcus Roston himself. Daken is surprised about the pills. Marcus confirms that he knows about them. He also berates Daken, stating that he is not a big deal due to the fact that he does not know him. As he threatens him, Daken dispatches his guards. Marcus attempts to bargain with Daken. Daken tells him that he not only wants money, but he also wants power and validation. Marcus pleads with him, saying that he will do anything for his life to be spared. Daken grabs Marcus by his head, engages in a kiss and seduces the celebrity. Daken only did this to suit his needs, get connections to who is controlling the Los Angeles underworld and to gain access to more of &quot;The Heat&quot;.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

F.B.I. agent Donna Kiel confirms the identity of the victim of the serial killer, making a snide remark about one less actor in Hollywood. The victim was killed by wounds caused by claws. She walks back to her office and it shows numerous pictures of Daken on her wall, indicating that Daken is considered a prime suspect for the serial killings.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Six days earlier, Daken and Marcus are watching a final cut from an upcoming movie that Marcus is starring in. Daken tells him that he feels the movie is simplistic. Marcus explains to Daken that the audience loves things that are simple. He does wish to do an indie film which is more personal, but he has to strike while his fame is on the rise as a leading man in movies. Daken insults Marcus by suggesting that he should be a queen. Marcus replies that if he comes &quot;out of the closet&quot; his acting career will suffer, and he says that if Daken cannot understand that, he does not understand the movie business. Daken shows his claws and threatens Marcus to tell him his dealer of the &quot;heat pills&quot;. Marcus asks Daken why he loves the pills so much.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Daken goes into a narration to the reader about the pills. As Daken is narrating, there are scenes of him in a state of euphoria as he meets up with Marcus's dealer, and shoots him twice in the thighs. The dealer gives up his supplier as Daken cuts him with his claws. Daken also states the supplier psychically told him the location of where the Los Angeles crime bosses are holding a secret meeting. Daken then goes to the nightclub where the dealer's supplier is enjoying a night out, and the situation worsens, but Daken does not care, because he loves the euphoria of the &quot;heat pills&quot;.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

During an investigation, Daken has a confrontation with the hero [[Moon Knight]] before he can discover the identity of the mysterious kingpin of Los Angeles.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

A beaten up and broken Daken discovers the properties of the heat pills are from non-human blood, confirming his suspicions that the blood belongs to a member of [[Pride (comics)|the Pride]]. An angry Daken wonders how to kill a member of the Pride but realizes he does not know, so he seeks out the people who do - their children, [[Runaways (comics)|the Runaways]]. The Runaways, however, do not take lightly to his appearance and immediately attack him.&lt;ref&gt;''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #17. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Daken manages to talk them down, and reveals that he believes Roston to be an exiled member of The Pride. Chase confirms that he recognizes Roston as &quot;Uncle Eli&quot;, a distant relative he had not seen in some time. Daken asks the Runaways to prepare to fight while he tracks down Roston.&lt;ref&gt;''Daken: Dark Wolverine #18''. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daken meets Donna Kiel at a restaurant. Daken, attempting to make a joke, is stopped by a distressed and perturbed Donna. Donna forces Daken to admit why they are meeting, but Daken does not. An impatient Donna states to him that they were meeting up to find out if they are going to fall in love. Donna then calls him a coward, and a scared little boy due to him not saying this. Those comments anger Daken to the point of grabbing Donna and popping out his claws. Donna states that she was not part of the super hero, mutant, and clone club, and offered Daken a chance to admit who he truly is. She tells him that she is smart and Daken cannot hide himself from her. She says she does not want to be a cliché and wants to be real. Daken and Donna the share a long passionate kiss, before Donna stops the embrace. Daken questions why, and she tells him that he is a murderer, cop killer, and a monster. Daken laughs hysterically and then is smacked. Daken admits that this is who he is and has no compunctions regarding murder and sleeps well at night. Donna screams at him saying that he was not capable of feeling love, and just because they were both tortured by Roston and shared an addiction does not mean they should be together. She questions how she could ever fall in love with a man like that. Daken replies that she is the same as him. She denies this, saying that she has never killed anyone. Daken insists that Donna comes with him, so he can help her. He takes her to an underground basement. To Donna's surprise, she sees three men that are tied up and look like they have been tortured. Donna states that she is F.B.I. and that he is out of his mind. Daken says that she rationalizes her psychotic tendencies by catching other psychopaths. He gives her a gun and attempts to convince her to pull the trigger so she can release her repressed emotions and be free. Donna admits to Daken that this is true. Daken does achieve this goal, but not to the desired effect, as she points the gun towards Daken. She knows his healing factor is gone, and he can be killed. Before she can arrest him, Daken cuts off her hand in defense. Daken, in disbelief, asks her why she would do that. She replies that the world is better off without him. Daken covers her wound saying that she does not mean that, because she came back to save him and no one has ever done that for him. She says that she did not come back for him, but she was trying to stop a monster. Daken, in disbelief, turns and walks away after being rejected. As he enters the elevator, he makes a final attempt to gain her love by saying that he will change. She simply responds with &quot;No you won't.&quot; Donna later walks to towards a police car asking for medical assistance. Daken had come to Los Angeles to build his empire, but after being rejected, lost his sense of self, purpose, and drive.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

Daken seeks out Mister Fantastic who informs him that the Heat pills have destroyed his healing factor which will result in his death. He advises they could study Wolverine's healing factor to help but Daken refuses. Daken finds his father and doses him with Heat and sets off a chain of events that will bring his story to a brutal end. Daken went to Los Angeles to build something for himself. There, he tried to take over the city's criminal underworld becoming L.A.'s Kingpin. During his mission he meets and falls in love with FBI agent Donna Kiel, who shared some of the traits that made Daken unique. But he was rejected by her, and cut her arms.{{issue|date=June 2012}}

After months of trying, he fails at becoming the head of the underworld in Los Angeles, and he is defeated using the powerful drug Heat, which gave him hallucinations and burned down his healing factor. Dying, he returned to New York to &quot;go out with a bang&quot;, drugging his father and taking him to watch his &quot;show&quot;. He bombed the headquarters of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the Fantastic Four, installed bombs around the city and drugged and easily subdued [[Mister Fantastic]]. After a long battle with the heroes of the city and without a healing factor, he started to die. Daken asked for his father, hugged him and asked him to forgive him. But before Logan could say anything, Daken said he was actually sorry for putting a bomb at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and immolated himself with a bomb, leaving no body to bury. Wolverine rushed to his school to find nothing but a little doll of him, realizing that Daken's plan was just to leave him with nothing.&lt;ref&gt;''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #21. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it has yet to be disclosed how Daken turns up alive, he is revealed to be the secret mastermind behind the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] (consisting of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Shadow King]], Skinless Man, the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] from [[Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]], and the [[Omega Red|Omega Clan]]) in a plot to attack the members of [[X-Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force #27. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolverine and Daken face off in an emotionally charged battle. During the fight, there are flashes of how Daken wished his life had played out with Wolverine like living happily together with Daken's mother Itsu. Daken finally meets his end when his father drowns him. Wolverine tells Daken that he blames himself and wishes he could have protected Daken more. The issue ends with Wolverine imagining the happy life they could have had.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #34 (November 2012). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apocalypse Twins]] later resurrect Daken through the use of a [[Celestials|Celestial]] Death Seed, and make him part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen of Death]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #9 (June 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He sends a worm creature to capture Wolverine, and confronts his father when the creature returns with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #10 (September 2013). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Twins are defeated, Daken escapes with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. He expresses shock at having returned to the realm of the living and states that despite having failed to kill Logan yet again, at least the sun rise the following day.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' #22. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time after the events of his fathers death Daken resurfaces at an auction house in Madripoor, where two of his fathers claw's are being sold to the highest bidder. Daken proceeds to tell all present that he will not allow anyone to dishonor his father and whoever does so will be eliminated. After retrieving his father's claws Daken proceeds to kill all of the bidders present with the exception of one undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.{{issue|date=July 2016}}

==Alternate versions==
In ''[[What If? Wolverine: Father]]'' #1, Logan was present when Daken was born and was able to save him from the people who would have raised him in the original course of events, taking him to live in seclusion in the mountains in the hope that he could raise '''John Howlett''' (as Daken is known in this timeline) away from the kind of life he has lived himself. However, despite his attempts to ensure privacy by turning Professor X away when he came to recruit Logan to join the X-Men, Logan's attempts to suppress Daken's darker instincts failed when Sabretooth found them, revealing the truth about his father's past to John. Leaving his father, John became a brutal killer, roaming various cities and killing his opponents, proclaiming that Logan made him what he is by denying him his heritage. Concluding that he will never bring anything good into the world, Logan stabs John in the heart with the Muramasa Blade, subsequently impaling himself to end his own dark stain on the world.&lt;ref&gt;''What If?

'''Silvio Manfred Dante''', played by [[Steven Van Zandt]], is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[The Sopranos]]''. He is the [[consigliere]] to [[Tony Soprano]] in the [[Soprano crime family]]. He is usually a behind the scenes figure and tries not to draw much attention to himself. He does very well at maintaining a legitimate business image as the manager and owner of the [[Bada Bing]] strip club. Silvio usually keeps his cool in even the worst situations but has been known to unleash his terrible fury and excessive anger when necessary (or when playing poker), revealing a temper comparable to his peers'. Silvio is a movie and film connoisseur and has an encyclopedic mind for movie lines. Throughout the series, he entertains the other family members by request with lukewarm Godfather impressions, mimicking [[Michael Corleone]]'s remark in the ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'': &quot;Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in.&quot; Silvio is one of the most loyal mobsters in the Soprano crime family. He is notorious on the show for executing FBI [[informant]]s and traitors.

==Plot details==
{{plot|Character|date=September 2015}}
According to ''The Sopranos, A Family History'', Silvio was born in June 1957; his father was Joseph &quot;Beppo&quot; Dante ([[Calabria]]n origin), a soldier who was &quot;gunned down&quot; in 1959. Silvio was a childhood friend of Tony and his early criminal activity often involved Tony, [[Ralph Cifaretto]] and [[Jackie Aprile, Sr.]] His original career plan was to be a professional singer, but this dream never materialized. Despite this, Silvio has maintained a connection to show business through ownership of numerous clubs in North Jersey over the years, and in backing aspiring young starlets who come up through his clubs. Silvio's support was instrumental in ensuring Tony took over as [[Caporegime|capo]] following the death of [[Johnny Boy Soprano|his father]]. Throughout his association with the Soprano crew, Silvio formed friendships with [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero]] and [[Paulie Gualtieri|Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri]].

It was Silvio who reported to Tony that his [[Uncle Junior]] planned to murder [[Pussy Malanga]] in [[Artie Bucco]]'s restaurant and who was later entrusted with starting the fire which would ensure the original Vesuvio's burnt down, therefore not ruining its reputation. In the short and bloody war of 1999 with the Junior Soprano crew, Silvio helped Tony to plan hits on [[Chucky Signore]] and [[Mikey Palmice]] and remained supportive when his friend revealed that he had been seeing a therapist. Silvio is one of the more level-headed associates of Tony Soprano. Where many of Tony's men immediately become hot-headed and resort to violence, Silvio generally helps to mediate many situations and gets along with everyone. He accompanies Tony to most of his &quot;sit-downs&quot; - a formal venue in the organization to resolve disputes. Because of this, Tony relies on Silvio to be a clear-headed thinker and someone he can trust. Silvio is most often the one to quote mafia rules and norms when a tough decision is to be made, even if he ends up disagreeing with Tony. Silvio's move to consigliere, once Tony becomes acting boss, seems completely natural. Indeed, Silvio remains Tony's most reliable adviser and enforcer, with only several incidents that show his aggression, such as when [[Fat Dom Gamiello]] makes a remark about the late [[Vito Spatafore]] (and implying that [[Carlo Gervasi]] was gay), an enraged Silvio attacked Fat Dom by hitting him in the back of the head with a handheld vacuum, and then holding his arms behind his back, which leads Carlo to stab Dom repeatedly in the abdomen with a large kitchen knife, and during poker, when he often becomes foul-mouthed and paranoid. 

Silvio's criminal interests include [[loan shark]]ing and [[bookmaking]] but his day-to-day role is that of managing the Bada Bing, the most recent in a string of [[strip club]]s that he has operated. &quot;The Bing&quot;, as it is often referred to, is not only one of the crime family's major meeting spots, but also doubles as a [[brothel]]. The most notable instance of Silvio's club's doubling as a house of [[procuring (prostitution)|prostitution]] is perhaps episode  &quot;[[University (The Sopranos episode)|University]]&quot;, wherein Silvio's role in this arrangement is especially poignant. In spite of his [[misogyny]], Silvio loves and cares about, and is a strong father for his teenage daughter Heather, whom he calls ''The Principessa''. Silvio says that Heather disapproves of his profession calling it &quot;degrading to women&quot;. Tony has said to him, &quot;You're a good father.&quot; When his daughter's soccer coach was found to be involved with one of his young players, Silvio looked for vengeance but followed Tony's decision to let the authorities deal with him. Apart from periodic instances of adultery, Christopher says during his intervention that Silvio was &quot;fucking every slut you got working in the place&quot;, it can be said that he also loves his wife, [[Gabriella Dante]] (played by [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s real life wife [[Maureen Van Zandt]]), very much. 

Silvio has a long record of executing traitors throughout the show. He killed [[James Altieri|Jimmy Altieri]] at the end of season one. Later, along with Tony and [[Paulie Gualtieri]], he executes [[Big Pussy Bonpensiero|Pussy Bonpensiero]] in season two. In season five, he executes [[Adriana La Cerva]]. All were killed when they were discovered to have been cooperating -- or, in the case of Altieri, thought to have been cooperating -- with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in their ongoing investigation of the [[Soprano crime family]]. Like Tony and Paulie, Bonpensiero's killing haunted Silvio. In Season 6, Silvio also executed [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Burt Gervasi|Burt Gervasi]], garroting him after he discovered that he had been working with the [[Lupertazzi crime family]].

Silvio's judgment wavered a little when he realized Tony was positioning [[Christopher Moltisanti]] as an intermediary between him and the rest of the organization because of Chris and Tony's blood ties. This was made most apparent when Paulie was arrested on a gun charge and Tony made Christopher acting capo of his crew in Paulie's absence. Sil responded by encouraging Gualtieri crew soldier [[Patsy Parisi]] to steal from the Esplanade construction site against Tony's and Chris' orders - creating problems for Chris. Silvio also became embroiled in a conflict over a [[Columbus Day]] celebration with Native American protesters - something Tony saw as a distraction - going so far as to get many of the family's associates involved in a violent altercation with the protesters. Silvio found it hard to let the conflict die even once Tony had exhausted all avenues of winning the dispute. Silvio did not take this uncharacteristic behavior any further and, although Tony had noticed it, nothing came of it. Silvio got a chance to vent his frustration with Christopher at an intervention for Chris' drug problem that ended with Chris' being violently put in his place by Paulie and Silvio. Since Chris returned from rehab, his relationship with Silvio seems to have returned to their previous friendly association.

Silvio maintains a realistic relationship with Paulie Gualtieri, well aware of Paulie's tight-fisted attitude towards money and dangerous tendencies. Silvio has remarked to Tony that they know that Paulie does not kick up his full tribute. Silvio also tried to warn Paulie that his distractedness had been noticed at the time when Paulie let his loyalties waver towards the Lupertazzi crime family, not long after Silvio's own crisis of faith in Tony. Paulie and Silvio argued about this - Paulie had been harboring resentment toward Silvio since an illness got Paulie into the ''[[Pine Barrens (The Sopranos)|Pine Barrens]]'' fiasco, while making Silvio's rounds. However, it was not long before Paulie returned his attention to staying in Tony's good graces. 

Silvio counseled Tony through difficult decisions about [[Richie Aprile]], and his disputes with [[Ralph Cifaretto]], [[Feech La Manna]] and [[Tony Blundetto]]. He is often forced to convince Tony to go against his impulses - something that he usually manages without setting off Tony's hair-trigger temper. More often than not, when Silvio has something on his mind but won't speak it, Tony often senses this and gets him to speak up. 

When Tony ends up in a [[coma]] after being shot by his uncle in a fit of dementia, it falls upon Silvio to take the reins as acting boss of the Soprano family. At first, Silvio seemingly enjoys the job, and even feels a slight bit of regret that he did not accept an offer from the late [[Jackie Aprile, Sr.]] to become the boss back in the late 1990s. His wife Gabriella prompts him to consider the possibilities of a permanent change. His ambitions quickly subside when he feels the immense pressure of being boss and begins to have asthma attacks brought on by anxiety. As boss, Silvio dealt effectively with Paulie in a dispute over the split of profits from a heist Paulie had undertaken following a tip from [[Vito Spatafore]]. However, Silvio was indecisive in his handling of a dispute between Vito and [[Bobby Bacala]] over a collection route.

Since his return to the more comfortable role of consigliere, Silvio has again counseled Tony about contentious issues. When Vito was outed to the organization, Silvio convinced Tony of the need to restrain his desire to &quot;give him a pass&quot; because of the effect it would have on the other captains' view of his leadership. When Tony responded with distasteful jokes to Bobby's serious injury, a look from Silvio was enough to tell him he was being unfair.

When Vito Spatafore came back from New Hampshire, Silvio said that there would be popular sentiment to get rid of him, but Tony had initially decided to let Vito run a prostitution ring in Atlantic City. However, when [[Phil Leotardo]] confronted Tony about Vito being in New Jersey, Silvio and Tony both knew that they couldn't keep fighting with Phil over the issue and that if they wanted to keep the &quot;no show&quot; jobs, Vito would have to go. Silvio had always pushed for Spatafore to be taken care of and told Tony that it was the right move and not to beat himself up over the issue.

When Phil Leotardo and his men killed Vito (without permission from Tony), Tony told Silvio that it wasn't about Vito, it was about him. Silvio initially told Tony that they should go after one of Phil's men but Tony was trying to avoid a war and instead decided to blow up Phil's wire room in Sheepshead Bay.

Silvio and Carlo were at [[Satriale's Pork Store]] later that day when &quot;Fat Dom&quot; Gamiello came by. Dom started making jokes about Vito's homosexuality and implied that Carlo was homosexual. Silvio told Dom to leave, but when Dom continued his ridicule, anger got the best of the usually calm consigliere as he smashed his hand-held vacuum over Dom's head and held him while Carlo stabbed him to death. A short time afterwards, Tony came by the shop to see them. Silvio advised Tony not to enter, but he couldn't stop Tony from finding Dom. Tony stormed out of the shop with Silvio right behind him telling Tony that &quot;When you kill a [[made man|made guy]], this is what happens.&quot;

In the episode &quot;[[Stage 5 (The Sopranos episode)|Stage 5]]&quot; Silvio was out at lunch with Gerry Torciano, the man Phil Leotardo wanted to take over as boss of the Lupertazzi family, when one of Doc Santoro's assassins killed Torciano. This outraged Tony, as Silvio could have been hurt during that altercation.  

In the episode &quot;[[The Blue Comet]]&quot;, it is revealed that the Lupertazzi family has recruited Burt Gervasi to begin a rebellion against Tony. Burt goes to Silvio to join in a coup d'état against the boss, but Silvio responds by strangling him to death at his home a short time later. Eventually assassination plots are put on Silvio, [[Bobby Bacala]], and [[Tony Soprano]] in order to decapitate the leadership of the family. Shortly after Bobby is killed, while [[Patsy Parisi]] drives Silvio outside of the Bada Bing club, a car moves in front of them, with two men coming out shooting multiple times.  Silvio tries taking a pistol off of the back seat, only to be shot in the back. Silvio manages to grab his pistol in time while Parisi holds them off. Parisi manages to defend them, but soon the two men begin to target Silvio more. He is shot once more in the chest, while Patsy runs into the woods, fleeing for his life. Afterwards, Silvio is rushed to the hospital and placed in an intensive care unit.

Paulie later tells Tony that Silvio survived the assassination attempt but is in a coma; the doctors say that he is unlikely to regain consciousness. In the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final episode]], an emotional Tony visits the still comatose Silvio, whose fate is not mentioned further.

'''Ernest Darby''' is a fictional character on the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'', played by [[Mitch Pileggi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=40843 Hunnam, Glenn and Sagal in FX's Anarchy]&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the show's early antagonists and is the leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]], a [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[drug dealing]] street gang.

==Biography==
Darby is the leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]], a [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[street gang]] who deal in [[methamphetamine]], and lives in a large [[suburban]] home in [[Charming, California|Charming]], [[Northern California]]. It is indicated that he had a prior romantic interest in [[Gemma Teller Morrow]], despite her being of partial [[Jew]]ish heritage and the wife of [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club|Sons of Anarchy]] leader [[Clay Morrow]]. He also served a prison sentence in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], before his release in 2008. As a legitimate business, he operates a finishing business in Charming, where he employs minorities despite his white supremacy views.

He has a number of tattoos, most notably a [[Swastika]] and the word 'NORDICS' in the center of his chest.

===Season One===
Ernest Darby was recently released from [[California Institution for Men|Chino]] at the beginning of the first season. He was called to a meeting with [[Clay Morrow]] and [[Jax Teller]], the leaders of the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club|Sons of Anarchy]], after Teller found out that his ex-wife had been buying [[methamphetamine]] from a Nord in town. The SOA warned him not to sell drugs in [[Charming, California|Charming]], and also gave him a [[pistol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Pilot/episode/1213971/recap.html Pilot - Recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912120123/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Pilot/episode/1213971/recap.html |date=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then contacted [[Marcus Álvarez]], the leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Mayans|Mayans]] whom he met in prison. He proposed that they team up to take out the Sons of Anarchy because the Nords want to sell meth in Charming but are unable to because of the SOA, and the SOA sell weapons to the Mayans' rivals. Álvarez refused the offer, but did give his backing by offering Mayan security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Seeds/episode/1213972/recap.html Seeds - Recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914045811/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Seeds/episode/1213972/recap.html |date=September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a 13-year-old girl was raped at the local carnival, the Sons of Anarchy approached Darby and inquired if it was one of his men. He also quizzed them on what happened to Whistler, one of his soldiers who was killed by the SOA. It was also revealed in this episode that his mother was dying of cancer. Gemma kids him about his mom being treated by Jewish doctors as she sits with him at the hospital. Though he doesn't seem upset by this. Gemma and Darby seem to have dated sometimes in the past, and are still on friendly terms, despite Gemma's Jewish background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Fun+Town/episode/1228109/recap.html Fun Town - Recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316032810/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Fun+Town/episode/1228109/recap.html |date=March 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Josh Kohn]], a rogue ATF agent, sent him information on [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#True IRA|IRA]] and SOA weapon deals, he called another meeting with Álvarez. He told him to kill Clay Morrow and afterwords, the Nords could take Charming and the Mayans could take over the gun business. Marcus then told his son,  [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai Álvarez|Esai]], to kill both Morrow and Darby. Later, when Clay was making a deal with the IRA at a bar, the Mayans attacked but were killed before they could get to him. They simultaneously assaulted Darby's home, but also failed to kill him. They broke in and shot a Nord footsoldier and two women, but Darby hid and escaped death.

Darby was arrested for questioning about the shootings. He was hit by the police chief [[Wayne Unser]], after making a derisive  remark about Unser's brown wife. Clay Morrow, who was also in the station for questioning, told him not to retaliate against the Mayans because it would start a war on the streets of Charming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Hell+Followed/episode/1228115/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header Hell Followed - Recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324154004/http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/Hell+Followed/episode/1228115/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header |date=March 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Two===
In Season Two, Darby is given an envelope of money and told by AJ Weston to start a methlab in Charming specifically to antagonize SAMCRO. When Darby says that Clay will retaliate if they bring drugs into Charming, AJ gives him a note and says to call the number and let them know how much money or manpower is needed.
Darby is not as unreasonable and violent as AJ Weston and Ethan Zobelle, the leaders of the White separatist group League Of American Nationalists (L.O.A.N.), nor is he as strict with his racist beliefs (for example, Darby employs 'people of color' in his shop). AJ told Darby that he should cover up the Swastika tattoo on his chest, as, due to his dealings with non-whites, he has not &quot;earned it&quot; in AJ's eyes.  When L.O.A.N. steps up their actions against SAMCRO, Darby decides to get away from Charming for a while, not wanting to get caught up in the violence he believes will be coming to the town.

Following an attack on one of Darby's meth labs by SAMCRO, Zobelle offers him revenge by providing assistance in burning down the porn studio run by SAMCRO. During this, Darby is double-crossed by AJ, who seemingly leaves him to die in the fire. In an extended scene on the Sons of Anarchy Season Two DVD, it's revealed that Darby is alive.

===Season Three===
Darby is shown to be alive and recovering in the episode &quot;The Push.&quot;  He observes Jax and Tara dealing black market pharmaceutical meds with a local clinic.  He takes this information to Jacob Hale Jr., who is apprehensive and believes Darby is just trying to crush the competition from SAMCRO.  Darby claims that the Nords have fallen apart and that his near-death experience made him decide to lead a normal life and that now he is only looking for revenge.  Hale ultimately uses the tip and has the Sheriffs raid SAMCRO's clubhouse.  In a later episode, Hale attempts to bribe Darby into helping him run a stubborn gym owner out of a neighborhood he is looking to redevelop.  Darby initially accepts the bribe, but he is not able to convince the gym owner to vacate the property.  Darby, disgusted with himself at becoming Hale's errand boy, angrily returns the bribe money to Hale and then leaves.

===Season Six===
In retaliation for Clay Morrow's killing of a high-level Aryan Nation member in prison, a group of Neo-Nazis attack the Teller-Morrow Garage and cut up Wayne Unser's chest.  Jax and SAMCRO go to Darby, who has separated himself from the Aryan Nation and is now married to a Mexican woman, for information on where to find the Neo-Nazis.  Darby is at first hesitant to give up information on his former colleagues, but Jax is able to convince him that it will help out all parties involved as Darby himself is a marked man since he left the Aryan Brotherhood.  Darby leads Jax and his men to the home of the Neo-Nazis, but their plan of attack backfires. SAMCRO and Darby end up killing the Neo-Nazis and planting a stash of weapons (the same type of weapons used in a school shooting) in their house. After this, Darby and SAMCRO part on good terms.

'''Dark Beast''' ('''Henry Philip McCoy'''), sometimes known as the '''Black Beast''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted as an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate reality]] [[evil twin|evil]] [[doppelgänger|version]] of the [[X-Men]]'s [[Beast (comics)|Beast]].

In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, McCoy was a [[mad scientist]] who implemented cruel experiments under the tyrant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. He was one of a handful of characters to escape the Age of Apocalypse reality to [[Earth-616|the regular Marvel Universe]], where he has continued his unethical experiments.

==Publication history==
Dark Beast first appeared in ''X-Men: Alpha'' and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Roger Cruz]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate dimension he came from, Hank McCoy was a [[mad scientist]] and [[geneticist]] working for [[Mister Sinister]] in his breeding pens, intent on breeding more powerful mutants according to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot; ideology. However, while Sinister was methodical and rational in his experiments, McCoy (as ruthless as his mentor) sadistically delighted in causing pain to his lab subjects and in the cruelty of his experiments, which is why he was nicknamed the Beast both by prisoners and Sinister's Elite Mutant Force. McCoy also experimented on himself in order to further his mutation and gained his ape-like bestial appearance. Any mutant that he deemed unworthy was turned into a component of a genetic stew that was used to create Apocalypse's army of Infinites.

Besides being one of the creators of the Infinites, the Dark Beast also experimented on [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], on [[Jamie Madrox]] (thus being one of the creators of The Madri), [[Impossible Man]], merged all of the [[Power Pack|Power siblings]] into one hideous creature, created [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], made Nemesis into [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] following his defeat at the hands of Magneto, and was also responsible for the creation of Holocaust's lead hunter [[Crule|Wolverine]] (not to be confused with the X-Men's [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who was known only as Weapon X in that reality).

===Into the Main Reality===
With the end of the Age of Apocalypse, the Dark Beast was able to escape into [[Earth-616]] through the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. He was believed to have died due to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'s interference in his set trajectory. However, the only damage was that he landed twenty years in the past in the Morlock Tunnels without any memory whatsoever. He soon met a young [[Emma Frost]], who helped him to regain some of his scattered memories.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X #-1''&lt;/ref&gt; The Dark Beast was responsible for the creation of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. The characteristics of the experimentation were later recognized by the 616 Mister Sinister as an unauthorized use of his own theories, leading him to order the [[Mutant Massacre|elimination]] of the Morlocks.

===Infiltrating the X-Men===
The Dark Beast later [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the real Beast and kept him a prisoner behind a brick wall. He infiltrated the [[X-Men]] in his place by altering his appearance to match the real McCoy's fur color, although he occasionally found himself at risk of discovery due to Hank possessing a broader range of knowledge than himself, requiring him to bluff his way through some of the questions he was asked.&lt;ref&gt;X-Men Vol 2 #49&lt;/ref&gt; He helped keep up the ruse by slaying many of Hank's childhood friends and teachers, although he found himself unable to kill Hank's parents. Angered at this emotional weakness, he decapitated a pedestrian as he left town. The Dark Beast was able to keep up his ruse until the Onslaught Saga, during which the Dark Beast joined [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Onslaught had, in fact, known from the beginning of Dark Beast's ruse and mentally shielded him from other telepaths at the mansion, intending to question him about the reality of his origin. However, upon learning what happened in Dark Beast's reality when mutants ruled, Onslaught decided to destroy both races rather than helping mutants take their place as the world's rulers, only just being defeated thanks to the sacrifice of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four]].

===Gene Nation===
He also had a few run-ins with [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and [[Gene Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''X-Man'' #50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; There he was the leader of the newly revamped Gene Nation, although through the robotic body of Wynter, attempting to capture Generation X in order to experiment on them. The previous meeting between him and Emma Frost was also revealed. He also led an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].

Right before ''[[House of M]]'', the Dark Beast was in [[Genosha]] where he joined Xavier's team after being offered [[parole]]. It was confirmed in The 198 Files one-shot that he stayed powered after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

===Endangered Species===
Dark Beast returns and finally confronts his counterpart in the [[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]] storyline where he ambushes him in [[Neverland (comics)|Neverland]], the extermination camp ran by [[Weapon X]], to offer his services regarding finding a cure for M-Day. The two form an uneasy alliance to tackle the impending mutant extinction but part ways due to their drastically different moral approaches to science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard George|title=Endangered X-Men Build to Fall Event|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2007-03-18|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/773/773652p1.html|accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a trip to the Guthrie household aimed at requesting samples of DNA from the mother and father of several mutant, and non-mutant, children - the Dark Beast (without warning Henry) poisons one of the un-mutated Guthrie boys, Lewis, in a quick scientific experiment. He then carries the dying boy's body back to the house, suggesting that they should try one of the girls next. Shocked and enraged with his actions, Hank attacks the Dark Beast who, disgusted with Henry's inability to do all that is necessary to save their mutant species, beats him almost unconscious. The fight is interrupted by Mrs. Guthrie, who fires a round from a double-barrelled shotgun into Dark Beast's left shoulder. After scolding Mrs. Guthrie for thinking a round of birdshot would put him down, the Dark Beast is knocked unconscious by Henry.

===Dark X-Men===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Dark Beast later appears as a member of the [[Dark X-Men]] (a team of X-Men put together by [[Norman Osborn]]). He serves as the team's scientist.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #513&lt;/ref&gt; He constructs a device known as the &quot;Omega Machine&quot; to experiment on mutants in Alcatraz for [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and starts testing on Beast, causing him great pain and torment as it begins slowly eating him away. Osborn is not impressed with the test results of the Omega Machine and wants Dark Beast to make sure the machine works in removing powers from mutants, not killing them. Dark Beast continues to experiment with his Omega Machine, using Beast as his key test subject. Each use of the device causes Beast to look more decrepit and weak. Deciding to use a new subject to test the device on, Dark Beast goes to collect the newly captured Mindee of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #514&lt;/ref&gt; When he reaches the holding cell however, he discovers that Mindee's capture was done to allow X-Force to follow.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Beast is then attacked and stabbed multiple times by both Wolverine and Warpath.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus'' One Shot Special&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark Beast recovered quickly from his injuries suffered by the hands of Wolverine and Warpath as he was sent by Norman Osborn as well as Mimic, Weapon Omega and Mystique under Jean Grey's form, to investigate the cause of several inhabitants of a small town to dreamwalk and continuously repeat &quot;I'm an X-Man&quot;. As they investigate, both Mimic and Omega are overwhelmed by some kind of energies and go on a rampage leaving [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and Dark Beast alone with a patient that they were examining. Shortly thereafter the energies takes a humanoid form and [[Nate Grey]], best known as X-Man, once more takes physical form, much to Dark Beast's shock and horror.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark X-Men'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back to origins===
Dark Beast has since returned to the Morlock's Tunnels after the fall of Norman Osborn. He was able to capture the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and began developing a means of enhancing the Lizard's control of the reptilian parts of the human brain in order to turn human beings into humanoid lizards. Dark Beast had been abducting victims of bullying or abuse from the streets, until the X-Men and [[Spider-Man]] found his base. Dark Beast locks Spider-Man out of the room and triggers the mutation in Gambit, Storm, Emma Frost and Wolverine, although Emma comes through the 'attack' unharmed as she is in her diamond form,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 3 #9&lt;/ref&gt; giving her and Spider-Man time to escape Dark Beast's minions and release the Lizard to knock him out. Later the X-Men and Spider-Man reverse the process and take Dark Beast into custody.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 3 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Angel Saga===
While being transported, Dark Beast is approached by the Uncanny X-Force team, who wanted McCoy's help to find a cure for Archangel. As Warren succumbs to the darkness within him, Dark Beast confronted the team with the revelation that the only place left to turn for a cure is the Age of Apocalypse reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Fore'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

They arrived ten years after the X-Men had defeated [[Mister Sinister]], yet it appears that the X-Men still face enormous challenges in this harsh setting. As they follow Dark Beast, unknowingly followed by [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], to one of his labs, Dark Beast approaches one Gatekeeper, who reveals that no one has ever entered the lab after Dark Beast's disappearance. As they walk in they find a picture with Sinister, Dark Beast, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] on it, with Dark Beast mistakenly revealing that Prelate Scott Summers is also dead. Dark Beast soon finds the life seed but before he could hand it over to the X-Force members, Nightcrawler teleports in and swipes the seed away, figuring that Dark Beast was up to some evil plot. After a brief quarrel which ended with the life seed destroyed by Sunfire and Psylocke recognizing Sabretooth from her time on the Exiles, Dark Beast sneaks over to the portal back to the main Marvel Universe, Earth-616, and walks in, leaving X-Force stranded in the Age of Apocalypse world. He then released the now fully evil Dark Angel from his prison and helped him form an army to devastate Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Force'' #11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Termination===
Following the events of the Dark Angel Saga, Dark Beast has assumed command over the Clan Akkaba of Earth 616 and relocated off world alongside Ozymandias, Famine, a pregnant Pestilance, War and a badly injured Earth 295 Blob. It also appears he retrieved Sugar Man from Steve Rogers' custody, and together have rebuilt the dimensional portal technology and returned to the Age of Apocalypse where the two are using the energies of the life seed to aid Weapon Omega to resurrect a number of fallen mutants in order to provide Weapon Omega an army of powerful mutants.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Apocalypse'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

At some undisclosed time Dark Beast leaves the Age of Apocalypse and returns to Earth-616 Universe. He is soon approached by the AoA version of Nightcrawler who wants to return to their home dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Apocalypse'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Celestial Dreamer, Dark Beast once again opens a dimensional portal and returns to the Age of Apocalypse along with Nightcrawler. There he discovers Weapon Omega's defeat at the hands of the human coalition and the capture of the Apocalypse seed. However, returning to the Age of Apocalypse with the X-Men and X-Treme X-Men in tow resulted in the release of evil beings known as the Exterminators. These beings arrive from the multiverse and destroy anyone they touch.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Treme X-Men'' (vol. 2) #12&lt;/ref&gt;

The X-Men and X-Treme X-Men must vacate the Age of Apocalypse in order to imprison that reality forever. Otherwise, the Exterminators will destroy the whole multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #61&lt;/ref&gt; AoA Nightcrawler teleports them to Earth-616 one at a time and Dark Beast goes with them. Dark Beast arrives on Earth-616 but is knocked out by Gambit. After the Age of Apocalypse reality is closed forever with AoA Nightcrawler's sacrifice, Dark Beast is taken away by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Termination'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Dark Beast was soon able to escape from the authorities and was revealed to be the mastermind behind the events that lead the Uncanny X-Men and S.H.I.E.L.D. to war. He started hunting the X-Men affiliated with Cyclops by hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. using classified research sources to upgrade his work and find the X-Men. He was the one to infect Cyclops, Emma Frost, Magik, Magneto and Colossus with nano-sentinels which is the reason for their broken powers after the incident with the Phoenix Force.  Beast finally launches a coordinated attack using a hijacked SHIELD Helicarrier to launch a nuclear strike and new indestructible sentinels that have adapted to all the X-Men's powers. The only thing he didn't account for was the new X-Man [[Hijacker (comics)#David Bond|David Bond, aka Hijack]], who can control any electronic device. Dark Beast's body has been so weak after experimenting on himself, that he needed a life support suit, so after a short battle his suit was punctured and he died.&lt;ref&gt;Uncanny X-Men Volume #3 - Issue #22&lt;/ref&gt;

During the &quot;Last Days&quot; part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, it was mentioned months ago that Dark Beast was among the scientists that Magneto's right-hand person Briar tried to contact in order to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto's powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. This occurred sometime before he began suffering from his own genetic experimentations.&lt;ref&gt;''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The Dark Beast has the same [[superhuman]] abilities and intelligence as the [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe's]] [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before he underwent his secondary mutation. However, Dark Beast was not physically as powerful as his counterpart was in the normal Marvel continuity as he did not train on a regular basis, also being hampered by the fact that he is 20 years older than the main universe's Beast.

While as intelligent as his counterpart, &quot;normal&quot; Beast seems to possess a larger spectrum of knowledge, as evidenced when Dark Beast was infiltrating the X-Men and became annoyed at the amount of knowledge the X-Men expected him to possess. This is due to Dark Beast specializing in genetics, while 616 Beast maintained study in multiple fields.

==Other versions==

===Mutant X===
An alternate Dark Beast is seen in the ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species]]'' storyline alongside [[Alternative versions of Beast#Mutant X|Brute]] of the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' reality.{{issue|date=September 2012}}

==In other media==

===Video games===
* In the ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' video game, Dark Beast appears as a brainwashed Beast who believes himself to be a follower of Mister Sinister and Apocalypse. He battles the player as a boss along with Misterr Sinister. The cause of Beast's actions was the drugs created by  Mister Sinister. After being cured, Beast begins to feel guilty for his actions. Dark Beast has special dialogue with Storm.

'''Michael Dawson''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Harold Perrineau]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. Michael served as an antagonist of the second season. After losing a custody battle with [[Characters of Lost#Other recurring off-island characters|Susan Lloyd]] ([[Tamara Taylor]]), Michael does not see his son [[Walt Lloyd|Walt]] ([[Malcolm David Kelley]]) for almost ten years. They reunite when she dies, but on their journey home, their plane crashes on a mysterious island in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Here Walt is kidnapped by the Island's previous inhabitants, the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], and Michael spends his time trying to retrieve him. He is eventually successful, and they leave the Island together, but the guilt over the murders he had to commit to achieve this leads him to an estrangement with his son and a suicide attempt. He returns to the Island on a freighter, but is killed when a bomb on it explodes. Michael reappears as a ghost, and apologizes to [[Hugo Reyes|Hurley]] for killing [[Libby (Lost)|Libby]] ([[Cynthia Watros]]).

Although initially skeptical about the role, Perrineau took it after ''Lost'' creator [[J. J. Abrams]] told him more about it. Much of the [[Lost (season 1)|first season]] arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally going to be part of a [[love triangle]] with [[South Korea|Korean]] couple [[Sun-Hwa Kwon|Sun]] ([[Yunjin Kim]]) and [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in [[Lost (season 2)|season two]], Perrineau knew he would return to ''Lost'' at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.

==Arc==
Much of Michael's life before the plane crash is shown in flashbacks during &quot;[[Special (Lost)|Special]]&quot;.

'''Piter De Vries''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', but also appears in the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999–2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]].

De Vries is portrayed by [[Brad Dourif]] in [[David Lynch]]'s 1984 film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', and by Jan Unger in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|2000 ''Dune'' miniseries]].

== Character ==
In the service of the ruthless [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], De Vries is a [[Mentat]] — a human specially trained to perform mental functions rivaling computers, which are forbidden universe-wide. In addition, De Vries has been &quot;twisted&quot; into an [[Amorality|amoral]] [[Sadomasochism|sadist]] by his [[Bene Tleilax|Tleilaxu]] creators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries is so loyal to Harkonnen that he continues to serve the Baron with great enthusiasm even though his Mentat abilities and great intelligence confirm his suspicions that his master plans to eventually kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; As he says in ''Dune'':

{{quote|But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;}}

De Vries is described in the novel ''Dune'' (though not portrayed on screen) as being addicted to the drug [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], which has colored both the sclera and irises of his eyes a characteristic deep blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;

==''Dune''==
[[File:Mentat Piter DeVries.gif|thumb|left|150px|Piter De Vries from ''[[The Dune Encyclopedia]]'']]
In ''Dune'', it is established that De Vries had pioneered a type of toxin called &quot;[[residual poison]]&quot; which remains in the body for years and requires an [[antidote]] to be administered regularly. One such fatal poison is secretly administered by the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]] to [[Thufir Hawat]], the Mentat of [[House Atreides]], in order to keep Hawat's allegiance as the only provider of the antidote&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt; (in the 1984 movie version, it is shown that Hawat has to milk a gruesome captive cat for the antidote every day).

De Vries is generally regarded as architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, long-time enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet [[Arrakis]]. It was Piter's techniques and torture that broke [[Wellington Yueh]], the Atreides [[Suk School|Suk doctor]]'s Imperial Conditioning against taking a life. Yueh eventually betrays House Atreides. De Vries's reward was to have been [[Lady Jessica]], the [[concubine]] of [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]], as his slave, but he chooses instead to become governor of Arrakis. However, Yueh has given the captured Leto a false tooth containing a poisonous gas. When Leto crushes the tooth, the intended victim Baron Harkonnen escapes, but Leto and De Vries die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dune&quot;/&gt;

==''Prelude to Dune''==
In ''[[Dune: House Corrino]]'' (published in 2001 and the third novel in the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson), Piter De Vries discovers the Harkonnen heritage of [[Lady Jessica]] and her newborn son [[Paul Atreides|Paul]], and attempts to kidnap and ransom the infant. The plot is thwarted and the secret preserved — the [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] kills the Mentat and arranges for his corpse to be shipped home to [[Giedi Prime]]. An enraged Baron is left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax: the Mentat De Vries featured in Herbert's original novel ''Dune''.&lt;ref name=&quot;House Corrino&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Herbert |author2=Kevin J. Anderson |editor= |title=[[Dune: House Corrino]] |year=2001 |publisher= |isbn= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnny Dee''' ('''John D.''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He debuted in ''[[Son of M]] #1'' (2005).

==Fictional character biography==
Johnny was one of the few mutants who kept his powers after the [[Scarlet Witch]] [[Decimation (comics)|altered the world]] so that most of the world's mutants would lose their powers. Living in Mutant Town, Johnny was about to be killed by mutant-hating thugs.&lt;ref&gt;''Son of M'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; After being rescued by [[Spider-Man]], Johnny agreed to move over to the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] for his own safety. There, he became part of [[X-Men: The 198|The 198]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Member of The 198===
When [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] arrived at the school, they shared a conversation about her recent outburst. Magma saw them as friends, but Johnny began falling in love with her. Magma admitted that Johnny looked cute but was a bit disgusted by his powers. Later, Johnny appeared to use his powers to create small duplicates of the mutant Magma,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The 198'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; and later of [[Jazz (comics)|Jazz]] as well. They appear to be voodoo dolls that make the targets become under Johnny Dee's control. Jazz spied on Johnny and found him making the voodoo doll of himself. Johnny later used the doll against Jazz and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The 198'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; When the mysterious [[Mister M (comics)|Mr. M]] sought out to gain the other 198 their freedom back, Johnny Dee (at the request of O*N*E leader [[Demetrius Lazer]]) had [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] depower Mr. M, and had Magma kill him.  He then stated that he won't ask anything in return for the job. &quot;At least, not yet...&quot; and decided to remain at Xavier's for his own reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The 198'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
It is later revealed that Johnny and the creature are not the same being; he has taken to calling it &quot;the freak.&quot; Johnny doesn't consider himself a mutant, since the creature has a brain of its own. Two possibilities exist: either the creature is merely a part of Johnny's body and he is in denial of his own mutant nature, or the creature is some sort of [[parasitic twin]] who possesses mutant capabilities, while Johnny does not. In any event, Johnny continues to be a pawn in General Lazer's agenda, until Lazer is found out by [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper]] and General Reyes.  Both are incarcerated, but while Lazer is being interrogated (tortured) by Cooper (for information to unlock a door trapping most of the 198), he realizes too late that Johnny did indeed touch him, at which point, Johnny snaps the neck of the voodoo doll of Lazer, killing him.  At this point, Dee remains behind bars.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: X-Men'' #2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Johnny has an octopus-like creature coming out of his chest with several tentacles. This creature has a brain of its own but it cannot speak (but it's suggested in ''The 198'' that the latter could be false{{Issue|date=April 2009}}) and can produce 'voodoo dolls' after Johnny introduces a DNA sample of someone (like a strand of hair) in the creature's mouth. The creature spits a clamshell that contains a tiny, naked replica of the person; which allows him control the person entirely as he did with Magma and Leech.
Johnny and the creature share the same nervous system, but Johnny cannot feel the creature's pain (evidenced in ''[[Son of M]]'' #1 where one of the creature's tentacles were slashed, leaving them both on the verge of death, but Johnny was oblivious to the actual extent of the injury).

'''Delphini''' (born c. [[1998]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-CCP4-0|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;), known by the nickname '''Delphi''', was a [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the daughter of [[Tom Riddle]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Being the only child of Lord Voldemort, Delphi became the only known living heir of [[Salazar Slytherin]] after the demise of her father. Delphini was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for the murder of [[Craig Bowker Jr|Craig Bowker]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Delphini was born in secret at [[Malfoy Manor]] in the mid-to-late [[1990s]] as the result of a liaison between [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a4-s11-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; On [[2 May]] 1998, both of her parents were killed in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a4-s11-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Bellatrix's husband, [[Rodolphus Lestrange]], survived the battle, but was sent to [[Azkaban]] for his crimes.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a4-s11-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

This left the infant Delphi an orphan as her father had been. [[Euphemia Rowle]] took Delphi in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a3-s16-4|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; According to Delphi, Rowle was not fond of her.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a3-s16-4|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; She kept a pet [[Augurey]] and claimed that it cried because it knew Delphi was going to meet a &quot;sticky end.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a3-s16-4|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Delphi did not attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p1-a2-s14-5|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;She apparently had little to no contact with other children, claiming that she didn't have a best friend at the age of 14, and that she even invented an imaginary one when she was younger.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p1-a2-s14-5|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

At some point, Rodolphus was either released from Azkaban, or escaped a second time.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a4-s11-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He told Delphi about her true heritage and the prophecy he believed she was meant to fulfil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-p2-a4-s11-3|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== An ambitious plan ===
At some point, Delphi found [[Amos Diggory]], placing him under a [[Confundus Charm]] in order to pass herself off as his niece, Delphi Diggory, and to ensure he did her bidding.

On [[31 August]], 2020, Amos Diggory went to [[Harry Potter]] and urged him to use a [[Time-Turner]] to go back in time to the [[Triwizard Tournament]] and save his son, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]], who was murdered on the orders of Voldemort after winning the event.

Harry refused, but his son, [[Albus Potter|Albus]], overheard the conversation and later, along with his friend, [[Scorpius Malfoy]], decided to help the Diggorys to alter history and save Cedric. Albus and Scorpius visited the nursing home where Amos Diggory lived and where Delphi, posing as his niece, pretended to take care of him.

Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi sneaked into the [[Ministry of Magic]] and stole a Time-Turner. Using the Time-Turner, Albus and Scorpius seriously altered past events, creating two alternative realities, with the first seeing Hermione the bitter Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher while Ron was in a less happy marriage to [[Padma Patil]], and the second seeing a world where the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army lost the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. After many attempts, including Albus being erased by their changes, Scorpius managed to restore the correct timeline, and decided to destroy the Time-Turner on their own, not trusting the Ministry to destroy it.

Albus then sent an owl to Delphi. She arrived to Hogwarts just in time to see how he planned to try to destroy the Time-Turner. Albus wanted to apologise to her that they would not be able to go back in time to save Cedric. He and Scorpius explained that in the new reality they had created, Cedric’s Triwizard humiliation had turned him into an angry, bitter young man who became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and eventually murdered [[Neville Longbottom]] before he could destroy [[Nagini]], helping to usher in the era of the Dark Lord. Delphi said that Cedric would have understood, suggesting they should destroy the Time-Turner together, and explain to her uncle why Cedric would not be saved.

After Albus handed her the Time-Turner, both boys noticed a black tattoo of a bird on her back. Delphi said it was an [[Augurey]], which reminded her of her childhood as an orphan when she was raised by the Rowle family. The boys realised she was an enemy based on Scorpius recalling references to 'the Augurey' in the timeline where Voldemort won, but Delphi pulled out a [[wand]] and bound them together.

Delphi planned to travel back in time to ensure Cedric's survival in the third task of the Tournament (Unable to go back to the first two as the boys' actions made those events too temporally unstable). Albus refused, but she threatened to kill Scorpius. [[Craig Bowker Jr]], another Hogwarts student, rushed up to say that the whole school was looking for them, then was killed by Delphi immediately, similar to the nature of her parents who didn't hesitate to kill.

Delphi took Albus and Scorpius back in time with her, but they refused to cooperate. As Delphi prepared to kill Scorpius, she was struck from behind by an unsuspecting Cedric Diggory, who thought the scene was simply part of the Triwizard task. He freed the boys before returning to the challenge.

Then Delphi staggered to her feet and picked up the Time-Turner, but Albus and Scorpius managed to grab the device. They raced through time once again, but once they arrived, Delphi destroyed the Time-Turner and flew away.

Albus and Scorpius discovered that they had been transported to [[30 October]] [[1981]] — the day before Harry Potter’s parents were murdered by Voldemort. The boys realised that Delphi intended to stop Voldemort from trying to kill Harry, and thus triggering his own destruction when his [[Killing Curse]] rebounded on him due to [[Lily Potter]]'s [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]].

Meanwhile, the boys' parents were looking for them. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] told Harry he had seen Albus with an older girl the night before. Harry thought he must mean Delphi Diggory, Amos’s niece. They went to see Amos, who told them that he never had a niece. The Confundus Charm that Delphi had cast on him had waned.

The adults raced to Delphi’s room and found there writings revealing Delphi to be [[Tom Riddle]]'s daughter and that she believed she could restore him to power following the words of a prophecy.

=== Confrontation ===
: &quot;''You can't remake your life. You'll always be an orphan. That never leaves you.''&quot;
: —Harry Potter's words to Delphi about her father&lt;sup&gt;[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child|[src]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
:
Albus and Scorpius were able to send a message to their parents by leaving a message on Harry's old baby blanket, treated with a potion that would only become visible when it interacted with another potion Albus had spilled on the blanket shortly before this final trip back through time. Now aware of where their children were, Harry, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], Ron, and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] headed back to [[Godric’s Hollow]] in 1981 using another Time-Turner in order to help the boys. They found Albus and Scorpius, and all of them hid in a church, from which they could look out for Delphi without being seen.

Harry volunteered to [[Transfiguration|transfigure]] himself into Voldemort and lead Delphi into a trap. The others planned to wait in the church behind the large wooden doors until Harry was able to lure her inside.

Delphi finally appeared and Harry (disguised as Voldemort) pretended not to know who she was. She explained that she was the child of Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Lestrange.

He told her that together they could become an unstoppable force, but, by that time, the transfiguration had begun to fade. She saw that she was actually speaking to Harry, claiming she had studied him and knew him better than her father did. She locked the doors to prevent the others jumping out to help. Without a wand, Harry was forced to hide beneath a church pew while she attacked him. When Delphi was about to kill him, Albus popped up through a hatch in the floor, throwing a wand to his father. Together, they were able to overpower Delphi.

Delphi begged them to kill her or [[Memory Charm|wipe her mind clean]]. She claimed that she had only wanted to meet her father and be with him. Albus wanted to kill her to avenge Craig, but Harry stopped him. In a moment of empathy for her, Harry told her that she must learn to live with the fact that she will always be an orphan, as he has.

Delphi was then imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for her crimes.&lt;sup&gt;[[Delphini#cite note-act4scene11-6|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== History ==

===''The Springwood Killer''===
Devonne first appears in issue three of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (comics)|Nightmares on Elm Street]]''. She is a murderer known as the &quot;Springwood Killer&quot;. She follows [[Alice Johnson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Alice Johnson]] home and startles her. She begins talking to her son Jacob before she makes Alice uncomfortable and they go inside. Jacob expresses that he can read peoples minds and that he thought Devonne was interesting. Alice tells him to stay away from her saying that &quot;she makes me feel creepy.&quot; 
While driving, Devonne pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking man whose car broke. She flirts with the man and tells him to go lay in the bed in the back of the van. She then picks up a hammer that she had hid up front. She sneaks up behind him and bashes his head in repeatedly, killing him.

Devonne licks blood off of her fingers and Freddy appears. It is revealed that Devonne is collecting souls for him as long as he gives her the ability to control her dreams. Later, she goes to kidnap Jacob who tells her that he'll show her where his dad his.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Comics/nightmares-on-elm-street-3/nightmares-on-elm-street-3-01-cover.html|title=Nightmares on Elm Street #3|last=|first=|date=|website=Nightmare On Elm Street Companion|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issue four of ''Nightmares on Elm Street,'' Devonne is driving Jacob to the graveyard so he can show where his father is located. On the way there, Jacob says that he knows that Devonne is faking her southern accent to deceive people and that she doesn't really like him. He says that in the end she will like him because both her and Freddy need him. Jacob takes her to her father's grave, tricking her, he attempts to summon him but his efforts are ruined by Freddy. During a nightmare it is revealed that Devonne was severely abused as young child by her parents. One day she turned on the stove filling the house with gas and went outside with Jacob who entered her nightmare. 
When her mom lit a cigarette the house blew up killing her parents instantly. Devonne has a vision of her mother's corpse coming to life on the stretcher threatening her, which causes her to scream out &quot;You'll never punish me again&quot; revealing to her neighbors that she's the one who caused their deaths. Freddy lures Jacob away from her, which leaves Devonne trembling out of her fear. Freddy summons her telling her to go kill Alice and anyone near her and then sends her back to the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Comics/nightmares-on-elm-street-4/nightmares-on-elm-street-4-01-cover.html|title=Nightmares on Elm Street #4|last=|first=|date=|website=Nightmare On Elm Street Companion|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issue five, Devonne tracks down Alice and Yvonne at the Mercy Hospital. She walks in the hospital shooting everyone in her path. She threatens a nurse with her hammer to tell her where Alice is then proceeds to smash her jaw. Devonne then checks each of the rooms upstairs and before she can check the last one a cop appears and tells her to drop her weapon. She is shot in the shoulder and then proceeds to shoot the officer down who falls through the rooms glass window. She walks into the room and Yvonne grabs his gun and shoots her once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Comics/nightmares-on-elm-street-5/|title=Nightmares on Elm Street #5|last=|first=|date=|website=Nightmare on Elm Street Companion|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth and final issue of ''Nightmares on Elm Street,'' Devonne is dying but not completely as she believes that she will join Freddy in his dream realm. She stands by Freddy's side as he attempts to lure Jacob into being a part of his plan of bringing him back to life until Nancy Thompson stops him. When Freddy's undead army begins to attack Nancy, Neil Gordan and Alice, she realizes that he was only using her when the undead begin to attack her and he refuses to make them stop, saying &quot;you played your part.&quot; She then helps Neil and Nancy battle Freddy after it becomes clear to her that she was just another one of &quot;Freddy's playthings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Comics/nightmares-on-elm-street-6/nightmares-on-elm-street-6-01-cover.html|title=Nightmares on Elm Street #6|last=|first=|date=|website=Nightmare on Elm Street Companion|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

=== Characterization ===
Devonne is written as a severally mentally damaged woman who suffers from the aftermath of her abuse she went through from her a parents as a child. After murdering her parents she descended into madness but felt loved by [[Freddy Krueger]] and put a lot of trust into him thinking he'd help her control her dreams. She shows some form of humanity when she helps the protagonists defeat Krueger when he revealed that he was merely using her. Just like Freddy uses his notorious bladed glove, Devonne uses a silver hammer as her main weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lairofhorror.tripod.com/kruegerlair/comics/innovationcomic5.html|title=Devonne's Silver Hammer|last=|first=|date=|website=Lair of Horror|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The character has generally been well received with some critics calling her a lively addition to the franchise. Gavin Jasper praised the character saying:
:&quot;There’s a wild card introduced who brings some life into an otherwise lifeless cast named Devonne. She is basically Freddy’s agent in the waking world, helping him out of desperation. When she was a child, she burned down her home to kill her abusive father, but her mother died as well and Devonne’s been broken since. Not only is the incident the only thing she dreams of, but when she talks to people in real life, all she sees is them as skinless, much like how she last saw her mother. She figures that if she kills people for Freddy, Freddy will grant her at least one night of peaceful dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/a-nightmare-on-elm-street/250046/nightmare-on-elm-street-comics-a-nightmarish-history-lesson|title=Nightmare on Elm Street Comics: A Nightmarish History Lesson|last=Jasper|first=Gavin|date=October 31, 2016|website=Den of Geek!|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While reviewing issue four, Matt Molgaard praised the depth of the character. He said:
:&quot;Devonne’s traumatic past is the true focus of this issue, and it pushes readers to a point in which they’ve got to decide, to like or not to like. That’s the question. No child wants or deserves to be abused… but taking retaliatory actions to the degree of murder is pretty gnarly. There’s big success in character exploration and reader connection in this issue, and that gets big kudos from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://horrornovelreviews.com/2016/06/27/paying-nothing-loving-every-bit-of-marvel-and-innovations-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-comics/6/|title=Paying Nothing, Loving Every Bit of Marvel and Innovation’s ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ Comics!|last=Molgaard|first=Math|date=June 27, 2016|website=Horror Novel Reviews|publisher=|access-date=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third version ('''Chato Santana''') first appeared in ''El Diablo'' #1 (September [[2008 in comics|2008]]) and was created by Jai Nitz, [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] and [[Ande Parks]].

The Lazarus Lane incarnation appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and later [[Jay Hernandez]] portrays the Chato Santana incarnation in the live-action 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.

==Publication history==
Lazarus Lane was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Gray Morrow]] and debuted in ''[[All-Star Western]]'' #2 ([[cover-date]]d Oct. 1970). Lane starred in a four issue mini-series published by DC Comics through their [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint as a mature readers title; ''El Diablo'' #1 (March 2001) was written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and drawn by Danijel Zezelj.

Rafael Sandoval first appeared in ''El Diablo'' vol. 2, #1 (Aug. 1989) and was created by [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Mike Parobeck]].

Chato Santana first appeared in ''El Diablo'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2008) and was created by Jai Nitz, [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] and [[Ande Parks]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Lazarus Lane===
Lazarus Lane is the original iteration of El Diablo, operating in the later half of the 19th century in the [[American Old West]]. Lane was originally a [[bank teller]] who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a [[coma]] after being struck by [[lightning]]. After being revived by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]] &quot;Wise Owl&quot;, Lane becomes the [[vigilante]] El Diablo.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; The name [[wiktionary:El Diablo|El Diablo]] means &quot;the devil&quot; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

According to ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' vol. 2, #11 (Nov. 2006)  and #24 (Dec. 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor [[demon]] which acts as a [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while &quot;El Diablo&quot; roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]].  In ''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2, #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant. In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, [[Bat Lash]], [[Johnny Thunder]], and [[Madame .44]]) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and [[Jason Blood]] to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of [[Swamp Thing]], who had become lost in time.  When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in ''[[All-Star Western]]''. In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon. Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake. However, El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious.

===Rafael Sandoval===
Rafael Sandoval was the second iteration created in 1989 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe. This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas who creates his version of El Diablo (from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]]) after being stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using [[maquiladora]] covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

Rafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the ''[[Justice League]]'' titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;  He also appears in the [[Villains United|Villains United Special]] when he is pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Enclave M|Enclave M]] prison in the [[Sonora|Sonora Valley]], [[Mexico]]. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

===Chato Santana===
The current iteration of El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com//comics/080616-dc-solicits-sept08.html |title=DC Comics' September 2008 Solicitations |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=4739328&amp;postcount=1 |title=NEWSARAMA - View Single Post - EL DIABLO RETURNS AT DC IN 2008 |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written by [[Jai Nitz]], pencilled by [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], with inks by [[Ande Parks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080802-ElDiablo.html Jai Nitz &amp; Phil Hester - Introducing El Diablo], [[Newsarama]], August 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The New 52]] continuity and [[DC Extended Universe]], he is a member of the [[Suicide Squad]]. He is later recruited into [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] under the leadership of Uncle Sam, until he realizes that he is being lied to and abandons them in search of the truth.

The role was originated in 1991 by [[Kate Collins (actress)|Kate Collins]], who had also portrayed Janet's sister Natalie on the series since 1985. Collins played both characters until she left ''All My Children'' in 1992, and her replacement in the role of Natalie, [[Melody Anderson]], portrayed Janet for one day in 1993. With the Natalie character killed off, [[Robin Mattson]] played as Janet from 1994 to May 9, 2000. Collins made brief appearances in the role from November 28, 2005 to March 10, 2006,  from February 9, 2007 to December 18, 2007 and from April 30, 2010 to May 19, 2010. Collins briefly returned from July 25, 2011 until the finale on September 23, 2011.

The character was sometimes known derisively as &quot;Janet from another Planet&quot;.

'''Stefano DiMera'''&lt;!--Stefano's alias as the Phoenix is listed under Aliases, it doesn't need to be here--&gt; was a fictional character featured in the American [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. Created by head writer [[Pat Falken Smith]], he was portrayed by actor [[Joseph Mascolo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/josephmascolobio/ |title=Joseph Mascolo - Stefano - DAYS OF OUR LIVES - DAYS |publisher=Soapoperadigest.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefano is the patriarch of the [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera family]] and the father of [[Renée DuMonde]], [[Megan Hathaway]], [[Benjy Hawk]], [[Lexie Carver]] (née Brooks), [[EJ DiMera]] and [[Chad DiMera]] and the stepfather of [[Antony DiMera]]; He is also  the adoptive father of [[Peter Blake (Days of our Lives)|Peter]] and [[Kristen Blake]]. For a brief period, he believed he was the half-brother of longtime nemesis [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]]. He had a nephew, [[André DiMera]], who through plastic surgery became identical to Antony. In 2015, André was revealed to be Stefano's son. Stefano is the ex-husband of [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] and [[Vivian Alamain]]. Stefano first entered the show as a wealthy European businessman who relocated to Salem, and gradually revealed substantial ties to organized crime, both at home and abroad. Over the years Stefano's character has fluctuated between that of a crime lord (both on local and international scales), political terrorist, ruthless business tycoon, and loving (albeit heavy-handed) family man. ''Soap Opera Digest'' named him the all-time best villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josephmascolo.com/bestvillain.html |title=Joseph Mascolo voted best villain of all time by Soap Opera Digest article |publisher=Josephmascolo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting and development==
In the early 1980s, then head writer, [[Pat Falken Smith]] created the role specifically for Mascolo after seeing his performance as real-life crime boss, [[Salvatore Maranzano]] on the [[NBC]] miniseries, ''[[The Gangster Chronicles]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;SODMascolo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/josephmascolobio/|title=Joseph Mascolo - Stefan|publisher=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820220842/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/soapstarstats/josephmascolobio/|archivedate=2010-08-20|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo first appeared as Stefano on January 18, 1982. He departed from the series on March 8, 1983, and returned a year later on March 2, 1984 before briefly departing on May 11, 1984 only to return on October 19 and depart again on February 22, 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperiorJoe&quot;/&gt; Mascolo briefly returned to the series from November 4 to December 19, 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperiorJoe&quot;/&gt; Actor Frank Fata appeared in the role of Stefano for two episodes which aired on December 3 and 4, 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Exit/Recast&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2001/0409-mascolo.php |title= Mascolo might leave; Stefano could be recast |date=April 16, 2001 |first=Dan J.|last=Kroll |publisher= Soap Central |accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo reclaimed the role on a contractual basis on September 17, 1993. He departed from the show on December 24, 1996, and re-appeared for a few episodes from February 7 to 13, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo SOD Bio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/joseph-mascolo-bio|title=Joseph Mascolo Bio|publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]]|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo returned to the show full-time once again on June 13, 1997.

===Controversial '01 exit===
In late February 2001, a post on Mascolo's official website revealed that contract negotiations were not going well and Mascolo was expected to last appear in May. However, a representative of Mascolo's took to the website to deny the reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Future? 01&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2001/0312-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo's future at DAYS unclear|date=March 9, 2001|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2001, rumors of Mascolo's exit due to failed contract negotiations began to surface once again and the producers were apparently considering recasting the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Exit/Recast&quot;/&gt; Days later, Mascolo was spotted at [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''; despite the reports, neither Mascolo, NBC or CBS would comment on the rumors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo to B&amp;B&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2001/0423-mascolo.php|title=DAYS trouble could make Mascolo Bolder|date=April 20, 2001|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2001, Mascolo took to his website to confirm the news:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo OUT May 2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2001/0521-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo to DAYS execs: Bah humbug!|date=May 23, 2001|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|My contract is up in May and I tried to negotiate in good faith... Usually, one expects some give and take but the powers that be are adamant. They now feel that the character of Stefano should take a rest – as if Stefano ever rests.}}
Though Mascolo seemed disappointed with the show's decision to write the character out briefly, executive producer [[Ken Corday]] revealed plans to bring the character back by the fall of 2001 whether Mascolo was available or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo OUT May 2001&quot;/&gt; Mascolo made his last official appearance on June 14, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Exit Week 01&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2001/0611-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo, Stefano exit DAYS this week|date=June 10, 2001|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Mascolo initially denied the reports, he did indeed debut in the role of [[Massimo Marone]] on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in August 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Bold Move&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/bb/news/2001/0813-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo makes a Bold move|date=August 12, 2001|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='06 Return and storyline-dictated exit===
In the fall of 2006, following Mascolo's exit from ''B&amp;B'' due to lack of storyline, reports began to surface claiming that Mascolo was going to reprise his role as Stefano. The series' producers later confirmed plans to revive the DiMera family in order to stop a decline in ratings.&lt;ref name=&quot;SC Mascolo 2007 Return&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2007/0507-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo brings Stefano back to Salem|date=May 7, 2007|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deathly ill, comatose Stefano began appearing on December 19, 2006. Though some sources list Mascolo in the cast credits for the episodes, neither Mascolo nor NBC have ever stated that he portrayed comatose Stefano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Back 06&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2006/1030-mascolo.php |title= Report: Mascolo set to resurrect DAYS' Stefano |date= October 30, 2006 |first= Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed that Mascolo would reappear in the role officially in 2007, along with costars [[Thaao Penghlis]] ([[Tony DiMera]]) and [[Leann Hunley]] ([[Anna DiMera]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DiMerasReturn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/news/id/730/The_DiMeras_return_to_Days/|title=The DiMeras return to Days!

In May 2008, the tabloid ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' confirmed that Mascolo had been fired and Stefano was written into another coma. This decision did not sit well with Mascolo who gave a heated interview to ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' accusing the executives of &quot;double crossing&quot; him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo Out 08&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2008/05/04/joseph-mascolo-fired-from-days-of-our-lives|title=Joseph Mascolo Fired From Days Of Our Lives?|first=Lisa|last=K.|date=May 4, 2008|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|work=[[Daytime Confidential]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rise 08&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/news/2008/0714-mascolo.php|title=Mascolo's Stefano to rise again, thanks to a &quot;mutual conclusion&quot;|date=July 15, 2008|first=Dan J.|last=Kroll|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='08 Return, brief '12 departure, '16 exit, and '17 culmination ===
In the summer of 2008, it was confirmed that Mascolo would once again reprise his role as Stefano in August 2008. Mascolo later revealed in an interview that his initial anger was fueled by emotion following the death of his father. Following his initial ousting, fans took to his website to express how much they missed the character. The fan fervor allowed for Mascolo's return upon a mutual agreement with executive producer, Ken Corday. Mascolo reappeared on August 5, 2008 just before ''Days'' went on hiatus for the [[Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rise 08&quot;/&gt; In 2012, after breaking up the character's marriage to [[Lauren Koslow]]'s [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]], making him responsible for his own daughter [[Lexie Carver]]'s ([[Renée Jones]]) death and undoing his father/son relationship with [[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]'s [[EJ DiMera]], the character appeared to have been written into a corner. With nearly the entire town gunning for Stefano, several sources later confirmed that Stefano was indeed being killed off with Mascolo last appearing alive on June 4, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComingsGoings May 2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/05/29/days-of-our-lives-comings-and-goings-2.htm|title=Days of Our Lives' Comings and Goings|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|date=May 29, 2012|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo discussed his disapproval in an interview with ''Soap Opera Digest'':&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 Exit Interview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/05/31/joseph-mascolos-days-of-our-lives-exit-interview.htm|title=Joseph Mascolo's Days of Our Lives Exit Interview|date=May 31, 2012|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every single thing that went wrong in Salem was Stefano’s fault. Every single thing. He got blamed for everything. When Stefano got blamed for this business with Lexie illness, I got very angry. Stefano and his daughter had an absolutely pure relationship. I adore Renee Jones (Lexie). When she came to my dressing room and said, &quot;I’m going to be leaving soon, and this is what is going to happen,&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, no!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairman 2012 Exit&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/joe-mascolo-speaks-out-about-being-written-out-of-days-for-now/2012/05/31/|title= Joe Mascolo Speaks Out About Being Written Out Of DAYS … For Now!|date=May 31, 2012|first=Michael|last=Fairman|work=On Air, On Soaps|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was very difficult. The bottom line Stefano is will always be about family. So when they wrote that, I couldn’t figure it out. In all honesty, Stefano nor EJ would have had wanted it that way. As a matter of fact when James Scott (EJ) saw the business that Elvis wasn’t Stefano’s son, we both went, &quot;No, that’s wrong.&quot; We didn’t want it that way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairman 2012 Exit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 13, 2012, Mascolo goes off-screen following the character's funeral. Despite what was happening on-screen, certain sources reported that Mascolo could possibly reprise his role very soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairman 2012 Exit&quot;/&gt; Following the change in head writers, it was confirmed that Mascolo was indeed on his way back; he made his first appearance on August 21, 2012. Mascolo discussed that the plan was always to have Stefano turn out to be alive, but he didn't agree with how the previous writing regime had scripted the story. With the return of former show runners [[Gary Tomlin]] and [[Christopher Whitesell]], Mascolo seemed more &quot;intrigued&quot; with their plans for his character. Mascolo's return also coincides with [[Eileen Davidson]]'s return as Stefano's daughter [[Kristen Blake|Kristen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mascolo 2012 Return&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.about.com/b/2012/08/20/joseph-mascolo-dishes-his-return-to-days-of-our-lives.htm|title=Joseph Mascolo Dishes His Return to Days of Our Lives|date=August 20, 2012|first=Janet|last=Di Lauro|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo reappeared as Stefano on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS SID October 8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ins&amp;Outs |title=[[CBS]] [[Soaps In Depth]] |page=15 |date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Mascolo's own failing health, he departed the soap, last appearing on January 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Comings and Goings: Joseph Mascolo (Stefano DiMera) |title=Soap Opera Digest |pages=11  |date=January 25, 2016 |publisher=(Vol. 41, No. 4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mascolo made guest appearances on March 1, March 2, May 20, June 8 and July 7, 2016.

Mascolo died on December 8, 2016 in [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of 87 after years of battling [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/dayss-joseph-mascolo-passes-away-87|title=Days's Joseph Mascolo Passes Away at 87|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|agency=[[American Media (publisher)|American Media, Inc.]]|accessdate=December 9, 2016|location=United States|date=December 9, 2016|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2017, it was announced that Mascolo had filmed scenes prior to his death. Mascolo last appeared onscreen on February 9, 2017. However, it was later revealed that Mascolo appeared [[Shane Donovan]] who was posing as Stefano.

==Storylines==

===1980s===
Stefano first appears on-screen in January 1982 with his son [[Tony DiMera]] ([[Thaao Penghlis]]) surveying the citizens of [[Salem (Days of our Lives)|Salem]]. Stefano travels to Salem shortly after being introduced as the friend of [[Lee DuMonde]] ([[Brenda Benet]]) and it is soon revealed he is the father of Lee's daughter, [[Renée DuMonde|Renée]] ([[Philece Sampler]]), which adds complications to her relationship with Tony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap.comBIO&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/cast/133/Stefano_DiMera/|title=Days of Our Lives CAST - Stefano DiMera|accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stefano attempts to help Tony win back his wife, [[Liz Chandler]] while Stuart Whyland begins blackmailing him and Stefano kills him. In 1983, Stefano is sent to prison thanks to Detective [[Roman Brady]] ([[Wayne Northrop]]). Before his death, Stefano's wife, [[Daphne DiMera|Daphne]] ([[Madlyn Rhue]]), reveals that Tony isn't his biological son. Stefano returns in 1984 with his nephew, [[André DiMera|André]], who has gotten plastic surgery to look like Tony. Together they plan to frame Roman for a string of murders; meanwhile Stefano discovers another daughter, [[Megan Hathaway]]. Her adoptive father, Maxwell, had access to the &quot;''Three Prisms''&quot; that could cure Stefano's brain tumor. In November 1984, in his quest to obtain one of the prisms, Stefano apparently kills Roman after pushing him off a cliff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap.comBIO&quot;/&gt; In February 1985, [[Bo Brady]]'s ([[Peter Reckell]]) wife [[Hope Williams|Hope]] ([[Kristian Alfonso]]) is framed for Megan's murder and Stefano vows revenge on the entire family. He kidnaps Roman's twins, [[Sami Brady|Sami]] and [[Eric Brady|Eric]], and Roman's widow [[Marlena Evans|Dr. Marlena Evans]] ([[Deidre Hall]]) shoots him, apparently killing him.

Stefano resurfaces in 1988 to claim his son [[Benjy Hawk|Benjy]] who is about to be adopted by [[Kayla Brady]] ([[Mary Beth Evans]]) and her husband [[Steve Johnson (Days of our Lives)|Steve Johnson]] ([[Stephen Nichols]]), as well as to attempt to &quot;reprogram&quot; Roman, whom he had brainwashed in 1984–85, to serve as one of his assassins (Stefano actually got the idea about brainwashing his &quot;agents&quot; from former daughter-in-law [[Anna DiMera]] ([[Leann Hunley]]), who had hypnotized her own daughter [[Carrie Brady|Carrie]] into acting out against Roman as part of a plot to discredit him in the eyes of polite society). He traps several of Salem's citizens on his island but his plans for revenge are foiled and he escapes. In this iteration, Stefano is presented as more of an assassin and international terrorist than a simple gangster.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPro&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/stefano.php|title=Who's Who in Salem: Stefano DiMera|publisher=[[SoapCentral]]|accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In December 1991, [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]] ([[Drake Hogestyn]]) and Roman Brady discover Stefano in a Mayan pyramid in Mexico. The pyramid collapses and Stefano is once again believed to have perished. Though he survives the collapse, his brain tumor is slowly killing him. Stefano returns to Salem in 1993 and he is taken hostage by [[Curtis Reed (Days of our Lives)|Curtis Reed]] ([[Nick Benedict]]) in his weakened state; Curtis's attempt to extort money from Stefano's adopted daughter, [[Kristen DiMera|Kristen Blake]] ([[Eileen Davidson]]), is foiled after Stefano kills him.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPro&quot;/&gt; He then convinces Tony and Kristen to marry but the marriage is ruined when Stefano is revealed as the murderer. In an attempt to avoid capture, Stefano speeds away as John shoots out his tires and Stefano's car explodes. Stefano retreats to his [[New Orleans]] estate, ''Maison Blanche'' where he kidnaps Marlena and John. After the mansion burns down, Stefano buys a penthouse in Salem, next door to Marlena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap.comBIO&quot;/&gt; Stefano sneaks into her apartment every night and opens her soul, which leads to Marlena becoming possessed by a demon. Under possession, Marlena pushes Stefano out of a window; after the demon is exorcised, a guilt-ridden Marlena helps Stefano recover. In December 1995, Tony fakes his death and frames John.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soap.comBIO&quot;/&gt; Stefano is later struck by lightning and becomes so obsessed with Marlena that he bribes the judge presiding over John's murder trial to issue the death penalty. In August 1996 Stefano's plans to frame John are soon revealed and he skips town with Marlena to [[Paris]], where he is shot by his former lover Rachel Blake. Later, his longtime confidante, [[Celeste Perrault]] ([[Tanya Boyd]]) reveals that he fathered her daughter, [[Lexie Carver|Dr. Lexie Carver]] ([[Renée Jones]]) the wife of Salem's police commissioner. Stefano brings Kristen's lookalike, [[Susan Banks]] (Davidson) to town, impregnates her and plans to pass the baby off as Kristen's baby, which she actually miscarried; Susan gives birth in February 1997 to [[EJ DiMera|Elvis]] and flees after discovering Stefano's plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPro&quot;/&gt; After recovering from a heart attack, Stefano marries [[Vivian Alamain]] ([[Louise Sorel]]) on December 16, 1998, and plots to kill her to get back all of his belongings left to Vivian by her late husband–who was also Stefano's employee–[[Days of Our Lives characters (1990s)#Steven &quot;Jonesy&quot; Jones|Steven &quot;Jonesy&quot; Jones]] ([[Robert Mandan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DaysSummary1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/yearly_summaries_detail_172.html|publisher=DaysofourLives.com|title=Days of our Lives Yearly Summaries: 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Stefano brainwashes Hope Brady into thinking she is Princess [[Gina Von Amberg]] (Alfonso) and Gina, now in love with John, kidnaps him; feeling betrayed, Stefano exiles her to Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaysSummary1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/yearly_summaries_detail_173.html|publisher=DaysofourLives.com|title=Days of our Lives Yearly Summaries: 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In early 2000, the Bradys rescue Hope from Paris. Hope learns she is pregnant and Stefano believes he is the father. Stefano convinces Lexie to adopt a child, and then switches Hope's son with another, leaving the child with Lexie and husband [[Abe Carver]] ([[James Reynolds (actor)|James Reynolds]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DaysSummary2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/yearly_summaries_detail_175.html|title=Days of our Lives Yearly Summaries: 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the truth about the baby switch is revealed and Stefano skips town in June 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaysSummary2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/yearly_summaries_detail_176.html|title=Days of our Lives Yearly Summaries: 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an ill Stefano sends his son Elvis, now known as [[EJ DiMera|EJ]] ([[James Scott (actor)|James Scott]]), to impregnate [[Sami Brady]] ([[Alison Sweeney]]) so they can use the fetus's stem cells to improve Stefano's health. After they steal John's kidney, Stefano proposes that Sami and EJ marry and raise the child together so they can end the feud between the families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Days.comBio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://daysofourlives.com/show_guide/char_bio_detail_2784.html|title=Days of our Lives: Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo)|publisher=Sony Pictures|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the origins of the feud are known and it is revealed that Stefano's father [[Santo DiMera]] had an affair, and fathered a child with [[Colleen Brady]] ([[Shirley Jones]]) -- Ryan. Ryan was initially believed to be John Black, but it was later revealed that Ryan died in childhood. Stefano had once again erased John's memory in an attempt to turn him to the Pawn again. In 2009 Stefano EJ's then wife [[Nicole Walker]] ([[Arianne Zucker]]) hide the fact that she switched another baby with Sami's at birth. EJ is furious when he learns the truth and he kidnaps his daughter, [[Sydney DiMera|Sydney]] and fakes her death, leaving everyone devastated, including Stefano. Stefano learns from Anna DiMera that EJ paid her to care for Sydney while everyone believed she was dead; he uses the information to rebuild his relationship with EJ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Days.comBio&quot;/&gt; In September 2009, Stefano blackmails [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]] ([[Lauren Koslow]]) into marrying him after helping her get out from under attempted murder charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBCBio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/bios/joseph-mascolo/|title=Days of our Lives - Bios - Joseph Mascolo as Stefano DiMera|publisher=NBC.com|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2010, [[Madeline Peterson Woods]] ([[Jessica Tuck]]) returns to Salem and after she dies, it is revealed that her son, [[Chad DiMera|Chad]] ([[Casey Deidrick]]), was fathered by Stefano, and Madeline convinced Kate to keep the secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Days.comBio&quot;/&gt; In 2011, Stefano helps EJ kidnap Sami's husband, [[Rafe Hernandez]] ([[Galen Gering]]) and imprison him in the DiMera basement while putting a lookalike in his place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Days.comBio&quot;/&gt; In 2012, the DiMera empire begins to crumble when Stefano learns EJ isn't really his son and Lexie is diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor caused by exposure to toxic gasses when Stefano had André kidnap her. Meanwhile, Kate has an affair with Ian McAllister ([[Ian Buchanan]]), a past lover, and Stefano files for divorce, taking everything from her. Stefano also turns John and Hope back into the Pawn and Princess Gina after revealing they are married; he forces them to retrieve a precious coin from Alamainia for him. Several other schemes continue to backfire on Stefano, including his attempt to sabotage EJ's mayoral campaign and him blackmailing [[Will Horton]] ([[Chandler Massey]]). Having angered many of his enemies, Stefano is shot and presumably killed in early June 2012. Suspicion for the murder quickly falls upon EJ, who continuously professes his innocence, but no one, save for Will or Sami, seems to believe him. After a series of explosions rock Salem in early August 2012, EJ flees with Sami in tow, and is subsequently abducted by Ian, who professes that he framed EJ for Stefano's murder. Ian then pulls back a curtain, revealing a very much alive Stefano, who is unconscious, bound in a chair and wearing a mask. Ian also confesses to falsifying Alice's letter, as well as the blood test that stated EJ wasn't Stefano's son. Stefano suddenly resurfaces in Europe where he reunites with Kristen and convinces her to come home and bring the family back together. Following the deaths of EJ and Kristen, Stefano forges a strong bond with Chad ([[Billy Flynn (actor)|Billy Flynn]]). He encourages him to pursue [[Abigail Deveraux]] ([[Kate Mansi]]) with a secret agenda to obtain Abigail's inheritance but Chad foils his plans. In 2015, Stefano suffers a stroke and is left in a wheelchair which leads to André's return and the reveal that they are father and son. Stefano advises André as he takes over running the family's daily operations. In January 2016, a grief-stricken Hope kills Stefano believing he is responsible for Bo's recent death. Rafe helps Hope cover it up by hiding Stefano's body in an abandoned building and framing André. Stefano's spirit lingers as he appears to Chad and they say their goodbyes. Stefano last appears to Chad in July 2016 when they were talking about him trusting André. In February 2017, it appears that Stefano has been captured in [[Prague]] having supposedly faked his death at the hands of Hope. However, it is later revealed that Steve Johnson and [[Shane Donovan]] ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) have orchestrated Stefano's appearance to exonerate Hope of his murder, with Shane posing as Stefano using a bodysuit and makeup. Later as Steve and Shane reminisce about the success of their plan they review some pictures the ISA took from afar of Shane pretending to be Stefano. Yet the setting of one of the pictures is a place Shane never recalls posing at. This leads the men to wonder if the man in the photograph could actually be Stefano, leaving the two men wondering fearfully if the phoenix has actually risen once again and is out there somewhere.

==Fake death timeline==
The following list is a timeline of Stefano's fake &quot;deaths&quot;; he either faked them himself, was presumed dead, or was reported dead by others.

* A [[stroke]] in 1983. It was later revealed a fake heart attack, and dates is mentioned as March 8. 
* His car plunged into the icy waters of Salem's harbor during a police chase in 1984
* Marlena shot him, and he fell from a catwalk as the building caught fire in 1985 (he also had a brain tumor)
* In 1991, he was presumed to have died in another fire and cave collapse.
* In 1994, his car erupted into a fireball after being shot at by John.
* Also in 1994, he drowned near Maison Blanche.
* In 1996, he died in a plane explosion.
* Also in 1996, he was blown up and buried under collapsing tunnel during a confrontation with Rachel Blake. This was his last depicted &quot;death&quot; until 2007.
* In 2002, André DiMera (posing as Tony) claimed that his uncle had died from injuries sustained from a car crash in [[Monte Carlo]].
* In 2004, when Marlena and the presumed-dead Salem Stalker victims found a blackened, unrecognizable corpse on Melaswen, André (posing as Tony) claimed it was Stefano. André said he had killed Stefano by draining his blood so André could cure his own blood disease.
* In 2007, his death was faked once again. As a setup by the Salem P.D., Steven &quot;Patch&quot; Johnson appeared to stab Stefano to death, but he was drugged and a fake funeral was set up to lure André.
* In 2012, Stefano DiMera was shot dead from behind after several characters confronted him about his crimes. On August 16, Ian McAllister claimed to have killed Stefano and on August 20, Ian admitted to EJ that he killed Stefano and planned to frame EJ for the murder. On August 21, it was revealed that Stefano was not killed. Ian used an impostor that looked like him named Paolo. He faked the letter that said EJ was not Stefano's son and faked their blood types in the hospital.
* In 2016, Stefano was shot three times by Hope because of his alleged involvement in Bo's death.

==Notable possessions==

* '''Phoenix Ring''': Stefano's most iconic possession. A gold ring with a black flat square on top. It is embroided with a [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], and said to be the reason why Stefano keeps coming back to life. During the 2009 DiMera-Kiriakis war, Stefano's son EJ wore the ring while Stefano was held captive. It can apparently bring Andre back to life as well, since he is the son of the Phoenix. This was briefly contradicted in 2007 when Andre was revealed to be posing as Tony (who was assumed to be Stefano's son), and therefore was Stefano's nephew, This corrected in 2015 when Andre was revealed to be Stefano's son. Since Stefano's final death in 2016 Andre now wears the ring.
* '''Portrait''': Stefano's portrait has been hanging on the wall of the foyer of the DiMera mansion since 2007. The portrait is iconic and synonymous with Stefano's ownership of the mansion. Whenever he has lost possession of the mansion, the portrait is usually taken down. A safe is known to be hidden behind the portrait that contains valuable items to the DiMeras.
* ''''The key &quot;to ending the feud''': A gold key that Stefano kept around his neck. It was said to contain the secret to ending the Brady-DiMera feud.
* '''Chess set''': Stefano had a passion for playing chess, and kept a chessboard. Whenever Stefano felt he had the upper hand, he would mirror his moves with chess pieces. Stefano would often refer to the people he would use as &quot;pawns&quot;, and for the longest time the &quot;Queen&quot; symbolized [[Marlena Evans]], but Stefano would also use the &quot;Queen&quot; to symbolize any women that were important to his enemies. Stefano taught his sons Andre, EJ, and Chad and his grandson Theo to play chess and enjoyed playing chess with them. In 2016, when Hope shot Stefano, his hand symbolically knocked over all of the chess pieces as he fell back into his wheelchair.

'''Tinkerbelle Lisa &quot;Belle&quot; Dingle''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Eden Taylor-Draper]]. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 December 1998 and was originally played by twins James and Emily Mather, with the latter leaving the role in 2005. Belle has featured in many storylines throughout her time on the show such as falling down a mineshaft, killing her best friend [[Gemma Andrews]] (Tendai Rinomhota), and suffering from [[psychosis]], a mental illness triggered by what she did.

==Storylines==
Belle is born on Christmas Day 1998 to [[Zak Dingle|Zak]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]). Lisa is unaware that she is pregnant until she goes into labour and local vet [[Paddy Kirk]] ([[Dominic Brunt]]) delivers Belle. When Belle is seven-years-old, she goes missing, after she is left at home under the care of her uncle [[Shadrach Dingle|Shadrach]] ([[Andy Devine]]), who had fallen asleep. [[Daz Eden]] ([[Luke Tittensor]]) visits, bringing his pet ferret Spike. Although being warned not to, Belle lets the ferret out of his cage and in a panic, chases him through the fields. As she pursues him, she falls down a mine shaft. Daz is forced to leave the house, and when he finds her, dives in to help her out, but discovers that they are trapped, with the risk of freezing or drowning in the water. Daz manages to keep Belle afloat, until they are eventually rescued by the Dingles and the fire brigade. Belle acts as ring bearer at her cousin [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon]]'s ([[Mark Charnock]]) wedding to [[Donna Windsor]] ([[Verity Rushworth]]) and she briefly moves in with Marlon shortly after.

Belle's test results show that she is amongst the cleverest 2% of children her age and she wins a place at a private school, but she does not receive a full scholarship. The Dingles worry about how to pay the fees, and have to tell Belle that she is unlikely to go. [[Rosemary Sinclair|Rosemary King]] ([[Linda Thorson]]) takes a liking to Belle and offers to pay the fees. Lisa initially refuses, but when Belle falls ill and Rosemary visits her in the hospital, Lisa changes her mind. On her first day at the school, Belle is paired with Ayesha, who helps her get to know the school. They become fast friends, but when Ayesha convinces her to talk about Shadrach in class, the teacher is unimpressed. Belle convinces Rosemary to help her throw a party at Mill Cottage for her friends. At the party, she impresses the girls by claiming to live at Mill Cottage with Rosemary and [[Grayson Sinclair]] ([[Christopher Villiers]]). Belle's parents find out about the party and later discuss taking her out of the school. The Dingles end their friendship with Rosemary and Zak briefly take up bare-knuckle fighting to raise money for the school fees. His granddaughter [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) lends them the money so Belle can keep her place.

Belle and Shadrach steal Christmas presents from under the Woolpack Christmas tree, but they are soon found out. Belle befriends [[Will Wylde]] ([[Oscar Lloyd]]). Zak leaves and does not come home for Easter as he was supposed to, causing Belle to call a Dingle Court in which Zak gets ex-communicated from the family. Zak returns a couple of days later after a drinking spree and carrying an enormous brand new TV. As Belle and Will grow closer and Belle comforts him when he learns his father is dead. Will has to leave the village and he gives Belle his Nintendo DS. Lisa encourages Belle to say goodbye, and she rushes up to the taxi, shouting that she loves him. Will shouts that he loves her too. Belle dates [[List of Emmerdale characters (2013)#Luke Salter|Luke Salter]] ([[Daniel Pearson (actor)|Daniel Pearson]]), after meeting him at a party. They keep their relationship a secret, as he previously dated her friend [[Gemma Andrews]] (Tendai Rinomhota). When Gemma sees them together, she warns Belle that Luke is trouble. Her parents are also wary about the relationship, especially when Belle almost loses her virginity to him. Luke breaks up with Belle and she realises he only wanted to have sex with her. 

Belle befriends [[Sean Spencer (Emmerdale)|Sean Spencer]] (Luke Roskell) and dates his best friend [[Thomas King (Emmerdale)|Thomas King]] ([[Mark Flanagan (actor)|Mark Flanagan]]) to make him jealous. Gemma gives Belle a makeover after Sean laughs at her, which impresses Thomas. Belle's parents find inappropriate pictures of her on her phone, with evidence that Thomas took them. Sean steals a bottle of alcohol in an attempt to impress her, but he sees her with Thomas and smashes it. Belle's relationship with Thomas causes her to neglect Gemma. After a fight, Gemma sends Sean a suggestive photo of Belle which she had taken earlier in an attempt to get Thomas to notice her. However, Sean defends Belle and asks her if Thomas is making her do stuff, leading to her to angrily announce she never fancied him. In response, he posts the picture online. Thomas attacks Sean in defence of Belle. Sean apologises and she forgives him. Belle finds Thomas about runaway in [[Dan Spencer (Emmerdale)|Dan Spencer]]'s ([[Liam Fox]]) van, and she begs him to take her with him. [[Paddy Kirk]] ([[Dominic Brunt]]) believes that Thomas kidnapped Belle, and tells her family. Thomas later brings her back to the village. 

Sean asks Belle out and they make plans to have sex, but [[Dominic Andrews]] ([[Wil Johnson]]) interrupts them, claiming that Sean got Gemma pregnant. Belle abandons him and tells everyone at school that Gemma had an abortion, leading to a fight. Belle is suspended. She tells Debbie that she wanted to harm Gemma, which Dom overhears. After hearing Zak threatening to give her a beating, Belle drinks Debbie's leftover alcohol and loses consciousness. Belle is rushed to hospital, where her condition deteriorates as the alcohol was contaminated. Belle eventually wakes up and is discharged. She apologises to her mother. Belle and Sean grow close together, much to Gemma's displeasure. During an altercation with Gemma, Belle pushes her to the ground and Gemma hits her head. Belle apologises and tries to help her, but Gemma tells her to stay away and they walk off in opposite directions. [[Harriet Finch]] (Katherine Dow Blyton) finds Gemma's body near a hedge and she dies in hospital. Belle tells Lisa that she killed Gemma, but Lisa forbids her from going to the police. Belle leaves Gemma's funeral to hand herself in and she is charged with Gemma's murder.

Zak locks Belle in a barn to give her a taste of what prison would be like, and refuses to give Lisa the key to let her out. Belle believes that if she gets pregnant by Sean, she will avoid going to prison. But they later drop the idea. Belle's brother, [[Sam Dingle]] ([[James Hooton]]), tries to run away with her to escape a prison sentence, but Dom tips off the police and Belle is remanded. During the trial, Belle is sentenced to three years in prison, but she is forgiven by Dom. Belle later wins an appeal and her sentence is reduced to one year. When Belle is released from prison, she finds it hard to adjust to normal life again. She becomes erratic, dyes her hair dark and befriends [[Lachlan White]]. Belle is later discovered by [[Ashley Thomas]] ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) and Harriet Finch in the church, crying and covered in blood. Belle refuses to tell Zak and Lisa who attacked her. Belle considers trying to kill herself with painkillers, but she fails and breaks down in tears. Belle trashes [[David Metcalfe]]'s ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) shop and [[Edna Birch]]'s ([[Shirley Stelfox]]) house. It soon emerges Belle is suffering from a mental health crisis, as she believes she can see and talk to Gemma. Lachlan offers Belle a legal high pill, which she takes and is relieved to discover that the voices in her head stop. Belle asks Lachlan for more of the pills, which he gives to her. 

Belle is offered a job by [[Katie Sugden]] ([[Sammy Winward]]) on her new farm and Belle accepts. Belle's erratic behaviour worsens and when Katie witnesses Belle talking to an imaginary Gemma, Belle fights Katie and bites her arm. Belle locks herself in Katie's car and attempts to run down Zak. Belle tells Zak and Lisa that she has been hearing Gemma's voice since leaving the young offender's institute and she is referred to a psychiatrist. Belle later discovers that Katie has died and she believes that she was responsible for her death. Belle tries to kill herself, but is saved by her half-brother [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]). She is sectioned into a psychiatric unit until she recovers and returns home to her family. Belle's pony, Hamish, falls ill and has to be put to sleep. Belle goes into business with [[Kirin Kotecha]] ([[Adam Fielding]]) selling Granny Clegg's cordial drinks. Belle develops feelings for Kirin, but he wants to remain friends. Eventually, Belle and Kirin grow closer and begin a low-key relationship. They have sex, but realising that Kirin does not love her, Belle ends the relationship.

Belle witnesses her father kissing [[Joanie Wright]] ([[Denise Black]]) and she destroys Joanie's bedsit by flooding the place. On Christmas Day, Belle throws insults at her father and Joanie, finally revealing to the whole family that Zak and Joanie are having an affair. Zak and Lisa's marriage breaks down when he reveals he has fallen in love with Joanie. Belle confronts Joanie and spits in her face. She later slaps her across the face when Joanie insults Lisa. Belle tells Zak she is hearing voices to get her parents together again, but her plan fails. Lisa takes Belle out for driving lessons, after Belle refuses Zak offer to teach her. The family call a Dingle court, and the decision is made to excommunicate Zak from the household. Belle continues to support her mother as she adjusts to being a second-time divorcee, even encouraging her to make a fresh start with the family by her side.

Belle cuts her hand on some glass and encounters [[Jermaine Bailey]] ([[Micah Balfour]]), who treats her hand. She is attracted to Jermaine, but soon learns he is married. Belle steals Joanie's engagement ring and insults her, leading Joanie to slap Belle. Jermaine and Belle meet at the factory to have sex, and they start a fire when a candle is knocked into a bin. Zak is arrested as [[Rishi Sharma]] accuses him of starting the fire, but Belle admits it was her and she is sacked. Jermaine is called to check up on Lisa after an angina attack and finds out Belle is only 17. Jermaine ends the relationship, but they soon get back together. Belle confesses all to [[Charity Tate]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), who takes her to the doctor for emergency contraception. Cain finds out about Belle's relationship and Jermaine gets Belle to admit to stalking him, so they can continue their affair. His wife, [[Angie Bailey]], becomes suspicious and questions Belle, who admits to having an affair with Jermaine. 

Jermaine is fired from the surgery and when he plans to leave, Belle claims she is pregnant. Charity becomes suspicious of Belle and she finds out Belle is lying to keep Jermaine. Belle and Charity form a plan to pretend Belle has had a miscarriage. Belle begins talking to a friend from prison, Ellie (Ashlie Robinson), but she is one of Belle's visual hallucinations. Belle convinces Charity she is actually pregnant. Belle is asked by Joanie to be bridesmaid at her wedding to Zak, to which she agrees. Ellie manipulates Belle into pouring red wine on Joanie's dress and Lisa covers for her. Belle shows Jermaine a scan photo, which she took from Charity. Angie overhears Belle talking to Ellie and exposes her lies in front of her family. Belle suffers a breakdown in the café and is taken home by her parents. When the paramedics arrive, the family discover Belle has gone. The family search for Belle, who is living rough and tormented by Ellie. Lisa is angry with Zak when he fails to answer a phone call from Belle and she leaves a voicemail. A body is found by the police, who Lisa and Zak identify, but it's not Belle. Belle's sleeping bag is taken by three men, and out of desperation tries to steal a piece of toast from a customer's plate in a cafe. The cafe owner later tries to feed Belle, but she runs away when he talks to a police officer and she ends up collapsing from malnutrition and dehydration. Belle is taken to hospital and Lisa and Zak are informed, but when they visit, Belle lashes out at Lisa, thinking she will kill her. Belle is assessed and Zak, Lisa and Jermaine are told Belle is hearing more than one voice and Jermaine thinks Belle has schizophrenia. Zak and Lisa are informed that they want to send Belle to a unit in Surrey.

Belle returns over six weeks later to visit her family for the day.

==Casting==
Twins Emily and James Mather were cast as Belle after their mother, Joanne, was told the soap's producers were looking for babies to play a role in the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;DingleBelles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dingle+Belles%3b+(But+one+of+them+is+a+boy).-a060162696|title=Dingle Belles; (But one of them is a boy)|date=24 January 1999|work=[[The People]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained &quot;My two had just been born so I contacted casting. When they saw Emily and James they liked them straight away and they made their first appearance when they were only 10 days old.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DingleBelles&quot;/&gt;  The twins were brought in when the producers realised that the role would be too demanding for one child to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;DingleBelles&quot;/&gt; Emily and James took it in turns to play Belle. Their mother was on-set all the time and chose which twin appeared on-screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;DingleBelles&quot;/&gt;

As Belle grew older and her storylines increased, the new actress was sought for the part. After a series of auditions, [[Eden Taylor-Draper]] was cast as Belle and she began appearing on-screen in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Percival&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/1434622.display/|title=Meet the Belle of the ball|last=Percival|first=Charlotte|author2=Lewis, Stephen|date=30 May 2007|work=[[The Press (York)|The Press]]|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
It was revealed on 23 January 2014 that Belle would have a life-changing storyline later in the year which would see her unintentionally kill her best friend, [[Gemma Andrews]] (Tendai Rinomhota) after an argument gets out of hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a546014/emmerdale-belle-dingle-to-kill-gemma-andrews-during-row.html&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, the character confessed and was charged with murder. In June 2014, the character was charged with [[manslaughter]] and later sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. This sentence was later reduced to 1 year in August 2014.

In March 2016, it was reported that Belle would fall for Jermaine Bailey, a local doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/654868/Emmerdale-Spoiler-Belle-Dingle-Dr-Jermaine-Bailey|title=Emmerdale Spoiler - Belle Dingle falls for Dr. Jermaine Bailey|work=Express|last=Kelly|first=Helen|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/news/a787740/shock-new-emmerdale-romance-belle-dingle-will-fall-for-older-doctor-jermaine-bailey/|title=Shocl new Emmerdale romance?

Taylor-Draper also stated she regards the storyline as a coming of age storyline for Belle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/05/emmerdale-star-eden-taylor-draper-talks-to-metro-co-uk-about-belle-dingles-shock-affair-and-what-happens-next-5790330/|title=Emmerdale: Eden Taylor-Draper talks to Metro.co.uk about Belle Dingle's shock affair and what happens next|work=Metro|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
For her portrayal of Belle, Taylor-Draper earned the Spectacular Scene of the Year award at the 2006 [[British Soap Awards]] along with co-star [[Luke Tittensor]] for the storyline where Belle and Daz fell down a mineshaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a33354/in-pictures-the-british-soap-awards-2006.html|title = In Pictures: the British Soap Awards|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|last=Green|first=Kris|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she won Best Young Actor at the [[Inside Soap Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7010000/newsid_7011600/7011668.stm|title=Young girl wins top soap award|work=[[Newsround]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=25 September 2007|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merle Dixon''' is&lt;!--NOTE: He is a fictional character, not &quot;was&quot; a fictional character. See &quot;Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Television#Lead paragraphs&quot;; his being a fictional character does not change simply because he died in the television series. --&gt; a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[drama]] television series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', which airs on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and is based on the [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|comic book series of the same name]]''. ''He was created by series developer [[Frank Darabont]] and portrayed by [[Michael Rooker]]. The character was first introduced in the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] as a Southern redneck hunter who has a younger brother, [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]]. He is [[misogynistic]] and racist, which causes tensions between him and his group of survivors. Following an encounter with series protagonist [[Rick Grimes]], Merle disappears and joins the community of [[Woodbury, Georgia]], where he becomes the right-hand man of [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|the Governor]]. He becomes caught in the conflict between the Governor and Rick, especially when nobody in Rick's group wants him in the group, except for Daryl.

The character's introduction garnered negative reviews from professional critics, but fan response was positive. When the character reappears in the [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|third season]], reviewers began to have more favorable views towards him. Merle is an original character in the television series and shares no counterpart in the comic books. He is also a main character in the 2013 [[video game]] ''[[The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct]]'', which focuses on him and Daryl during the early days of the [[zombie apocalypse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haworth|first=Drew|title=Terminal Reality’s The Walking Dead: Norman Reedus is Daryl Dixon|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/11/29/terminal-realitys-the-walking-dead-norman-reedus-is-daryl-dixon/|work=Playstation.Blog|publisher=SCEA, LLC|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caulfield|first=Luke|title=Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker Voicing Activision's New Walking Dead Game|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/4365/20121130/norman-reedus-michael-rooker-voicing-activisions-new.htm|work=GameNGuide|publisher=G&amp;G|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooker made guest appearances as Merle in the series' first and [[The Walking Dead (season 2)|second]] seasons, before he was upgraded to a series regular for the third season, where he lost a significant amount of weight in preparation for the role. Rooker was among the cast members who were awarded the [[Satellite Award for Best Cast – Television Series]] in 2012.

==Television series==

===Fictional character biography===
Merle is&lt;!--NOTE: He is a fictional character, not &quot;was&quot; a fictional character. See &quot;Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Television#Lead paragraphs&quot;; his being a fictional character does not change simply because he died in the television series. --&gt; the older brother of [[Daryl Dixon]]. Having no mother and a neglectful and abusive father, Merle raised Daryl when not incarcerated in juvenile detention. Though the length of time and military occupational specialty are not stated, Merle served in the [[United States Marine Corps]], where at some point he mouthed off to a non-commissioned officer and subsequently punched five of his teeth out. According to [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane]] and [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]], Merle was a drug dealer before the outbreak. He is also shown to have been a drug user (e.g., in &quot;[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]&quot; and &quot;[[This Sorrowful Life]]&quot;).

====Season 1====
Merle first appears in the episode &quot;[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]&quot;, along with a group of survivors who had traveled into Atlanta to scavenge for supplies. While atop a department store roof, Merle begins firing a rifle at [[zombies|walkers]] on the street while the group demands that he stop. Merle gets into a physical altercation with [[T-Dog (The Walking Dead)|T-Dog]] ([[IronE Singleton]]) after Merle calls him a [[nigger]], and subsequently beats T-Dog in a brief, intense fight. After momentarily announcing himself leader of the group, Merle is blind-sided by [[Rick Grimes]] ([[Andrew Lincoln]]), who punches him and handcuffs him to a pipe before Merle can fight back. Merle is put under T-Dog's watch while the other survivors attempt to find a way out of the city. When the survivors do find a way out, T-Dog attempts to save Merle, but accidentally drops the handcuff keys into a vent; this forces him to abandon Merle on the roof. Before T-Dog flees, he chains the rooftop door shut to prevent walkers from getting Merle.

In the next episode &quot;[[Tell It to the Frogs]]&quot;, as walkers begin to invade the building and reach the chained rooftop door, Merle struggles until he notices a hacksaw by the spilled toolbox the others had left behind. He uses his belt to reach the hacksaw and ultimately cuts off his own hand to escape, as the hacksaw blade was too dull to cut through the handcuffs. Rick and the group return to the camp and explain to Daryl that they abandoned Merle. Daryl, T-Dog, Rick and [[Glenn (The Walking Dead)|Glenn]] ([[Steven Yeun]]) decide to return to Atlanta to retrieve him as well as a bag of weapons Rick dropped downtown. Returning to the department store roof, the four see that Merle has severed his own hand with a dull hacksaw. In the next episode &quot;[[Vatos]]&quot;, the four find evidence that Merle survived the self-mutilation by cauterizing the wound. They follow Merle's blood-trail through the department store but are unable to find him. Back outside, they discover their truck has been taken. Rick feels that the truck might have been stolen by Merle during his escape.

====Season 2====
[[File:MerleDaryl.jpg|250px|thumb|Merle appears as a hallucination to Daryl.]]
Merle remains missing throughout the second season. He only appears in the episode &quot;[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]]&quot;, wherein Merle taunts and mocks Daryl in a hallucination for giving up on searching for him and reminds Daryl that he is in a group that had left Merle for dead on the rooftop. Merle also berates Daryl for a perceived weakness that Merle blames on the time Daryl has spent with the group.

====Season 3====
In the episode &quot;[[Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)|Walk with Me]]&quot;, Merle is found to be living in [[Woodbury, Georgia#In popular culture|Woodbury]], where he has earned the status of the [[The Governor (The Walking Dead)|Governor]]'s right-hand man. He has fashioned a knife attachment onto the stump where his hand used to be. He has been hoping to find his brother, Daryl, since his own separation from the group. While investigating an incident involving a crashed helicopter, Merle and a group of survivors from Woodbury encounter [[Michonne]] and fellow Atlanta survivor [[Andrea (The Walking Dead)|Andrea]], and bring them back to Woodbury, along with the sole survivor of the helicopter crash. In the episode &quot;[[Killer Within]]&quot;, Andrea gives Merle directions to the last location where she had seen Daryl.

Merle is noticeably kept in line by the Governor, a sharp contrast to his nature in the Atlanta group. In the episode &quot;[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]&quot;,  Merle allows Michonne to leave Woodbury at the Governor's orders, but in the next episode, &quot;[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]&quot;, the Governor sends Merle to lead a posse to hunt down Michonne. He wounds her and she kills members of the posse, but when Michonne escapes into the red zone, Merle calls off the hunt, reporting to the Governor that he killed her. Later on, Merle runs into Glenn and [[Maggie Greene|Maggie]] from the Atlanta group. He asks them to take him to Daryl. They refuse, so he holds Maggie hostage and demands Glenn drive them to Woodbury. In the episode &quot;[[When the Dead Come Knocking]]&quot;, Merle unsuccessfully tortures Glenn to obtain the location of the group, including beating Glenn and leaving him locked in a room with a walker and tied to a chair. In the episode &quot;[[Made to Suffer]]&quot;, Rick's group infiltrates Woodbury and rescues Glenn and Maggie, Michonne attacks the Governor; furious at losing an eye and his reanimated daughter to a woman Merle reported as dead, he publicly accuses Merle of treason and reveals that he has captured Daryl. In the episode &quot;[[The Suicide King (The Walking Dead)|The Suicide King]]&quot;, the Governor orders Merle and Daryl to fight to the death, but they are saved by Rick and Maggie, who attack Woodbury. When Merle begins to insult the group, Rick knocks him out. Rick's group decides not to include Merle because of his attitude and his transgressions against Maggie and Glenn, but Daryl opts to leave the group to join Merle, refusing to leave his brother behind again.

Merle and Daryl spend time fending for themselves in the woods. In the episode &quot;[[Home (The Walking Dead)|Home]]&quot;, they come across a family being attacked by walkers and Merle half-heartedly assists in Daryl's efforts to rescue them. Merle then attempts to rob them, but Daryl points his crossbow at him and lets the family drive off before walking off on his own. Merle follows and they get into a physical confrontation, where the depth of their father's abuse is shown when Merle inadvertently exposes scars on Daryl's back. Merle realizes that his leaving home resulted in Daryl becoming the target of their father's abuse. It is also revealed that the brothers had originally planned to rob the Atlanta group. Daryl then leaves to go back to the prison, despite Merle's claims that the group will never accept him. The brothers arrive at the prison at the tail-end of an assault by the Governor and his men, who have crashed a truck through the prison gate and unleashed a horde of walkers onto the prison grounds. Merle and Daryl save Rick from attacking walkers.

In the episode &quot;[[I Ain't a Judas]]&quot;, Merle is promptly locked inside a prison cell, where he shares what he knows about Woodbury and the Governor with the group. He bonds with Hershel and apologizes to Michonne, claiming his attack on her was simply following the Governor's orders. Later, Merle, hearing [[Beth Greene|Beth's]] singing, walks into the cell block where he and Rick share an antagonizing look from across the room. In the episode &quot;[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]&quot;, Merle unsuccessfully tries to get the prison group to attack the Governor after fighting Glenn. He later tries to get Michonne to join him with his mission.

In the penultimate season three episode &quot;[[This Sorrowful Life]]&quot;, Rick confides in Merle, Daryl, and Hershel that the Governor promises to leave the prison alone if they hand over Michonne. Rick plans to do as the Governor requests, and asks Merle to help deliver Michonne to the meeting place at noon. Merle, knowing that Rick will not go through with it, traps and ties up Michonne. However, after he and Michonne talk about personal matters, he lets her go and returns her [[katana]], telling her he has something to do alone. He starts drinking whiskey before using loud music to lure a group of walkers to the exchange site where the Governor is waiting to ambush whoever will show up. The music also distracts the Governor's henchmen while Merle secretly takes cover, intent on killing the Governor both for revenge and to prevent him from killing anyone else at the prison, mainly Daryl. After shooting several of the henchmen, Merle is caught and beaten by [[Ceasar Martinez|Martinez]] and two other men and then, injured and winded, fights one-on-one with the Governor. The Governor gets the upper hand and bites off two of Merle's fingers. A wounded Merle then yells that he will not beg for mercy before the Governor shoots him in the chest with a pistol. Later on, Daryl, who left the prison to track down Merle and Michonne after Rick noticed them missing, finds Michonne unhurt and continues on to the exchange site, where he sees a reanimated Merle eating [[Ben (The Walking Dead)|Ben]]'s corpse. Daryl breaks down in tears and pushes his reanimated brother away more than once before stabbing him repeatedly in the head, killing him for good.

==Development and reception==
Actor [[Michael Rooker]] described his thoughts on the role: &quot;Merle is a survivor of the Zombie Apocalypse. And you can tell when you first meet him that even before all the shit went down he was kind of an asshole. We don't play a lot of it up in our portrayal but he's the kind of person where you're not really sure if he should be in charge... if he would be a good leader or not, though he certainly thinks he is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deskofbrian.com/2010/11/michael-rooker-interview-merle-dixon-on-the-walking-dead|title=Michael Rooker interview (Merle Dixon on &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;)|publisher=The Desk of Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merle was one of a number of characters introduced in the second episode of the series, &quot;[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Kirkman was pleased with Rooker's performance, retorting that it was &quot;'The Michael Rooker Show' for one solid episode.&quot;&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/08/the-walking-dead-kirkman/|title='The Walking Dead': Comic book series creator Robert Kirkman talks about last night's 'Guts'-y episode|first=Clark|last=Collis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I actually got a chance to hang out with him and he's a totally awesome guy. He always plays bad guys and psychos and it's weird, because he's this really boisterous, friendly guy. But yeah, his character is very important to the life of the show. He's a completely original character that was never in the comic. He's kind of the first human that they come across where it's like, 'Hey, this guy's really dangerous.' Also Michael Rooker likes to ad-lib. He got us over our cursing limit a couple of times. I think it was a bit of a pain in the a—for the post production people.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] disliked the introduction of Merle, calling him &quot;ridiculous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2010/11/08/the-walking-dead-guts-review |title=The Walking Dead: &quot;Guts&quot; Review|publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=November 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Pierce of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that &quot;Merle is a huge sore thumb in the middle of the episode:  behaving like no one in his situation ever would, his character seems to exist for no other reason than to cause dramatically convenient trouble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/guts,47247/ |title=Guts |work=The A.V. Club |first=Leonard |last=Pierce |date=November 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the next episode, &quot;[[Tell It to the Frogs]]&quot;, Pierce notes that even though &quot;Merle is a racist asshole who might have gotten everyone killed, in a world where the only real distinction is between the living and the dead, leaving him to be torn apart leaves a bit of a bad taste in everyone's mouth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tell-it-to-the-frogs,47650/ |title=Tell It To The Frogs |work=The A.V.

Rooker confirmed his appearance in the second-season episode &quot;[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]]&quot; at the 2011 Aliens to Zombies Convention at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/11/10/walking-dead-michael-rooker-on-the-return-of-merle-dixon/|title=‘Walking Dead’: Michael Rooker on the return of Merle Dixon|first=Susan|last=Karlin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Nobody expected this level of Merle worship,&quot; he articulated. &quot;He's such an out-there, crazy, anything goes kind of guy. There's an uncertainty about Merle—like he'll come back when you least expect it. He's the boogeyman, and viewers love that suspense. The number one question I'm asked is, 'When is your character coming back?' I can't say when, but I promise it’ll be a wild ride.&quot;&lt;ref name=la/&gt; Writer [[Robert Kirkman]] insisted that Rooker was a delight during production, and hoped that he would regularly appear on ''The Walking Dead''.&lt;ref name=ent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/11/14/the-walking-dead-kirkman-chupacabra/|title='The Walking Dead': Writer Robert Kirkman talks about tonight's episode, 'Chupacabra'|first=Clark|last=Collis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]]|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But that's probably intentional; for all the Governor’s calm planning, Merle is a hothead, an asshole who thinks he's a leader, and so he's going to keep making impulse decisions until one of those decisions gets him killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hounded&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hounded,88080/ |title='Hounded' |work=The A.V.

It was always a stretch that Merle would just happen to find the Grimes Gang again, considering the sheer lonely expanse in the new zombie-infested world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darren |last=Franich |url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/walking-dead-premiere-lori-rick/ |title='The Walking Dead' recap: No Bullets in Me |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen called the episode's opening &quot;a decent sequence&quot; which put the cliffhanger's high stakes aside, partly because Merle and Daryl made it out alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handlen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-suicide-king,92106/ |title=The Suicide King |work=The A.V. Club |publisher=Onion Inc |first=Zack |last=Handlen |date=February 10, 2013 |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Goldman at [[IGN]] specifically praised the performance of Michael Rooker in &quot;[[This Sorrowful Life]]&quot;, the final appearance of Merle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/25/the-walking-dead-this-sorrowful-life-review|title=The Walking Dead: &quot;This Sorrowful Life&quot; Review |publisher=IGN |first=Eric |last=Goldman |date=March 24, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen called the episode's last scene &quot;a good one, and it leads to the terrific final confrontation between Daryl and zombie Merle that makes up for a lot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorrowful&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/this-sorrowful-life,95348/ |title=This Sorrowful Life  |work=The A.V. Club |first=Zack |last=Handlen |date=March 24, 2013 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handlen commented: &quot;I'm not sure I buy or even understand Merle's change of heart, given how inconsistent the character has been. In his conversations with Michonne, we're being sold the idea that he's deeply conflicted about all the murdering he's done, and that he's had something like a change of heart since joining the prison group. Which doesn't really fit into anything, although at least now Merle's gradual integration with the main ensemble makes a little more sense; he wasn't supposed to be a monster, just a messed up asshole who eventually had enough regrets to try and do the right thing. There's no background for this, and no real depth to Merle apart from Michael Rooker's performance (and Rooker is almost single-handedly responsible for any consistency the character ever had).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorrowful&quot;/&gt; He also felt that with Merle letting Michonne go, &quot;it's nice to have a character actually behave better than you were expecting them to for once. And everything else with Merle from then on is great, from the scene with him drinking whiskey and using rock music to attract a herd of walkers, to his ambush of the Woodbury group that was waiting to ambush Rick, to the fight with the Governor. And, of course, the last bit, with Daryl finally finding his brother after it’s too late to save him. While the show so often struggles with finding emotion or resonance in its conversations [...] there are still wordless exchanges like this, with Daryl sobbing as he stabs Merle again and again and again. There's no real complexity to what's happening, and no mystery, but it's powerful regardless, inspiring fear and pity for both characters, and ending the hour on a high note.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorrowful&quot;/&gt;

'''James Doakes''' is a fictional character on the Showtime series, [[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]] and the series of novels by [[Jeff Lindsay (writer)|Jeff Lindsay]]. In the TV series, he was portrayed by [[Erik King]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/38294/Erik-King|title=Erik King|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character biography==
Doakes enlisted in the U.S. Army and went on to become an [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]], serving with the elite [[Regimental Reconnaissance Company|Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title = See-Through|episodelink = See-Through|series = Dexter (TV series)|serieslink = Dexter (TV series)|network = [[Showtime Networks|Showtime]]|airdate = October 21, 2007|season = 2|number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending many years in [[black operation]]s, Doakes gave up his military career, electing instead to use his skills to help civilians as a police officer. Doakes's police career grinds to a halt when he receives [[excessive force]] citations; his volatile, angry nature proves he cannot work well with others (unless leading them). Doakes was partnered with [[Maria LaGuerta]], which ended after she was promoted following a high-profile drug bust.

===Season one===
Doakes hates [[Dexter Morgan]]; he is the only person in Dexter's life who can see through his mask of normality. Doakes suspects that Dexter is hiding something, and has no reservations about telling him so. Ultimately, Doakes realizes that Dexter is withholding vital information on the Ice Truck Killer case, to the point that he is driven to physically attack him, only for Dexter to expertly fight back.

===Season two===
LaGuerta tells him to back off, but Doakes begins following Dexter in secret. Doakes ends his investigations when he finds Dexter attending a [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meeting, supposedly for [[heroin]] addiction; Doakes erroneously believes Dexter's dark secret is that he is a [[drug addiction|drug addict]]. Feeling sympathetic towards Dexter for once, Doakes briefly leaves him alone.

Doakes resumes the hunt after [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] reveals that Dexter doesn't even smoke. After Doakes starts investigating Dexter's past, Dexter goads him into a fight &amp;mdash; seemingly unprovoked &amp;mdash; in front of the entire squad room. Doakes is initially prepared to accept dismissal and take a high-paying security job LaGuerta set up for him, only to begin suspecting Dexter is the notorious Bay Harbor Butcher when Special Agent Frank Lundy mentions shoddy blood work as a reason for the [[acquittal]] of one of the Butcher's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Morning Comes |episodelink=Morning Comes (Dexter) |series= Dexter (TV series)|serieslink=Dexter (TV series) |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |airdate=November 25, 2007 |season=2 |episode=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doakes, in the course of following Dexter, stumbles upon Santos Jimenez's remains and Dexter's blood slide collection box, and realizes Dexter's secret: He is the Bay Harbor Butcher. Ironically, Doakes becomes the prime suspect in the case when he leaves Miami to get the blood slides analyzed. Doakes attempts to apprehend Dexter himself in the [[Everglades]], but Dexter gets the upper hand and locks him in Jimenez's cabin until he can decide what to do with him. In the end, Dexter's erstwhile lover [[List of Dexter characters|Lila Tournay]] finds the cabin, and makes the decision for him: after finding out from Doakes that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher, she tries to protect him by blowing up the cabin, thus eliminating Doakes as a witness. Doakes's incinerated remains are found along with the dismembered body of Jose Garza, and so the case is closed, with the official conclusion being Doakes was the Butcher. Later on, Dexter avenges Doakes's murder by murdering Lila. Doakes's funeral is largely unattended, with the exception of LaGuerta, Dexter, and Doakes' mother and sisters. Doakes is replaced as sergeant by [[Angel Batista]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;The British Invasion&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The British Invasion |episodelink=The British Invasion |series= Dexter (TV series)|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=December 16, 2007 |season=2 |episode=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season seven===
When LaGuerta finds the blood slide with Dexter's victim Travis Marshall's blood on it, she suspects that the real Bay Harbor Butcher is still alive. Dexter, determined to stop LaGuerta, cements his frame job of Doakes by planting kill tools and plastic wrap (with Doakes's prints) at an abandoned ship yard.

In the [[Surprise, Motherfucker!|season finale]], Doakes makes an appearance, in flashbacks of previously unseen confrontations between him and Dexter set before the events of season 1, and detailing how he became suspicious of Dexter, as well as his romantic involvement with LaGuerta &amp;ndash; a major motive behind her determination to clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Surprise, Motherfucker!|episodelink=Surprise, Motherfucker! |series= Dexter (TV series)|serieslink=Dexter (TV series)|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=December 16, 2012 |season=7 |episode=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the novels==
In the novels, Doakes's first name is &quot;Albert&quot;, and he served in [[El Salvador]] with the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Dexter believes that Doakes has a &quot;Dark Passenger&quot; of his own, and deals with it by being as violent as he legally can in his job. After LaGuerta's murder at the end of ''[[Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]'', Doakes believes Dexter was the killer, and tails Dexter in ''[[Dearly Devoted Dexter]]'', intending to &quot;catch him in the act&quot;.  Instead, Doakes himself is captured by &quot;Dr. Danco&quot;, a [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] doctor who served alongside Doakes and blames him for the torture he suffered at the hands of Salvadorean guerrillas; to get revenge, he [[torture]]s Doakes by removing his feet, hands, and tongue.  In ''[[Dexter in the Dark]]'', Doakes returns briefly, but cannot communicate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Michelle &quot;Shell&quot; Dockley''' is a [[fictional character]] from the award-winning prison drama series ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]''.  She is portrayed by British actress [[Debra Stephenson]]. Shell was one of the lead characters in the series. Shell appeared from the first episode in [[Bad Girls (series 1)|Series 1]] until the last episode of [[Bad Girls (series 3)|Series 3]], and returned for the first four episodes of Series 5.

==Personality and characterization==
Shell Dockley was sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing and murdering a girl named Lisa Simmonds, who had an affair with her boyfriend; she tied the girl up, tortured her and eventually set her on fire. Shell is violent and ruthless, and delights in acts of cruelty and torture; officers and prisoners alike call her a [[psychopath]]. She is a drug dealer and pusher, and has no real friends on the wing, except [[List of Bad Girls characters#Denny Blood|Daniella &quot;Denny&quot; Blood]] ([[Alicya Eyo]]), a relationship that also has a sexual side to it. Shell has an affair with corrupt and abusive principal officer [[Jim Fenner]] ([[Jack Ellis (actor)|Jack Ellis]]), a relationship which eventually went sour in Series 2 after Jim discovered that Shell had telephoned his wife Marilyn ([[Kim Taylforth]]) to hear him and Shell having sex. Jim responds by beating up Shell physically. Jim and Shell's relationship came to an end for good after she stabbed him with a broken bottle in the opening episode of Series 3, coming within a whisker of murdering him. In Series 2, Shell states that the judge who sentenced her to life imprisonment had called her &quot;evil personified&quot;.

==Storylines==

===Series 1===
Shell was seen as Top Dog among the prisoners of G-Wing. She is first seen rehearsing for the prison's annual fashion show, which is soon cancelled. She is best friends with Denny, who is also her occasional lover. She is involved in a relationship with married officer Jim Fenner, who is also having an affair with [[List of Bad Girls characters#Rachel Hicks|Rachel Hicks]] ([[Joanne Froggatt]]), a young prisoner who Shell bullied. Eventually, Rachel commits suicide. When she discovers [[List of Bad Girls characters#Zandra Plackett|Zandra Plackett]] ([[Lara Cazalet]]) was blackmailing officer [[List of Bad Girls characters#Lorna Rose|Lorna Rose]] ([[Luisa Bradshaw-White]]), she too began blackmailing Lorna and forced her to smuggle in drugs for her. Shell also made an enemy of religious prisoner [[List of Bad Girls characters#Crystal Gordon|Crystal Gordon]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]), but briefly became religious and together she and Crystal reported Lorna and got her sacked. Shell soon reverted to her old ways.

Shell is usurped as top dog on G Wing by Yvonne Atkins ([[Linda Henry]]) by the end of Series 1.

===Series 2===
Shell gets a mobile phone smuggled into Larkhall and calls Fenner's wife, Marilyn, to let her know about the affair. She makes an enemy of [[List of Bad Girls characters#Babs Hunt|Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Hunt]] ([[Isabelle Amyes]]), and when they get into a fight, Babs pushes Shell resulting in an injury. However, Shell doesn't report her, due to Babs being much older and timid. Shell then fears if the truth about the fight got out, it will damage her &quot;tough girl&quot; image. Shell then begins acting strangely and eventually tells Wing Governor [[List of Bad Girls characters#Karen Betts|Karen Betts]] ([[Claire King]]) that she was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by her father as a child. She is vexed when she discovers Karen is now in a relationship with Fenner. When Fenner enters her cell and begins having sex with her, she pulls out a broken glass bottle and stabs him in the stomach with it.

===Series 3===
Karen hears Fenner screaming after Shell stabs him and almost the entire prison staff attempt to save him. However, Shell barricades the door, and makes demands to be brought up to her cell in a swinger. The other prisoners cheer her on as they all hate Fenner. When her cell door is finally broken down, she is eventually restrained. [[Sylvia Hollamby]] ([[Helen Fraser (actress)|Helen Fraser]]) is furious when Shell is allowed back on G-Wing, so has her transferred to the psychiatric unit of the prison, which the inmates refer to as &quot;the muppet wing&quot;. She forces Shell to share a cell with &quot;Mad&quot; Tessa Spall ([[Helen Schlesinger]]), a former G-Wing prisoner whom Shell did not get along with. However, Tessa appears to become infatuated by Shell. When Sylvia sees her plan is not working, she tells another mental patient, &quot;Podger&quot; Pam Jolly ([[Wendi Peters]]), that Shell has stolen her medication, and then lets Pam into the shower where Shell is. Pam brutally beats up Shell, while a delighted Sylvia looks on. Fenner eventually helps Shell escape. Denny and her girlfriend [[List of Bad Girls characters#Shaz Wiley|Shaz Wiley]] ([[Lindsey Fawcett]]) escape with her, however they lose Shaz, who is subsequently caught and returned.

Shell and Denny stay with a [[pimp]] in [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] for the night, and the next day wear wigs to conceal their identities. They break into the Hollamby residence, and when Sylvia returns home, they take her hostage and force her to dress as French maid and serve them cocaine on a tray. When her undertaker husband Bobby returns home, they take him hostage too. The pair also take the Hollambys' money and Shell wrecks Sylvia's priceless ornaments. That night, Shell and Denny tie Bobby and Sylvia up, before going to bed together. The next morning, when Shell discovers Bobby has tried to break free, she places him in a coffin in their garage, and forces Sylvia to nail the coffin shut. Shell then begins to pour petrol over the coffin. After tying Sylvia to the garage door, Shell sets the coffin on fire. As the police arrive, Shell and Denny make a run for it in Bobby's hearse. They hide out in former cellmate Crystal's place. Shell overhears Crystal trying to warn Denny about her, so the next morning Shell plants drugs in Crystal's bedroom and calls the police, impersonating a civilian telling them that Crystal helped hide them. They immediately leave and tell Crystal they are going to stay with Shell's auntie Nelly in Scotland - this is lies as they both go to leave for Spain with false passports. Crystal is subsequently arrested and returned to Larkhall. Shell and Denny are not seen again until the last episode of the series, where Shell makes a phone call to Sylvia, impersonating a mattress sales person. She asks Sylvia if her husband would prefer to sleep in a black coffin instead. Sylvia becomes terrified as she realises Shell is on the other end of the phone. The call is traced and Shell and Denny are arrested on a boat, however they make one last escape, and jump into the sea.

===Hiatus===
Shell does not appear in Series 4, but is mentioned numerous times. At first, it is reported on the news that neither Shell or Denny were found in the sea, much to Sylvia's delight. But Denny is later re-captured and returned to Larkhall, with news that Shell was last seen speed boating while under the influence of drugs and Shell is presumed dead. Sylvia and Bobby later visit the spot where Shell &quot;died&quot; for closure.

===Series 5===
Shell, it seems, did not actually drown and is discovered in a strip club in [[Amsterdam]] by Fenner and other officers on a weekend trip. Shell is captured and reveals that she is pregnant. She plans to finish her sentence in Amsterdam, hoping that she is not extradited back to England. She is set up by her former lover Jeremy Pugh and is forced to return to Larkhall.

Once back in Larkhall, she goes back on the lifers unit and immediately sets up a deal with Fenner, who begins pimping her to the male prison officers. Shell and Denny are also reunited, and plan to get revenge on [[Snowball Merriman]] ([[Nicole Faraday]]) for killing Shaz. Shell gets Snowball on her side by promising to give her a beauty makeover. After getting Snowball prepared for a makeover, Denny then proceeds to set fire to Snowball's hair.

Shell continues her business with Fenner and soon goes into labour, giving birth to a baby boy who she names Ronan Beckham Dockley. Prison officer [[List of Bad Girls characters#Colin Hedges|Colin Hedges]] (Tristan Surrock) later comes into Shell's cell and forces her to have sex with him, but Shell refuses to do so in front of her child. Fenner hears the shouting and enters the cell to find Colin there. A nurse enters the room and Fenner, not wanting his secret with Shell and the other officers exposed, lies and tells the nurse that Shell tried to smother her baby. Shell is later removed from the prison and sent to a mental hospital. Ronan is then taken into care.

==Bad Girls: The Musical==

'''Doctor Destiny''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Doctor Destiny first appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' Vol. 1 #5 (June 1961), which was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Doctor Destiny | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 102  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Doctor Destiny was once a petty criminal scientist who used his [[genius]] to create astounding devices for crime. He first encountered the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] shortly after he invented an [[anti-gravity]] device and will-deadener beam that allowed him to capture [[Green Lantern#Silver Age Green Lantern|Green Lantern]] by luring him into his base using anti-gravity discs to fly over the city as Green Lantern, impersonate him, and infiltrate the JLA. Before Doctor Destiny could further his criminal ends, however, the Leaguers discovered his treachery as Green Arrow had heard a member had been captured and was being impersonated from an underworld informant. The League was captured by his will-deadening beam, that also had [[kryptonite]] as an element. Destiny then revealed he planned to send his ship into space, thus getting rid of the JLA. However, when drawing the JLA upwards, the station suffered a brief power drain, lessening the effects of the will-deadener. Green Lantern was able to free himself during the drain, and promptly imprisoned Destiny and his two henchmen.

===Morpheus===
He then created the &quot;Materioptikon&quot;, a device which allowed him to create reality from the fabric of [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' 19 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; In a later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] in the Sandman series written by Neil Gaiman, his mother, Ethel (the former mistress of [[List of characters in The Sandman#Roderick Burgess|Roderick Burgess]]), gave him [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]]' Dreamstone, which powered the device. He manipulated the Dreamstone, forcing flaws and adding circuitry, until it was attuned to him and not the Dream King. Morpheus was imprisoned by [[Alex Burgess]] at the time, unaware of what Doctor Destiny was doing and unable to stop or prevent it.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

Doctor Destiny's power was so great that the [[Justice League]] resorted to drastic measures to stop him. They hypnotized him and manipulated his psyche to prevent him from [[dream]]ing; this kept him from using the Materioptikon for criminal purposes but caused him to lose his mind and shrivel to a skeletal wreck of a man. He was then sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], where his sanity eroded further.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt;

He escaped from Arkham and captured the [[Sandman (DC Comics)#Garrett Sanford|Sandman]] (Dr. Garrett Sanford), and used his equipment to pit people's dreams against the Justice League, eventually capturing most of the current Leaguers. Thanks to the efforts of others such as [[Zatanna]] and [[Elongated Man]], the Sandman was freed and reclaimed his equipment, aiding Doctor Destiny's recapture.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkham Asylum===
Again from The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman, when Doctor Destiny's mother died, Doctor Destiny escaped Arkham, reclaimed the Ruby, and used it to go on a rampage, driving the whole world insane. Doctor Destiny makes his way to a 24-hour diner and proceeds to torture the patrons in numerous sadistic ways (including making some of them have sexual intercourse against their will) over the span of 24 hours, before having them kill each other. [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], recently freed and searching for his stolen tokens of power, could not stop Doctor Destiny until the villain decided to leech all of Dream's power into the Ruby and destroy the gem. The destruction of the Dreamstone returned all of its power back to Dream, including power the Lord of Dreams had been without for millennia. Morpheus then returned Doctor Destiny to Arkham and returned his ability to dream (or at least sleep). Although he is able to dream once again, Doctor Destiny's sanity is still extremely shaky.

Doctor Destiny later learned that continued use of the Materioptikon meant he still had some dream manipulation powers even without the Dreamstone. He warped the [[Atom (comics)#Silver Age Atom|Atom]]'s dreams of the original Justice League into a world where the [[superhero]]es were [[fascism|fascist]] bullies, as part of a plan to trap the then-current Justice League there. He was defeated when the comatose [[Blue Beetle]] was able to enter the dream world. Later, Doctor Destiny threatened the JLA once again by bringing his &quot;dream self&quot; into the real world and attacking them with bizarre and irrational dream-logic, &quot;haunting&quot; scenes of his old crimes as well as Atlantis (the ocean signifying a spiritual centre in dreams). Fortunately, before Destiny's dream-self fully realized what was happening to him, he was defeated when the League tracked down his real-world self and projected their dream selves into reality to confront Destiny; since the League were dreaming about victory, they couldn't lose, and Destiny was swiftly returned to his cell in Arkham.

Over the years, Doctor Destiny has proven one of the Justice League's most persistent foes.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc-ency&quot;/&gt; In his earliest appearances, before he lost his sanity, his goals were more rational: to acquire wealth and personal power, to eliminate all his enemies, and so on. All of these schemes revolved around the creative and liberal use of the Materioptikon, a strategy which often caught his opponents off-guard. One can assume that Doctor Destiny is still interested in attaining all of his former goals: the elimination of the Justice League, the restoration of his human appearance, and the reconstruction of the Materioptikon.

===4th Parallel===
During the 4th Parallel storyline in ''JLA Classified'', Doctor Destiny's control over the Materioptikon is usurped by Darrin Profitt the [[Red King (DC Comics)|Red King]].

===Justice Society of America===
In the previews for future issues of ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3), [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] mentioned &quot;''It's the doctor. The one with no face!''&quot;, which would allude to future appearances by Doctor Destiny (i.e., his skeletal face). He finally appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' Vol. 3 #4, back in his old costume, with the captured [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legionnaire]] [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] chained in his cell in [[Arkham Asylum]]. He uses Dream Girl's nightmares to deal with the asylum guards. When [[Batman]], [[Sandy Hawkins|Sandman]], [[Thom Kallor|Starman]], and [[Geo-Force]] arrive at the asylum, Starman goes up against Destiny by himself, but is subdued when Destiny uses Dream Girl's powers to create a zombified version of Kenz Nuhor, the man Starman killed. Starman begs Destiny to let Dream Girl go, and awakens her from her trance by using the &quot;wake-up&quot; word. When she awakens, Dream Girl tells Destiny that she foresaw his death, being killed in his sleep by the [[Daniel Hall|owner of the Dreamstone]] before she knocks him out.

===Superman/Batman===
In the [[Superman/Batman]] storyline '&quot;Mash-Up&quot;, Doctor Destiny created a dream world consisting of combinations of people from the real world, hoping to replace the waking world with his fabricated realm. Superman and Batman, who had somehow managed to escape being fused together, stopped Destiny by freeing the combined form of [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] and [[Zatanna]]. The backlash from the broken illusion put Destiny into a comatose state, mumbling the name &quot;Bruce Kent&quot; - the only combined being he was unable to create. Of note, however, he appears again capable of massive reality warping without direct control of the Materioptikon in the waking world, or at least enough magical power to fuel the creation of a new world using only dreams as his base.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman/Batman'' #60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In &quot;[[The New 52]]&quot; (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Doctor Destiny first appears at the end of ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' #19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Jeff Lemire, Ray Fawkes|artist=Mikel Janín, Vincente Cifuentes|story=Horror City Part 1: The House of Mystery|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=19|date=June 2013|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.R.G.U.S. is in possession of his Dream Stone, which John Constantine recognizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Jeff Lemire|artist=Mikel Janin|story=The Black Room|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=9|date=July 2012|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In issue 20, it is revealed that [[Madame Xanadu]] is Dr. Destiny's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=Ray Fawkes, Jeff Lemire|artist=Mikel Janin, Vincente Cifuentes|story=Horror City Part 2: The Nightmare Gospel|title=Justice League Dark|volume=1|issue=20|date=July 2013|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the &quot;[[Forever Evil]]&quot; storyline, Doctor Destiny is among the villains recruited by the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] to join the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Forever Evil'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

While tracking various threats from his original timeline, the displaced pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' [[Superman]] joined forces with [[Dick Grayson]] to track the New 52 Doctor Destiny, eventually trapping the powerful foe after confronting him in Superman's dream-recreation of his timeline's Bludhaven.&lt;ref&gt;''Nightwing'' (vol.4) #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Destiny has the ability to manipulate anyone's dreams. Basically, Doctor Destiny can use twisted versions of dreams to commit crimes. He can, for example, make people become murderers by exploiting their secret dreams, since in dreams, we are all uninhibited. He can also explore a particular person's dream to create a kind of dream world, where everything happens based on a misrepresented version of that dream, and send people there. It is possible that at this point he just carries the mind and body people to the dimension of dreaming, but nothing in the text suggests this.

Doctor Destiny also has an extensive medical knowledge.

==Other versions==
===Batman: Arkham Asylum===
* In [[Grant Morrison]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman]]'' [[graphic novel]], ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'', Dr. Destiny is referred to by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and makes a short appearance later in the novel. In the annotated script for ''Arkham Asylum'', Morrison explains that he was not a fan of the popular depiction of the Doctor as a tall, musclebound man with a skull for a head. Rather he believed that Destiny's body would have &quot;whithered horribly&quot; after having been robbed of the ability to dream.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Grant, and Dave McKean. Arkham Asylum: a Serious House on Serious Earth. New York, N.Y.: DC Comics, 2004. 146. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[Dave McKean]] (the artist) portrays him as being atrophied and feeble, restricted to a wheelchair, but still wielding a latent amount of power which could not be ignored (though he was mentioned as needing eye contact with a victim to disable them). He is however defeated quite easily by Batman, who kicks the villain's wheelchair down a set of steps before he has a chance to display his powers.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Grant, and Dave McKean. Arkham Asylum. Lonson: Titan, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Dr Destiny Justice League.jpg|right|thumb|Dr. Destiny as he appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode &quot;Only a Dream&quot;]]
* Dr. Destiny was briefly considered to be featured in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. [[William Atherton]], who later went to voice the character in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', was considered for the role.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/destiny.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* Atherton later voiced Doctor Destiny in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode &quot;Only a Dream&quot;. John Dee was a low-level [[LexCorp]] employee and small-time crook who was incarcerated in Stryker's Prison for guarding a supply of smuggled weapons. He volunteered to be a [[Guinea pig#Scientific research|guinea pig]] for a doctor's experiments with the Materioptikon, a machine that gave people [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] abilities. Between sessions, he dreamt of single-handedly defeating the [[Justice League]] and being a member of the [[Injustice Gang]] when [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] arrive to recruit him. When he found out that his parole request didn't go through, John was saddened. His wife Penny left him soon after for another man, exacerbating the situation. John found an opportunity to abuse the Materioptikon during a prison riot, exposing himself to an intensified burst from the machine. The experience gave him even greater [[telepathy]]. With this, he set off to wreak havoc on people through their dreams. Dee's first act of supervillainy was using his abilities to mentally torture Penny in retribution for turning her back on him. In her dream, he manipulated his appearance to match his standard comic book costume and, deciding that his name was too ordinary, took the new name &quot;Doctor Destiny&quot;. As a result of his telepathic torture, Penny died from traumatic shock. Dr. Destiny later trapped [[Superman]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and the [[Wally West|Flash]] in their dreams, playing out their worst fears: Hawkgirl (who was [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], as revealed in an earlier battle with [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]]) was trapped in a coffin and buried alive, Flash was trapped inside a world where he moved so fast that the world around him was virtually motionless, Superman's powers increased beyond his ability to control them and he accidentally caused massive destruction and killed all those he loved, and Green Lantern (who feared his membership in the [[Green Lantern Corps]] had cut him off from his life on Earth) found himself trapped in a world in which he was now truly alienated from his friends and family. [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] telepathically entered his teammates' dreams to make them realize that what they were experiencing was not real, while [[Batman]] eventually tracked down Doctor Destiny (keeping his mind free of Destiny's influence by humming ''[[Frère Jacques]]''). Attempting to stab Batman with a syringe filled with a powerful [[sedative]], Dee inadvertently stabbed and injected himself. Destiny was last seen back at Stryker's in a [[catatonia|catatonic]] state humming ''Frere Jacques'' over and over again.
* Doctor Destiny appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode &quot;I Am Legion&quot;, having apparently recovered from his condition as well as gaining the ability to resume his nightmare form even in reality. He appears as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. He was very briefly seen with [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]]'s team of supervillains in &quot;Alive!&quot; where he is killed by Darkseid.
* In Season 3 of ''[[Smallville]]'' episode &quot;Slumber&quot;, Clark connected with a girl named Sara Conroy in their dreams while she was in a coma, helping her to confront a monster called &quot;The Traveler&quot; that served as a manifestation of Sara Conroy's fear of her uncle Nicholas, who was keeping her unconscious to allow him to gain control of money she had gained in an inheritance from her deceased parents. This manifestation was very similar to Doctor Destiny except for his red torn cape and his face was never seen.

===Film===
* Destiny appears as the main antagonist of the animated film ''[[Justice League Dark (film)|Justice League Dark]]'', voiced by [[Alfred Molina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/15/justice-league-dark-trailer-debut-for-r-rated-dc-animated-movie|title=JUSTICE LEAGUE DARK: TRAILER DEBUT FOR R-RATED DC ANIMATED MOVIE|publisher=IGN|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|date=November 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is an evil sorcerer and former opponent of [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]]'s and [[Etrigan]] the Demon. Destiny was said to have been a former man of science by Merlin in [[King Arthur|Arthurian times]] before turning insane after wielding the power of his personal artifact, the Dreamstone. With it, he brought many towns to their knees by making them live their worst nightmares, but a group of knights led by Jason Blood attempted to defeat him. All of them were mortally wounded, forcing Merlin to unleash the power of Etrigan, which forced Destiny's soul into the Dreamstone. In the climax of the film, it's revealed that [[John Constantine]]'s old friend [[Ritchie Simpson]] made a deal with Destiny that would give him immortality to cure him of his disease. However, Destiny exploited a loophole in their deal by possessing him and wreaking havoc in a nearby city. While he was able to defeat [[Swamp Thing]] and Etrigan, Destiny was ultimately defeated by Constantine and [[Deadman]], and the Dreamstone ends up destroyed along with Destiny.

===Miscellaneous===
* Doctor Destiny has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book. His appearances are in issues #25, where [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] summons him alongside [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], Dala, [[Hugo Strange]]'s Monster Men, [[Man-Bat]], [[Professor Milo]]'s werewolves, and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to help fight [[Batman]] and [[Zatanna]].

'''Dr. Henry Jekyll''' and his alternative personality, '''Mr. Edward Hyde''', is a fictional character in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1886 novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Henry Jekyll is a &quot;large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast&quot;, who occasionally feels he is battling between the good and evil within himself, thus leading to the struggle between his dual personalities of Jekyll and Edward Hyde. He has spent a great part of his life trying to repress evil urges that were not fitting for a man of his stature. He creates a serum, or potion, in an attempt to mask this hidden evil within his personality. However, in doing so, Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde, a hideous, evil creature without compassion or remorse. Jekyll has many friends and has a friendly personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power. After taking the potion repetitively, he no longer relies upon it to unleash his inner demon i.e., his alter ego. Eventually, Hyde grows to be stronger than Jekyll.

Stevenson never says exactly what Hyde takes pleasure in on his nightly forays, generally saying that it is something of an evil and lustful nature. Thus, in the context of the times, it is abhorrent to Victorian religious morality. Hyde may have been reveling in activities that were not appropriate to a man of Jekyll's stature, such as engaging with prostitutes or burglary. However, it is Hyde's violent activities that seem to give him the most thrills, driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason, making him a hunted outlaw throughout England.

A [[lawyer]] named Gabriel Utterson and Dr. Jekyll's [[butler]] Mr. Poole end up breaking into Dr. Jekyll's lab. Inside, they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll's clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find also a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery. Utterson takes the document home where he first reads Lanyon’s letter and then Jekyll's. The first reveals that Lanyon’s deterioration and eventual death resulted from the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde drinking a serum or potion and as a result of doing so, turning into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter explains that Jekyll, having previously indulged unstated vices (and with it the fear that discovery would lead to his losing his social position) found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. But Dr. Jekyll's transformed personality Mr. Hyde was effectively a sociopath — evil, self-indulgent, and utterly uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll was able to control the transformations, but eventually he would become Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

At this point, Dr. Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Mr. Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Dr. Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work. One day, at a park, he considered how good a person that he had become as a result of his deeds (in comparison to others), believing himself redeemed. However, before he completed his line of thought, he looked down at his hands and realized that he had suddenly transformed once again into Mr. Hyde. This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Mr. Hyde needed help to avoid being caught. He wrote to Lanyon (in Dr. Jekyll's hand), asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Hastie Lanyon's home in Cavendish Square. In Lanyon's presence, Mr. Hyde mixed the potion and transformed back to Dr. Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse them. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Dr. Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson.

Eventually, the stock of ingredients from which Dr. Jekyll had been preparing the potion ran low, and subsequent batches prepared by Dr. Jekyll from renewed stocks failed to produce the transformation. Dr. Jekyll speculated that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work (a salt) must have itself been contaminated. After sending Poole to one [[chemist]] after another to purchase the salt that was running low only to find it wouldn't work, he assumed that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments. His ability to change back from Mr. Hyde into Dr. Jekyll had slowly vanished in consequence. Jekyll wrote that even as he composed his letter, he knew that he would soon become Mr. Hyde permanently, having used the last of this salt and he wondered if Mr. Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll noted that, in either case, the end of his letter marked the end of the life of Dr. Jekyll. He ended the letter saying &quot;I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end&quot;. With these words, both the document and the novella come to a close.

The original pronunciation of Jekyll was &quot;Jeekul&quot; which was the pronunciation used in Stevenson's native Scotland. This is also the pronunciation of [[Gertrude Jekyll]].

In this episode, Captain Kirk is duplicated by a transporter beam accident thus creating the dual personalities without developing rather than a medical serum for the plot device. Upon arrival on the ship, a good but passive captain, practically incapable of being dominant and thus commanding as a captain must be is assumed by all to be the only Captain Kirk. Shortly thereafter, his evil or 'other' duplicate arrives seeking pleasure, drink, women, and command. The duality of each captain, one displaying excessive passivity and the other extreme violence, will ultimately end in the destruction of each unless they are reintegrated into one captain. In the Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the Victorian era exploration of Christianity's inner conflict of good and evil results in Dr. Jekyll succumbing to man's inner evil and becoming Mr. Hyde in the end. In ''Star Trek'''s &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; retelling, it is the negative or evil side that is portrayed as the source of strength and leadership necessary for effective command. By combining the positive aspects of man's dual inner nature, a holistic view of the future is presented that draws on man's deep past as written in the [[Book of Job]].
* The ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]'' episode &quot;Nowhere to Hyde&quot; features the Ghost of Mr. Hyde, who is committing jewelry store robberies and one of the suspects is a descendant of Dr. Jekyll. The Ghost of Mr. Hyde later made a cameo in ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King]]'' as a patron in a monster bar.
* In the ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'' episode &quot;Nowhere to Hyde&quot;, the criminal Willie the Weasel (voiced by [[Henry Corden]]) creates a similar formula (which is related to Dr. Jekyll's formula) that turns him into Mr. Hyde.
* In the ''[[Gravedale High]]'' episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, there is a medical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) that works as a doctor for the monsters. Mr. Hyde serves as Dr. Jekyll's &quot;partner&quot; where Dr. Jekyll would turn into him for any second opinions of anyone's medical problems.
* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode &quot;Brain Meets Brawn&quot;, voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. Dr. Jekyll was seen taking a serum that turns him into Mr. Hyde where is then attacked by the police. They take a break in the conflict when tea time occurs. Afterwards, the police subdue Mr. Hyde and take him away to the police station. Dr. Jekyll's serum inspires brain to take it so that he can break Big Ben in this monster form whenever Brian gets angered.
* The 2007 TV serial ''[[Jekyll (TV series)|Jekyll]]'' starred [[James Nesbitt]] as Tom Jackman, a modern Jekyll whose Hyde persona wreaks havoc in modern London.

Unlike the original story, the main character is a highly respected [[neurosurgeon]] who is able to keep his alter-ego in check through the use of an experimental [[sedative]]. Also, Jason suffers from [[dissociative identity disorder]] instead of developing a serum that separates the good and evil in a person.

* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by [[Stephen Fisher]] while [[Robbie Coltrane]] provides the voice of the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated Mr. Hyde. Like the version that was seen in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'', Mr. Hyde is also portrayed as a large, hulking brute. Van Helsing has pursued Hyde to [[Paris, France]] after having failed to capture him in an earlier confrontation in [[London, England]]. He is superhumanly strong and displays agility comparable to that of a [[great ape]]. While not invulnerable, he's extremely tough and sustains severe injuries that ultimately do little to impede or slow him down to any appreciable degree. Upon exchanging banter, they begin fighting in the bell tower of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] with Van Helsing initially gaining the advantage by severing Hyde's left arm at the [[biceps]], which regresses to a normal form after landing on the floor. Hyde rallies and assaults Van Helsing, using his right arm to hurl him through the roof of the cathedral. He then gloats before tossing Van Helsing off the roof only for Van Helsing to fire a grappling gun that sends the hook &amp; line through the center of Hyde's body, which Van Helsing uses to stop his fall. He attempts to pull Hyde off the roof, only for Hyde to begin pulling him upward, seemingly unfazed by the large hole in his body. Hyde trips over the edge of the roof, his falling weight pulling Van Helsing up to the roof before the line breaks. As it breaks, the momentum swings Hyde through the Rose Window of the cathedral and, while he falls, Hyde transforms back into the form of Henry Jekyll and dies from the fall. A [[police officer]] spots Van Helsing on top of the cathedral and holds him accountable for Dr. Jekyll's death. The novelization of the film portrays Hyde as not only a murderer, but a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] as well. The novel says the body of the murdered woman Van Helsing discovers on the streets of Paris as partially devoured while the same scene in the film shows the woman's body intact. However, the film does suggest that Hyde is cannibalistic when he encounters Van Helsing in Notre Dame and tells him &quot;You're a big one. You'll be hard to digest.&quot;

'''Tiffany &quot;Pennsatucky&quot; Doggett''' is a fictional character in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', portrayed by [[Taryn Manning]]. Manning was offered the role without needing to audition. The character of Doggett is based on a real life prisoner; a &quot;young woman from western [[Pennsylvania]] who proudly called herself a [[redneck]]&quot;. She is originally from [[Waynesboro, Virginia]]. Prior to her imprisonment, she is shown to be exchanging sexual favors for soda or money. Doggett is also known to have had five [[abortion]]s. She is charged with shooting an abortion doctor and decides to hire a [[Christianity|Christian]] lawyer; this leads to Doggett becoming a [[born-again Christian]]. 

Doggett makes her first appearance in the fifth episode of the first season and is initially an [[antagonist]]. In her debut episode, she unsuccessfully attempts to hang up a cross in the prison chapel and expresses [[homophobia|homophobic]] views. She has conflict with [[Alex Vause]] and [[Piper Chapman]] throughout the first season. In the second season, Doggett's storyline revolves around her friendships with [[List of Orange Is the New Black characters#Sam Healy|Sam Healy]] and Carrie &quot;Big Boo&quot; Black. This friendship with Big Boo continues into the third season. Big Boo comforts Doggett when she is feeling remorse for her abortions and when she is raped by a [[prison officer|correctional officer]]. The character of Doggett has received mixed reviews from critics, though Manning's performance has received positive feedback.

==Creation and casting==

Tiffany Doggett's nickname &quot;Pennsatucky&quot; is derived from [[Pennsyltucky]]; a pejorative term for the people from the rural western and central parts of [[Pennsylvania]]. The author, [[Piper Kerman]], of the book, ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]'',  which inspired ''Orange is the New Black'' describes the real life version of Pennsatucky as &quot;a young woman from western Pennsylvania who proudly called herself a redneck&quot;. Kerman further describes her as someone addicted to [[crack cocaine]] and dealing with the loss of custody of her child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/we_still_dont_know_how_to_talk_about_pennsatucky_the_reality_of_rural_sexual_assault_and_how_class_plays_out_in_orange_is_the_new_black/|title=We still don’t know how to talk about Pennsatucky: The reality of rural sexual assault and how class plays out in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;|last=Eisenberg|first=Emma|date=July 5, 2015|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=December 5, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029031434/http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/we_still_dont_know_how_to_talk_about_pennsatucky_the_reality_of_rural_sexual_assault_and_how_class_plays_out_in_orange_is_the_new_black/ |archivedate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of the first season of ''Orange is the New Black'', Doggett received some criticism from different media. Writing for ''[[The American Conservative]]'', B. D. McClay claimed that Doggett was a poor and inaccurate representation of American Christians; &quot;Pennsatucky is such an aggressively terrible character&quot; and &quot;her faith is neither well-understood nor well-drawn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmCon1&quot;/&gt; Laura Leonard of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', supports Clay's view and goes further to say &quot;it was frustrating to see this one painful narrative represent Christian faith on ''OITNB'', a show that masters other aspects of the melting pot so well&quot;, speaking about Doggett's background story and conflict with Chapman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2014/july/stereotypical-christians-of-orange-is-new-black.html?start=2|title=The Stereotypical Christians of 'Orange Is the New Black'|last=Leonard|first=Laura|date=July 21, 2014|work=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160811203356/http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2014/july/stereotypical-christians-of-orange-is-new-black.html?start=2|archivedate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two critics for ''[[The A.V.

Doggett's rape storyline in the third season garnered much reaction, both positive and negative.

Marissa Higgins, writing for [[xoJane]], contended that the show &quot;didn't accomplish anything with their portrayal of sexual assault&quot; and said that she disliked the way that the story ended with Doggett effectively quitting her job as van driver in order to avoid further contact with Coates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/orange-is-the-new-black-is-handling-sexual-assault-terribly|title=Actually, &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; is Doing a TERRIBLE Job of Portraying and Discussing Sexual Assault|last=Higgins|first=Marissa|date=July 10, 2015|work=[[xoJane]]|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093625/http://www.xojane.com/issues/orange-is-the-new-black-is-handling-sexual-assault-terribly|archivedate= March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma Eisenberg, of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', criticized the scenes depicting Doggett growing up in [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]] as being &quot;riddled with excessive [[Appalachia]]n clichés&quot;. She went further by calling Doggett's mother unrealistic in her attitude towards sex: &quot;the mothers I met [near Waynesboro] wanted their daughters to understand sex and to make informed choices&quot;. Eisenberg claimed that, therefore, Doggett's mother's speech about sex − &quot;it’s like a bee sting, in and out, over before you knew it was happening&quot; − was not representative of people in Waynesboro at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon1&quot;/&gt; Chloe Stillwell completely disagreed with Eisenberg and insisted that the character of Doggett was realistic: &quot;Eisenberg's argument completely misses the point that perhaps the show is trying to be as real as possible, and acknowledging that there are real life Pennsatuckies in this world isn't to disenfranchise Appalachia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-08/the-soapbox-on-pennsatucky-poor-white-rural-representation-on-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=The Soapbox: On Pennsatucky &amp; Poor, White, Rural Representation On &quot;Orange Is The New Black&quot;|last=Stillwell|first=Chloe|date=July 8, 2015|work=The Frisky|accessdate=August 11, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305023321/http://www.thefrisky.com/2015-07-08/the-soapbox-on-pennsatucky-poor-white-rural-representation-on-orange-is-the-new-black/|archivedate= March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==

===2012–2014===
Rob arrives in Weatherfield after being in prison and he seeks Carla's help to make a fresh start.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt; When Carla and Peter leave Weatherfield for Los Angeles, Rob steps in to help [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) run the factory. Shortly after Carla and Peter return for Christmas, Carla announces that she is going back to LA and selling the factory to the highest bidder. Knowing that he cannot find the money to make a bid, Rob decides to cook the books so the broker gives them a low valuation. When Carla returns for good, Rob and Michelle worry they will be caught out. Carla does find out and sacks Rob, threatening to report him for fraud. Rob goes into business for himself, stealing clients and orders from Underworld. Realising that she cannot beat Rob at his tricks, Carla offers Rob 30% share in the factory, much to Michelle's disliking. Rob begins dating [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]). Rob and Tracy currently stay at Number 1 Coronation Street with [[Deirdre Barlow]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) and own a shop, Barlow's Buys. The shop is where Barlow's Bookies used to be. After becoming engaged, Rob and Tracy embark on a series of illegal schemes, which are witnessed by [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Rob also discovers that Tina is having an affair with Peter behind a pregnant Carla's back. On the night of his engagement party, Rob visits Tina and asks her not to tell Carla about the affair, as it will ruin her happiness. Tina refuses and threatens to call the police and expose his scams. Rob chases her up to the balcony of the building yard and pushes her, causing her to lose her balance and fall onto the cobbles below. To Rob's horror, Tina survives the fall, however after Tina threatens to go to the police, Rob beats her with a metal pipe and she dies in hospital the following week.

Feeling guilty and angry at Peter for having an affair with Tina and breaking Carla's heart, he put a plan in action on framing Peter for Tina's murder. It seemed to work when he was sentenced to life, but after Carla told the police the truth, Rob fled Weatherfield. He asked Tracy to run away with him, but unbeknownst to him, she called the police herself and told them to come and arrest Rob. A devastated Rob disowned both Carla and Tracy, and gave himself up to the police. A month later, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.

===2015–2017===
Rob requests a visit from Tracy and tells his unnamed prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. After Tracy's visit, Rob requests a visit from [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] (Richard Hawley), and reveals that he is the father of Carla, as his mother shared the secret with him years ago.

In April 2017, during the investigation over who pushed [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) down the stairs, Tracy goes to the old gym where she meets a figure with a hood over its head,Tracey shouts out at the figure and then the figure steps forward and takes down the hood to reveal rob.

==Creation and development==
Rob is the estranged brother of [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt; Rob was originally named &quot;Darren&quot; and had previously been mentioned in the series and by cast and crew members during interviews.&lt;ref name=itvone/&gt;&lt;ref name=ones/&gt;&lt;ref name=kimy/&gt;&lt;ref name=luky/&gt; He was not in Carla's life as he was serving an eight-year stint in Strangeways prison for armed robbery.&lt;ref name=brother/&gt; In 2008, the serial's executive producer [[Kim Crowther]] told Kris Green from Digital Spy that her team had discussed the character. She said that there were no plans to introduce him, but it was likely that he would appear in the future.&lt;ref name=kimy&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Exclusive: Corrie's Producer Kim Crowther|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a132483/corries-producer-kim-crowther.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While King told Green that she imagined Carla's brother to be &quot;stunningly charming, but a complete minger inside&quot;. She explained that he was likely to be &quot;rough as old boots&quot; because they are from a &quot;really rough family&quot;. She added that Carla would have &quot;a brother who's absolutely brilliant with her&quot;.&lt;ref name=brother&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Corrie's Alison King talks Carla's brother|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a136646/corries-alison-king-talks-carlas-brother.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coronation Street'' fans later got the wrong impression that [[Luke Strong (Coronation Street)|Luke Strong]] ([[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]]) was Carla's brother.&lt;ref name=luky&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Poll: Is Luke the secret brother of Carla?|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a150178/poll-is-luke-the-secret-brother-of-carla.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, King told Green that she always expressed her interest in him joining the series but nothing came of it. She said that she would like him to come and live with Carla and &quot;get off with&quot; [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]).&lt;ref name=ones&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Kris|title=Corrie's Carla on men, exits and Daisy Mae|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a221570/corries-carla-on-men-exits-and-daisy-mae.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
In March 2012, the serial announced that their intention to introduce Rob and started the casting process. A ''Coronation Street'' representative said that they were going to see &quot;lots of different actors&quot; audition for the role. They also planned &quot;exciting storylines&quot; because fans had &quot;been keen to meet [Rob] for some time&quot;.&lt;ref name=itvone/&gt; A writer from itv.com said that Rob will &quot;turn heads and break hearts as the new moody bad lad of the Street&quot;. Rob will &quot;ruffle a few feathers&quot; and &quot;waste no time in setting his sights on some of ''Coronation Street's'' most eligible women&quot;.&lt;ref name=itvone&gt;{{cite web|title=The hunt for Carla's brother|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/thehuntforcarlasbrother/|work=[[itv.com]]|publisher=([[ITV Plc]])|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who auditioned for the role was [[Jamie Lomas]]; while actor [[Marc Bannerman]] also expressed his interest in the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Millar|first=Paul|title=Marc Bannerman wants 'Coronation Street' Carla brother role|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a377951/marc-bannerman-wants-coronation-street-carla-brother-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baylis was cast in the role and his casting was announced on 3 May 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MeetRob&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/carlasbrotherrobiscast/|title=Meet Carla's brother Rob|date=3 May 2012|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of joining the soap, Baylis said &quot;I feel incredibly honoured to be joining the very talented cast of ''Coronation Street''. Rob is an exciting character to play and I am hoping he is going to ruffle a few Weatherfield feathers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt; ''Coronation Street's'' producer [[Phil Collinson]] added that he was pleased to welcome Baylis to the cast and branded him &quot;the latest in a long line of handsome Corrie charmers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt; Collinson said Rob would &quot;set hearts fluttering&quot; and he soon develops a reputation as a ladies man, especially when he sets his sights on [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlasBrother&quot;/&gt; A writer for [[itv.com]]'s official ''Coronation Street'' website described Rob as &quot;a bit of a rogue with a twinkle in his eye&quot;, while Collinson called him a &quot;handsome bad boy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeetRob&quot;/&gt; When asked by Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly about the character's name, Collinson revealed that Darren is Rob's middle name and that Carla does not have another brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a398438/coronation-street-producer-phil-collinson-shares-gossip-and-teasers.html|title=Exclusive: 'Coronation Street' producer Phil Collinson shares gossip and teasers|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=9 August 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure and returns===
On 16 June 2014, it was announced that Baylis would be leaving his role as Rob towards the end of year and won't be being killed off. He will be leaving at the same time as Carla's husband, [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) so fans will be left wondering which man is punished for the murder of [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) - the crime that Rob committed.&lt;ref name=exit&gt;http://www.soapsquawk.co.uk/news/marc-baylis-leaving-coronation-street-.php&lt;/ref&gt; Baylis spoke about his exit, &quot;Chris and I are both leaving at the end of the year, around the same time. This is why we can't talk openly about it because it doesn't give anything away. It entices everyone a little bit more. We're trying to keep it as open as possible so it's fortunate that we are both moving on to pastures new.&quot;&lt;ref name=exit/&gt; Talking about his departure from the soap, he said, &quot;It is with a heavy heart that I move on, but it is an experience that I will treasure forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=exit/&gt;

In August 2015, it was revealed that Baylis would reprise the role of Rob later the same year, his return 'rumbled' the cobbles residents despite being in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a662367/coronation-street-spoilers-marc-baylis-is-returning-as-killer-rob-donovan.html#~pkGVbws9RRsmmM&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017 filming began for a second return stint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-spoiler-tracy-barlow-10020478&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antigoni Douka''' (previously '''Mavrakis''') is a [[fictional character]] on the [[ANT1]] television series ''[[Erotas]]'', played by [[Adamantia Kontogiorgi]].

==Characterization==
She is the [[villain]] of the series. She was the most important character to the show's development, and many of the storylines resulted from, or revolved around her character's actions in some way. She was kidnapped by [[Vera Douka]], and raised in the care of her mother in [[London]] at the age of four years, after witnessing her parents in a physical fight. She suffered [[psychology|psychological damage]] as a result, never being able to see her parents as her true parents when she returned home early in the first season, and always seeing Vera as her mother. After Vera's death, she became unstable, and her actions became much more erratic, and illegal, committing a series of malicious [[murder]]s. She eventually committed suicide in the final episode of the series, after being convicted of all crimes, and destroying any remaining family relationships that she had because she couldn't bear the thought of spending her life in jail.

'''Captain Ivan Drago''' ({{lang-ru|Иван Драго}}) is a fictional character in the 1985 film ''[[Rocky IV]]'', in which he is [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky Balboa's]] rival and the main [[antagonist]]. He is portrayed by [[Dolph Lundgren]]. Like the [[Clubber Lang]] character from ''[[Rocky III]]'', the character and his catchphrases have gone on to inspire multiple mentions in popular culture, including in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episodes &quot;[[Brian Goes Back to College]]&quot; and &quot;[[Something, Something, Something, Dark Side]]&quot;, the ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' episodes &quot;[[Chuck Versus the Final Exam]]&quot; and &quot;[[Chuck Versus the Anniversary]]&quot;, and the film ''[[Disaster Movie]]''. A poll of former heavyweight champions and prominent boxing writers ranked Drago as the third best fighter in the ''Rocky'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 19, 2013 |url=http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/18039/definitive-ranking-rocky-fighters/ |title=The Definitive Ranking of Rocky Fighters |publisher=Ruthless Reviews |date=2013-09-19 |accessdate=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional character biography ==
Ivan Drago is an [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist&lt;ref name=&quot;prop&quot;&gt;Michael J. Strada and Harold R. Troper. ''Friend or foe?: Russians in American film and foreign policy, 1933-1991'' (Scarecrow Press, 1997) ISBN 0-8108-3245-3&lt;/ref&gt; and an amateur [[boxing]] champion from the [[Soviet Union]], who had an amateur record of 100-1-0 Wins (100 KO). He is billed at 6&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in (196&amp;nbsp;cm) and 261 pounds (118&amp;nbsp;kg, over 18 ½ stone). He wields a punch yielding over 2000 [[Pound force per square inch|psi]], whereas the average psi for a boxer is 700psi.&lt;ref name=&quot;social&quot;&gt;William J. Palmer ''The films of the eighties: a social history'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1993) ISBN 978-0-8093-1837-7&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an infantry [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the [[Soviet Army]] and as seen on his chest, is a recipient of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award. Drago is carefully fitted and trained to be the consummate fighter. His heart rate and punching power are constantly measured via computers during his workouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychology&quot;&gt;Edward W. L. Smith ''Not just pumping iron: on the psychology of lifting weights'' (C.C. Thomas, 1989) ISBN 978-0-398-05544-8&lt;/ref&gt; Drago is seen receiving intramuscular injections in the movie, implied to be [[anabolic steroids]], though the actual nature of the injected solution is never explicitly stated.&lt;ref name=&quot;prop&quot; /&gt;

Drago is married to another athlete, Ludmilla Vobet Drago ([[Brigitte Nielsen]]), who is mentioned to be a double gold medalist in [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. She is much more articulate than Drago, who seldom talks, and always speaks on his behalf at press conferences and interviews.  She dismisses allegations of Drago's steroid use, explaining her husband's freakish size and strength by saying, &quot;he is like your [[Popeye]]. He eats his spinach every day!&quot;.

==Personality==
{{Original research section|date=September 2013}}
Unlike the flamboyant [[Apollo Creed]] and the brash [[Clubber Lang|James &quot;Clubber&quot; Lang]]—Rocky's opponents in previous films—Ivan Drago is quiet and non-boastful. Driven by his desire to be the best at all costs, this single-minded manner in which he pursues this goal deprives him of his humanity. Many viewers and critics have suggested that Drago was meant to symbolize America's perception of Russia: immense, powerful, and emotionless. This is made evident by his cold-blooded pulverization of Creed in an exhibition match as well as by his callous reaction towards news of his opponent's death. Drago generally allows his wife and trainers to talk on his behalf to the press. The character only speaks short sentences, throughout the film, all terse, short statements.

He speaks English four times in the film plus a few short words in the final round:

*''[To Apollo]'', &quot;You will lose.&quot;
*''[during victory speech]'', &quot;I cannot be defeated&quot; &quot;I defeat all man.&quot; ''(cut)'' &quot;Soon... I defeat real Champion.&quot; ''(cut)'' &quot;If he dies, he dies.&quot;
*''[To Rocky]'', &quot;I must break you.&quot;
*''[To Rocky]'', &quot;To the end.&quot;
*''[To Rocky]'', (Small phrases in the final round) &quot;Come On!&quot;. &quot;Fight!&quot;. &quot;Fight!&quot;.
And Russian twice (not including short phrases, e.g. &quot;[[:wiktionary:привет|привет]]&quot; or &quot;[[:wiktionary:давай|давай]]&quot;):

*''[To his trainer in Russian&lt;!-- after phrase &quot;You see. He's [Ivan Drago] not a machine. He's a man. --&gt;]'', &quot;Он не человек, он как кусок железа.&quot; (&quot;He's not human, he's like a piece of iron.&quot;)
*''[To his informant and the Soviet politburo]'', &quot;Я бьюсь за победу! Для себя! Для себя!&quot; (&quot;I fight to win! For me! For me!&quot;)

==Plot==
In ''[[Rocky IV]]'', Drago's trainers, Sergei Igor Rimsky (George Rogan) and Manuel Vega (James &quot;Cannonball&quot; Green), along with his wife Ludmilla ([[Brigitte Nielsen]]), are convinced that he can defeat any boxer. Drago enters professional heavyweight boxing in the beginning of the movie, as stated by the press. Former champion [[Apollo Creed]] ([[Carl Weathers]]), now 42 years old, comes out of retirement to challenge Drago to an exhibition match, promoted by Creed's former rival [[Rocky Balboa]] ([[Sylvester Stallone]]). Creed arrives to the ring wearing his signature [[Flag of the United States|Stars &amp; Stripes]] boxing garb to &quot;[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]],&quot; sung by [[James Brown]], dancing upon a huge stage that is lowered into the ring. Before the match begins, Drago mutters &quot;You will lose.&quot; During the fight, Apollo is no match for the Russian fighter.  Drago even continues to attack Creed after the bell is rung to end the round, despite this being an exhibition match instead of a professional one. In Apollo's corner, Rocky contemplates whether to [[submission (combat sport)|throw in the towel]] and surrender the fight (against Creed's earlier instructions), but instead he decides to hold onto the towel. Defenseless, Apollo continues to absorb blows to the head until Drago finally kills him with a final blow to the head. Drago exhibits no remorse about what happened to the former champion, simply stating in an interview after the fight that &quot;if he dies, he dies.&quot; To avenge Apollo's death, Rocky travels to the Soviet Union to fight Drago on his home turf in [[Moscow]].  The fight eventually becomes a long, drawn-out war between Rocky and Drago, and to everyone's shock, Rocky manages to severely damage Drago, and the crowd begins to cheer for Rocky, whereas at the start of the fight, they were hostile to him. Drago's promoter — a Soviet/[[East Germany|German]] official — insults him, claiming that by allowing an American to fight so admirably on Russian soil, Drago is disgracing the Soviet Union. The enraged Drago grabs him by the throat, throws him out of the ring and proclaims he only fights for himself. Rocky defeats Drago by KO in the 15th and final round in a dramatic ending.

In ''[[Rocky V]]'', it is revealed that the pain Drago inflicted on Rocky left Rocky with brain damage (specifically diagnosed as [[cavum septi pellucidi]] (CSP)), causing him to mistake people, see visions and various other things. During Rocky's fight with Tommy Gunn, Rocky sees visions of Drago killing Apollo while believing he is about to suffer the same fate at Tommy's hands, until a vision of Mickey inspired him to get up and defeat Tommy.

According to ''Rocky: The Ultimate Guide'', Ivan Drago was not permitted to resume his boxing career after his loss to Rocky Balboa because of the special circumstance that he could not officially turn pro in the USSR. Drago turned professional after the fall of the Soviet Union and accumulated a record of 31-0 (31 KO) while also winning a portion of the Heavyweight title. He never unified the title or fought the very top contenders (as a professional) because of promotional politics.

In 2015, the title ''Drago''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=3&amp;ti=1,3&amp;Search%5FArg=Drago&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=o3REJEUD2qpATwqZ5bTVorKFunnO&amp;SEQ=20161122111607&amp;SID=1|title=Drago}}&lt;/ref&gt; was registered by LeMay Industries, LLC and copyright was given by the United States Copyright Office. The author, Andrew LeMay, is a citizen of the United States. According to the document, both text and characters were taken from two copyrights. The first titled ''Communist Boxing Redemption Movie'' , the second titled ''Rocky IV''.

==Cultural impact==
Commentaries on Drago often characterize him as a hyperbolic representation of [[Russia]]n power in the context of the latter part of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Christina|title=Lock and Load(up): The Action Body in The Matrix|journal=Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies|year=2005|volume=19|issue=4|page=560|doi=10.1080/10304310500322909}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lukynov&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukynov|first=Fyodor|title=America as the Mirror of Russian Phobias|journal=Social Research|year=2005|volume=72|issue=4|pages=859–872|jstor=40971800}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbolism is particularly clear in some lines in the film, like the radio announcer who says, &quot;Ivan Drago is a man with an entire country in his corner.&quot;&lt;ref name=Strada&gt;{{cite book|last=Strada|first=Michael J.|title=Friend Or Foe?: Russians in American Film and Foreign Policy, 1933-1991|year=1997|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810832453|page=157|author2=Troper, Harold R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have characterized Drago in contrast to Rocky, the prototypically American hero, and that Drago's defeat represents a crumbling of the [[U.S.S.R]].{{sfn|Strada|1997|p=158}}

Some, however, have noticed Drago's individualism. Toward the conclusion of the movie, when Drago is confronted by a Communist Party functionary, this fighter from the collectivist USSR screams at the top of his lungs, &quot;I fight to win FOR ME!! FOR ME!!!&quot; Drago wants to win, but not for the crowd, not for the nation, not for the communist party, not for the Politburo. He wants to win for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/783/rocky-iv-the-misunderstood-ivan-drago/|title=ROCKY IV - THE MISUNDERSTOOD: IVAN DRAGO - Ruthless Reviews|work=Ruthless Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Washington Times]]'' referenced Ivan in a comparison of the American–Soviet Olympic rivalry of the Cold War: &quot;[[Nationalism]] makes the Olympics worth watching. [[Jingoism]] makes them worth caring about.&quot; ''The Times''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Patrick Hruby noted that without an embodiment of the rivalry like Ivan Drago, the Olympics were not as fun.&lt;ref name=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120915222.html | title=Where Have You Gone, Ivan Drago?

'''Dwight''' is a [[fictional character]] in the comic book series ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'' portrayed by [[Austin Amelio]] in the [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|television series of the same name]]. Dwight is second in command to a group of survivors led by [[Negan]] called &quot;The Saviors&quot; who extort nearby communities for their supplies in exchange for protection against zombies, but Dwight despises Negan for holding his wife Sherry over him and becomes an uneasy ally of [[Rick Grimes]] as a double agent against Negan. After Negan's defeat, Dwight becomes the new leader of the Saviors and incorporates them into the trade-route arrangement between the other communities. In the television series, Dwight, Sherry and her sister, Tina, flee the Saviors, fed up with Negan's reign of terror. They encounter [[Daryl Dixon]], who helps them escape but Dwight betrays Daryl, stealing his crossbow and his motorcycle. Since then, a violent hostile rivalry has been formed between Dwight and Daryl.

== Appearances ==
===Comic book series===
Before the outbreak Dwight served in the military and was married to Sherry, and was possibly a hunter due to his accuracy with a cross bow. After the outbreak occurred Dwight and Sherry took up residence in the Sanctuary community led by Negan, but Dwight and Sherry struggled to maintain their keep due to Negan's high expectations. However, Negan offered Dwight and Sherry easier lives if Sherry became one of his many wives; she reluctantly agreed though this would mean that Dwight would never be allowed to so much as speak to her again. One night they violated their agreement and Negan had Dwight's face burned with an iron as punishment, and from then on Dwight pretended to hate Sherry, openly calling her bitch, to make her think he did hate her although he resented himself for doing so. Eventually Dwight joined Negan's army of &quot;zombie exterminators&quot; offering protection to the nearby Hilltop Colony and The Kingdom communities in exchange for half of their supplies weekly, threatening them with violence if they didn't comply, and Dwight served as Negan's right-hand man.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

====Something To Fear====
After [[Rick Grimes]] kills several Saviors, refusing to partake in their arrangement, Dwight is sent by Negan to make example of those who refuse him. After finding Rick's home in the Alexandria Safe-Zone, Dwight attempts a failed ambush against them and is injured. In retaliation Negan himself goes after Rick while he travels to Hilltop and sends Dwight and 50 other Saviors back to attack Alexandria but Andrea is able to kill at least a dozen of them and forced the rest to retreat, but Dwight is captured and held in the underground bunker. Andrea wants to kill Dwight for murdering Abraham and almost killing Eugene but Rick plans to consent to Negan's terms and releases Dwight so he won't anger Negan anymore than he already has. As Dwight leaves however it's revealed that Rick has tasked [[Paul &quot;Jesus&quot; Monroe|Jesus]] to follow Dwight back to his community.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

====What Comes After====
As Dwight walks back home he notices movement on the bridge above him but fails to see Jesus following him and shrugs it off but another Savior crosses his path and informs Dwight he's been followed, but is informed that John and Tara have captured Jesus. Despite resistance Tara manages to have him restrained and Dwight demands Jesus to be taken back alive and throw him into their truck but as they approach the Sanctuary Jesus manages to escape unnoticed. Dwight demands the other saviors not to tell Negan and Dwight is present for Negan's return from Alexandria much to Negan's surprise as he'd believed him killed in the Alexandria and expresses disappointment that he isn't dead, much to Dwight's anger. When [[Carl Grimes]] attacks them having snuck aboard the truck Dwight viciously beats the child in anger until Negan stops him, having taken a liking to Carl earlier, and later Dwight witnesses Negan ironing Mark's face for sleeping with Amber who is now married to Negan and looks on with sympathy. When Amber tries to reach out to Mark, Dwight stops her and Sherry comforts her but as she tries to talk to Dwight he calls her a bitch and tells her to shut up but as Sherry walks away heart-broken Dwight appears engulfed in rage. Dwight later witnesses Negan's ping-pong tournament and afterward deliberately drags Sherry away to have sex with in front of Dwight. Finally having enough Dwight approaches [[Ezekiel (The Walking Dead)|Ezekiel]] of The Kingdom and offers his assistance against Negan and Ezekiel contacts Rick and Jesus to meet with them, but Rick immediately distrusts him for killing Abraham but Dwight is surprised to see Rick show up at all as he assumed he'd fallen victim to Negan's intimidation. Rick doesn't believe Dwight to be a defector and tries to convince Ezekiel that Dwight is a spy who's trying to uncover their plan to rebel against Negan, but Dwight informs Rick about Sherry and that Negan would have killed her if he didn't kill Abraham but Rick eventually punches Dwight in the face. After Ezekiel stops them coming to further blows Dwight explains that Sherry chose to become Negan's wife in order to make their lives easier, and they didn't realize how much they needed each other until then and the one time they were caught together is when Negan burnt his face. Dwight admits he committed terrible acts for Negan he can't make up for out of cowardice but insists he can help the leaders end Negan's reign of terror and offers them everything he knows about Negan, even if Rick doesn't trust him he asks to trust that his information will see Negan dead.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

====All Out War====
After the milita of the communities led by Rick, Jesus and Ezekiel attacks the Sanctuary Negan orders Dwight to rally a counterattack and agrees but deliberately hesitates to give Rick more time to, as planned, kill enough Saviors and to lure any zombies nearby. Though the plan succeeds Holly is captured by Negan who he believes is Rick's girlfriend, unaware it's Andrea he actually needs, but she reminds him she was with Abraham and looks at Dwight with disdain. Dwight later helps Negan and some other saviors clear out zombies trying to get into the Sanctuary and later, reluctantly, takes part in Negan's counterattack on Alexandria. First using a zombified Holly as a Trojan horse which kills Denise Cloyd and then begins throwing grenades into the safe-zone but orders the saviors to spread out, since they will be easier targets. After Jesus manages to toss one of the grenades back Dwight tells a group of saviors to hold the grenades longer so they can't be tossed back but as they start panicking Dwight grows tired and shoots them all. Jesus sees this and still acts suspicious of Dwight but he again insists he is on their side. Dwight is later present with Negan and Carson after Eugene is captured and demands Eugene start building bullets for them rather than Rick but he refuses. After Negan and Carson leave Dwight sneaks back into Eugene's cell and tries to convince him of his arrangement with Rick so Eugene doesn't give into Negan's demands but Eugene doesn't believe him and accuses him of playing both sides and that if he had defected he would have put a knife through Negan's head while asleep, but Dwight insists that he is going to kill Negan when the time is right and not when there are too many people who'd kill him for his betrayal. Before he can continue both men notice Carson watching them but shows support for Dwight's actions as he desires to get back to Hilltop to be with his brother Harlan Carson, and that others are against Negan too. Negan later orders all his men to soak their bladed weapons and arrow heads in zombie corpses so anyone stabbed, regardless if they survive will be killed by the infection. After forcing the Alexandria and Kingdom residents back to Hilltop Negan launches an attack on the colony where Dwight is forced to kill some members of the communities but after sneaking up on Rick, Negan orders Dwight to kill Rick. Although he hesitates Dwight shoots Rick in his lower back but Dwight secretly switches one of his zombie coated arrowheads for a normal one so Rick won't be infected. After falling back Negan camps close to Hilltop and Dwight joins him near a fireplace where Negan is happy with excitement, believing Dwight shot Rick with an infected arrow, and believes Rick will be dead soon and the militia crippled. The next day the saviors line up outside Hilltop's gates where Rick alone emerges to talk to Negan, enraged that Dwight didn't kill him, and he manages to deceive Negan with talks of consenting to the arrangement before slitting his throat. As Rick and Negan fight Dwight orders the saviors to stay back allowing the other community members to open fire on them and Dwight drops his cover and begins firing on other saviors, even saving Ezekiel from one. After Negan passes out from blood loss and Rick from exhaustion Dwight reveals his alliance with Rick to the community members, and declares himself the new leader of the saviors and orders them to stand down. Though resistant Dwight insists they don't have to fear Negan anymore and can live peacefully with the other communities and they consent to his leadership.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

====Life and Death====
In the two years since Negan's defeat Dwight has incorporated the Saviors into the trade-route arrangement with the communities but has become stressed with the heavy burdens of leadership, and he and Sherry have divorced but still remain close friends. When delivering a share of supplies from the Sanctuary to Alexandria Dwight approaches Rick and asks to speak to him and confesses that it was necessary for him to take leadership during the war, but feels unfit to lead anymore. Rick tells him to discuss it with the residents of the Sanctuary and hold an election.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

====No Turning Back====
After 12 members of all 4 communities are murdered by The Whisperers the Saviors head back to the Sanctuary but Laura suggests Dwight stay behind and assist Rick, but he confides in her that he doesn't want to be leader anymore, but Laura insists that his people need him now more than ever and can't quit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Walking Dead'' #149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
After the outbreak occurred, Dwight, Sherry and her sister-in-law Tina and two teenagers named Carla and Delly were forced into the forest to escape a large group of walkers, but Carla and Delly were separated from them. Sherry set fire to the forest to kill all the walkers within it but this indirectly resulted in Carla and Delly's deaths. The three later came into contact with The Saviors led by [[Negan]], a group of survivors who extorted other communities into giving them supplies by force and were offered protection in exchange for their service which they agreed, but came to see that Negan was a tyrant. They eventually grew resentful of &quot;kneeling&quot; and the three, along with a truck full of supplies named Patty, escaped from the community. However men were sent to find the four and ambushed them on a road 20 miles away from the [[Alexandria Safe-Zone]], and were separated from Patty.

====Season 6====
In the episode &quot;[[Always Accountable]]&quot;, Dwight, Sherry and Tina ambush [[Daryl Dixon]], mistaking him for part of the group they just left, and Dwight threatens to kill him if he tries anything. Daryl tries to convince Dwight he is not who they think he is but they do not believe him. They tell Daryl they are not going back to the community, and Daryl is their insurance in case they are found while they look for Patty(a fuel truck). Eventually they find an abandoned factory overrun with walkers and deduce that Patty must have been taken. Tina faints and Daryl steals their supplies and runs, but after learning Tina is diabetic he returns with the supplies. Shortly after a group led by Dwight tells Wade he is not going back but Wade demands he and the girls give back everything they took. Daryl helps them escape, and lures another man, Cam, into a walker trapped in a tree that bites his arm. After Wade amputates he is called off and they return to their home and Dwight realizes Daryl is not with the group. They find a greenhouse where they find out that Delly and Carla were killed, but the two girls emerge as walkers and kill Tina. As Dwight and Daryl bury them, Daryl invites Dwight and Sherry to come back to Alexandria. On impulse he holds Daryl at gunpoint and demands his crossbow which he reluctantly hands over. Dwight and Sherry also take his bike and leave him behind, and Sherry says she is sorry, but Daryl simply says &quot;you're gonna be&quot;.

Dwight returns in the episode &quot;[[Twice as Far]]&quot;, sporting his signature half-burnt face. While Daryl, Rosita, and Denise are on a supply run, Dwight shoots Denise through the back of the head with Daryl's crossbow and emerges with a group of Saviors and the captured Eugene. Dwight then demands that Daryl and Rosita take him and his Saviors back to their home base, but they refuse. Daryl then coldly tells Dwight that he should have killed him back in the burnt forest. Suddenly, Eugene bites Dwight's testicles and Abraham emerges from the bushes and kills many of Dwight's Saviors, resulting in a firefight between Daryl's group and Dwight's group. However, Dwight and the Saviors manage to escape. In the episode &quot;[[East (The Walking Dead)|East]]&quot;, Daryl leaves Alexandria to avenge Denise's death and kill Dwight. but Glenn, Michonne and Rosita chase after him to stop him. While Glenn and Michonne are separated from Daryl and Rosita they are ambushed by Dwight and captured and used as bait to lure Daryl and Rosita out. As Daryl realizes the deception Dwight appears and shoots him in the back but says &quot;You'll be alright&quot;. In the season finale &quot;[[Last Day on Earth (The Walking Dead)|Last Day on Earth]]&quot;, Dwight brings Daryl, Michonne, Glenn and Rosita into the middle of a route between Alexandria and Hilltop where Negan has Rick, Carl, Maggie, Abraham, Sasha, Eugene and Aaron. As Negan addresses the group for the recent attacks on his people he considers killing Maggie due to her ill health but Glenn tries to charge Negan, and Dwight tackles him and threatens to kill him if he tries that again. Dwight then watches as Negan kills Abraham.

====Season 7====
In the season premiere &quot;[[The Day Will Come When You Won't Be]]&quot;, Dwight witnesses Negan kill [[Abraham Ford]] who was in the line-up captured by the Saviors in the woods. Because his rival [[Daryl Dixon]] tries to intervene, he is stopped by Dwight who asks [[Negan]], &quot;Do you want me to do it?&quot; and Negan spares Daryl, wanting to convert him to his cause. [[Glenn Rhee]] is then killed by Negan too, because of Daryl's revolt. This has a major impact on Daryl's mental state, because he feels responsible for his death. Dwight is ordered by Negan to throw Daryl into a van, and Negan and the Saviors leave, but issue a warning that they'll show up at the Alexandria Safe-Zone in one week to collect their debt.

The episode &quot;[[The Cell (The Walking Dead)|The Cell]]&quot;, opens showing Dwight on an average day in the Sanctuary as he watches television, plays ping pong and makes an elaborate sandwich from the Sanctuary garden, showing his high position with the Saviors. He is later shown giving Daryl unpleasant food in his cell while tormenting him with loud music at night to stop him from getting any sleep. It is shown that Negan is tasking Dwight with breaking Daryl so he can become one of them. He then offers Dwight the chance to sleep with Sherry or any of his other wives, but Dwight turns him down. Shortly after, Dwight volunteers to bring back a runaway Savior named Gordon to try to impress Negan, but his motorcycle is damaged after an encounter with walkers near an overpass. Once he finds Gordon, he tells him to keep walking back towards the Sanctuary, but after Gordon continually begs him not to take him back, Dwight shoots him in an act of mercy. Negan later reveals to Daryl that Dwight, his wife Sherry and her sister Tina ran away with medical supplies before returning. Negan was going to kill Dwight, but Sherry offered to marry him if he spared Dwight's life. While Dwight was allowed to live and return to the Saviors, his face was burned with an iron as punishment though he has since become one of Negan's &quot;top guys.&quot; When Daryl still refuses to submit, Dwight throws him back in his cell, telling him he'll either end up working for Negan or on the walker fence. Daryl responds with telling Dwight he understands why he knelt as he was thinking about someone else which is why he can't kneel. The episode ends with Dwight staring at the reanimated Gordon on the fence in deep contemplation of his life choices.

In the episode &quot;[[Service (The Walking Dead)|Service]]&quot;, Dwight shows up with the Saviors at the Alexandria Safe-Zone for tribute. While his people gathered up the offerings, Dwight demanded Rosita give him Daryl's motorcycle, though he later tells Daryl it's his whenever he wants; he just has to say the word.

Dwight later reappears in &quot;[[Sing Me a Song (The Walking Dead)|Sing Me a Song]]&quot; when [[Carl Grimes]] arrives at the Sanctuary to kill Negan. Dwight disarms Carl and holds him at gunpoint, but Negan admonishes him for treating a guest that way. He is later seen while Negan is with Sherry and watches with visible discomfort when Negan burns a Savior named Mark who broke the rules. He is later shown discussing with Sherry how she gave up Mark. Sherry denies that's what happened before Dwight tells her whatever helps her sleep. When she asks him how he sleeps, he responds that he doesn't and instead watches TV until morning. When she remarks that their return to the Saviors was only supposed to affect them, Dwight disagrees, stating &quot;If you're still standing in this world, it's on someone else's back&quot; before she departs. In &quot;[[Hostiles and Calamities]]&quot;, Dwight discovers that Daryl is gone and quickly finds a note written to Daryl. He is then attacked by several Saviors on Negan's orders and find himself back in a cell. Negan later informs him that Sherry is gone and asks him if he's loyal. When Dwight professes his innocence, Negan allows him to go after Sherry. He then goes to a house that they promised to meet at if they got separated and finds a note apologizing to him for everything that has happened and saying goodbye. He is distraught by her absence, but hangs on to her ring and leaves a message for her there. He returns to the Sanctuary and plants the note in Dr. Emmett Carson's office. This causes Negan to kill Carson, believing he let Daryl go, before apologizing to Dwight for doubting him. The episode ends with Dwight conversing with [[Eugene Porter|Eugene]] as the two acknowledge that they are still themselves, not Negan. At the end of the episode [[Something_They_Need|&quot;Something They Need&quot;]], it's revealed Dwight found Rosita outside the Sanctuary and she brought him back to Alexandria. He's placed in a cell until Rick arrives. Daryl attempts to attack him, but Rosita claims he wants to help, something he confirms to Rick. [[The_Walking_Dead_(season_7)#Episodes|&quot;The First Day of the Rest of Your Life&quot;]] opens with Rick holding Dwight at gunpoint; [[Tara_Chambler|Tara]] advocates killing him as justice for his murder of Denise. Dwight claims he didn't intend to kill her, before being pinned against a wall by Daryl who holds a knife to his eye. Dwight states he's sorry for what happened, but he can help them beat Negan. After Daryl releases him, Dwight reveals Negan is coming to Alexandria the next day with a convoy of Saviors. He states he can slow them down so they can prepare; once they kill Negan and those with them, Dwight can lead them back to the Sanctuary and they can take over, putting an end to the threat. He leaves Alexandria and saws down several trees to blockade the path between Alexandria and the Sanctuary. The next day, Dwight is forced to watch things devolve into all-out battle between Rick's allies and the Saviors. After the Saviors retreat, Daryl finds a message from Dwight, claiming he didn't know that would happen.

'''''Edward Scissorhands''''' is a 1990 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Dark Fantasy|dark fantasy film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]], produced by [[Denise Di Novi]] and Tim Burton, and written by [[Caroline Thompson]] from a story by Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson, starring [[Johnny Depp]] as an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation who has scissor blades instead of hands. The young man is taken in by a [[suburb]]an family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim ([[Winona Ryder]]). Additional roles were played by [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Kathy Baker]], [[Vincent Price]] and [[Alan Arkin]].

Burton conceived ''Edward Scissorhands'' from his childhood upbringing in suburban [[Burbank, California]]. During [[pre-production]] of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', [[Caroline Thompson]] was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at [[20th Century Fox]], after [[Warner Bros.]] declined. ''Edward Scissorhands'' was then [[wikt:fast track|fast tracked]] after Burton's critical and financial success with ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. The majority of filming took place in Lakeland, Florida between March 10 and June 10, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Names in the News |author= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=04Y_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WlUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6979,1941688&amp;dq=johnny-depp&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Portsmouth Daily Times |date=March 25, 1990 |accessdate=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and [[film score]] composer [[Danny Elfman]].

The leading role of Edward had been connected to several actors prior to Depp's casting: a meeting between Burton and the preferred choice of the studio, [[Tom Cruise]], was not fruitful, and [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tom Hanks]] turned down the part. The character of The Inventor was devised specifically for Vincent Price, and would be his last major role. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by [[Stan Winston]].

''Edward Scissorhands'' was released to positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the [[Academy Award]]s, [[British Academy Film Award]]s, [[Saturn Award]]s, as well as winning the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. Both Burton and Elfman consider ''Edward Scissorhands'' their most personal and favorite work.

==Plot==
An elderly woman tells her granddaughter a bedtime story of where snow comes from, by telling her the story of a young man named Edward who has [[scissors|scissor blades]] for hands. As the creation of an old Inventor, Edward was a human-like boy who was in the penultimate stage of work. The Inventor homeschooled Edward, but suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] and died just as he was about to fasten hands on Edward.

Some years later, Peg Boggs, a local [[Avon Products|Avon]] door-to-door [[salesperson|saleswoman]], visits the decrepit [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] mansion on the hill where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone, and though he is initially startled, Peg offers to take him to her home when she realizes he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. They are initially fearful of Edward but come to see him as a kind person and allow him to stay.

The Boggs' neighbors are all curious to their new house guest, and the Boggs decided to throw a neighborhood barbecue to welcome Edward. There, most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. After the barbecue, Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into beautiful [[Topiary|topiaries]]. This incidentally leads him to discovering he can craftfully trim and style dogs' hair, and later as a hair stylist for many of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, suggests that she can help Edward open a hair salon and charge money for his unique talent. While scouting for a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, leaving Edward scared, though Joyce tells the other neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, affecting their trust of him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan for the salon, having no background or financial history.

Jim, jealous of Kim's growing attraction to Edward, suggests Edward help pick the lock on his parents' home to acquire a van for himself and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, the burglar alarm goes off, and Jim flees, leaving Edward to be caught by the police. The police find through psychological examination that his period of isolation has left him with no sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes full responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the rest of the neighborhood except for the Boggs.

During the Christmas holiday, Edward carves an angelic [[ice sculpture]] modeled after Kim, the ice shavings being thrown into the air and falling like snow, a rarity in this area. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, which surprises him and he accidentally cuts Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, tells him she is breaking up with him. Edward runs off during the argument in a fit of rage, destroying some of his works until he is calmed down by a stray dog. Meanwhile, Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to try to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries to apologize for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward is afraid he will hurt her again. Jim returns in a drunken rage, and nearly runs over Kevin with a truck, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, though also inadvertently scratches him. Jim encourages those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries to attack Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion when the police arrives.

Kim races after Edward, while Jim obtains a handgun and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes and confronts Edward; who refuses to fight back until Jim slaps Kim when she attempts to intervene. As Kim gets up, Edward attempts to protect her, but Jim tells him to get away from her. Enraged, Edward angrily stabs Jim in the stomach and violently shoves him out of a high window, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward, giving him a kiss, before she departs. As the police and neighbors gather at the mansion, Kim states that both Jim and Edward fought and fell to their deaths, and brandishes one of the spare scissor blades as proof of Edward's death, but since Edward is actually still alive (he was actually on the top floor on his mansion), and the spare scissor blade Kim brandished was not from Edward, it's revealed that Kim lied to everyone. The neighbors return home.

The elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because decades have passed and she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She believes that Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the winter &quot;snow&quot; that Edward creates by carving ice sculptures that scatter shavings over the neighborhood. The movie finishes with Kim saying &quot;sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.&quot;

==Production==

===Development===
The genesis of ''Edward Scissorhands'' came from a drawing by then-teenaged director [[Tim Burton]], which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. &quot;I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why.&quot; During [[pre-production]] of ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', Burton hired [[Caroline Thompson]], then a young novelist, to write the ''Edward Scissorhands'' screenplay as a [[spec script]]. Burton was impressed with her short novel, ''First Born'', which was &quot;about an [[abortion]] that came back to life&quot;. Burton felt ''First Born'' had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in ''Edward Scissorhands''.&lt;ref name=Burbank/&gt; &quot;Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal&quot;, Thompson remarked.&lt;ref name=concept/&gt; She wrote ''Scissorhands'' as a &quot;[[love poem]]&quot; to Burton, calling him &quot;the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Donna Foote; David Ansen | title = The Disembodied Director | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 1991-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Thompson's hiring, Burton began to develop ''Edward Scissorhands'' at [[Warner Bros.]], with whom he worked on ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' and ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the [[film rights]] to [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = John Evan Frook | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR105853 | title = Canton Product at Colpix starting gate | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-04-13 | accessdate = 2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox agreed to finance Thompson's screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control. At the time, the budget was projected to be around $8–9 million.&lt;ref name=cut&gt;{{cite news | author = Frank Rose | title = Tim Cuts Up | work = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] | pages = 42–47 | date = January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; When writing the storyline, Burton and Thompson were influenced by [[Universal Horror]] films, such as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954), as well as ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) and various [[fairy tale]]s. Burton originally wanted to make ''Scissorhands'' as a [[musical film|musical]], feeling &quot;it seemed big and operatic to me&quot;, but later dropped the idea.&lt;ref name=personal/&gt; Following the enormous success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Burton arrived to the status of being an [[A-list]] director. He had the opportunity to do any film he wanted, but rather than [[wikt:fast track|fast track]] Warner Bros.' choices for ''[[Batman Returns]]''&lt;ref name=Burbank&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.84–88&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Beetlejuice]] Goes Hawaiian'', Burton opted to make ''Edward Scissorhands'' for Fox.&lt;ref name=fantasy&gt;{{cite book | author= Edwin Page | title = Gothic Fantasy: The Films of Tim Burton | publisher =[[Marion Boyars Publishers]] | year =2007 | pages =78–94 | isbn = 0-7145-3132-4 | chapter = Edward Scissorhands | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Although [[Winona Ryder]] was the first cast member attached to the script,&lt;ref name=personal/&gt; [[Dianne Wiest]] was the first to sign on. &quot;Dianne, in particular, was wonderful&quot;, Burton said. &quot;She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested&quot;.&lt;ref name=hedge&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.89-94&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered;&lt;ref name=&quot;armitage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/feature/a776892/25-things-you-probably-never-knew-about-edward-scissorhands-on-the-films-25th-anniversary/|title=25 amazing Edward Scissorhands facts on the film's 25th birthday|last=Armitage|first=Hugh|date=December 12, 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|access-date=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with [[Tom Cruise]]. &quot;He certainly wasn't my ideal, but I talked to him&quot;, Burton remembered. &quot;He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up&quot;.&lt;ref name=hedge/&gt; Cruise asked for a &quot;happier&quot; ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Chris Hewitt | title = Tom Cruise: The alternative universe | pages = 67 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = 2003-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tom Hanks]] turned down the part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/facts-you-didnt-know-about-edward-scissorhands-60500836/|title=10 Sharp Facts You Didn't Know About ''Edward Scissorhands''|date=December 7, 2015|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|access-date=May 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter in favor of critical and commercial flop ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]''.&lt;ref name=Easton&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-12/entertainment/ca-1092_1_tim-burton |first=Nina J |last=Easton |title=For Tim Burton, This One's Personal|website=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-08-12|accessdate= 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldman declined as he found the story absurd, but said of the finished film: &quot;Literally two minutes in, I went, 'Yeah, I get it'. I just got it too late.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Kevin Costner &amp; Gary Oldman|series=Larry King Now|series-link=Larry King Now|network=[[Ora TV]]|date=April 15, 2016|minutes=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Carrey]] was also considered for the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Jim Carrey|date=17 March 2011|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey/|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Thompson favored [[John Cusack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armitage&quot;/&gt; Elsewhere, [[William Hurt]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and musician [[Michael Jackson]] expressed interest,&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt; although Burton neglected to converse with Jackson.&lt;ref name=&quot;armitage&quot;/&gt;

Though Burton was unfamiliar with [[Johnny Depp]]'s then-popular performance in ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', he had always been Burton's first choice.&lt;ref name=hedge/&gt; At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting to break out of the [[teen idol]] status which his performance in ''21 Jump Street'' had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp &quot;wept like a newborn&quot; and immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Johnny Depp]] | title = Burton on Burton| publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] |year=2005 | pages = ix–xii |chapter=Foreword| isbn = 0-571-22926-3 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the role, Depp watched many [[Charlie Chaplin]] films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Johnny Depp on his inspiration for Edward Scissorhands | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = May 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20035285_20035355_20039648_1,00.html | accessdate = 2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox [[studio executive]]s were so worried about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Giselle Benater | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318853,00.html | title = Cutting Edge | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1990-12-14 | accessdate = 2008-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref name=hedge/&gt; [[Drew Barrymore]] previously auditioned for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bernard Weinraub | title = The Name Is Barrymore But the Style Is All Drew's | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1993-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crispin Glover]] auditioned for the role of Jim before [[Anthony Michael Hall]] was cast.&lt;ref name=cut/&gt;

[[Kathy Baker]] saw her part of Joyce, the neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy.&lt;ref name=personal/&gt; [[Alan Arkin]] says when he first read the script, he was &quot;a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to me until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary&quot;.&lt;ref name=personal&gt;{{cite news | author = Nina J. Easton | title = For Tim Burton, This One's Personal | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 1990-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of The Inventor was written specifically for [[Vincent Price]], and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', the two became good friends. [[Robert Oliveri]] was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] from [[The Backstreet Boys]] was an uncredited casting as the blond boy playing on the [[Slip 'n Slide]] when Edward was riding in Peg's car through suburbia.&lt;ref&gt;DVD production notes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Burbank, California]] was considered as a possible location for the [[suburb]]an neighborhoods, but Burton believed the city had become too altered since his childhood&lt;ref name=hedge/&gt; so the [[Tampa Bay Area]] of [[Florida]], including the town of [[Lutz, Florida|Lutz]] and the Southgate Shopping Center of [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] was chosen for a three-month [[shooting schedule]].&lt;ref name=concept&gt;Hanke, p.97-100&lt;/ref&gt; The production crew found, in the words of the [[production designer]] [[Bo Welch]], &quot;a kind of generic, plain-wrap suburb, which we made even more characterless by painting all the houses in faded pastels, and reducing the window sizes to make it look a little more paranoid.&quot;&lt;ref name=hands/&gt; The key element to unify the look of the neighborhood was Welch's decision to repaint each of the houses in one of four colors, which he described as &quot;sea-foam green, dirty flesh, butter, and dirty blue&quot;.&lt;ref name=color/&gt; The [[facade]] of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] mansion was built just outside [[Dade City, Florida|Dade City]]. Filming ''Edward Scissorhands'' created hundreds of (temporary) jobs and injected over $4 million into the Tampa Bay economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Joe Frank | title = Lights Camera Action Big Bucks | work = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1990-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production then moved to a Fox Studios [[sound stage]] in [[Century City, Los Angeles, California|Century City, California]], where interiors of the mansion were filmed.&lt;ref name=hands&gt;{{cite news | author = Laurie Halpern Smith | title = Look, Ma, No Hands, or Tim Burton's Latest Feat | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1990-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create Edward's scissor hands, Burton employed [[Stan Winston]], who would later design the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s [[prosthetic makeup]] in ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; Depp's wardrobe and [[prosthetic makeup]] took one hour and 45 minutes to apply.&lt;ref name=teen&gt;{{cite news | last=Collins|first=Glen| title = Johnny Depp Contemplates Life As, and After, 'Scissorhands' | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1991-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The giant [[Topiary|topiaries]] that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant sprigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Frank|first=Joe| title = Something's Strange in Suburbia | work = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1990-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Heinrichs]] worked as one of the [[art director]]s.

===Music===
''Edward Scissorhands'' is the fourth feature film collaboration between director [[Tim Burton]] and composer [[Danny Elfman]]. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Larry Rohter | title = Batman? Bartman? Darkman? Elfman | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1990-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman cites ''Scissorhands'' as epitomizing his most personal and favorite work. In addition to Elfman's music, three [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] songs also appear:  &quot;[[It's Not Unusual]]&quot;, &quot;Delilah&quot; and &quot;With These Hands&quot;. &quot;It's Not Unusual&quot; would later be used in ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996), another film of Burton's with music composed by Elfman.&lt;ref name=Danny&gt;[[Danny Elfman]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 1998, [[20th Century Fox]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Burton acknowledged that the main themes of ''Edward Scissorhands'' deal with self-discovery and isolation. Edward is found living alone in the attic of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] castle, a setting that is also used for main characters in Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. ''Edward Scissorhands'' [[climax (narrative)|climaxes]] much like [[James Whale]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and Burton's own ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. A mob confronts the &quot;evil creature&quot;, in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. ''Edward Scissorhands'' is a [[fairy tale]] book-ended by a prologue and an epilogue featuring Kim Boggs as an old woman telling her granddaughter the story,&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; augmenting the [[German Expressionism]] and [[Gothic fiction]] archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Graham Fuller | title = Tim Burton and Vincent Price Interview | work = [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] | date = December 1990 | pages = 110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton explained that his depiction of suburbia is &quot;not a bad place. It's a weird place. I tried to walk the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It's a place where there's a lot of integrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=color&gt;Hanke, p.101-105&lt;/ref&gt; Kim leaves her [[jock (stereotype)|jock]] boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton's revenge against jocks he encountered as a teenager in suburban [[Burbank, California|Burbank, CA]]. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a &quot;high school fantasy&quot;.&lt;ref name=jock&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.95-100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Box office===
[[Test screening]]s for the film were encouraging for [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], then president of the company, considered marketing ''Edward Scissorhands'' on the scale of &quot;an ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]''-sized [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]],&quot; but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. &quot;We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe,&quot; he reasoned.&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, p.107-116&lt;/ref&gt; ''Edward Scissorhands'' had its [[limited release]] in the United States on December 7, 1990. The [[wide release]] came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. ''Edward Scissorhands'' eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=edwardscissorhands.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-12-02 | title = Edward Scissorhands}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote &quot;the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film [[teen idol]] potential, drawing younger audiences.&quot;&lt;ref name=teen/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Edward Scissorhands'' received acclaim from critics and audiences. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that the film holds an 89% approval rating, based on 56 reviews, with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads: &quot;The first collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is a magical modern fairy tale with gothic overtones and a sweet center.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands (1990)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/edward_scissorhands/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 77 (out of 100) based on 19 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be &quot;generally favorable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/edward-scissorhands|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave the film a &quot;A-&quot; grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CinemaScore – Edward Scissorhands|url=http://www.cinemascore.com/|work=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' praised the piece by stating, &quot;Burton's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year's most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy.&quot; He continued by praising Depp's performance stating, &quot;Depp artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it's a terrific performance&quot; and the &quot;engulfing score&quot; from Danny Elfman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/edward-scissorhands-19901214|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=14 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff  of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' spoke highly of the film, &quot;Director [Burton] takes a character as wildly unlikely as a boy whose arms end in pruning shears, and makes him the center of a delightful and delicate comic fable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: ‘Edward Scissorhands’|url=http://variety.com/1989/film/reviews/edward-scissorhands-1200428433/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=31 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Lee of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' scored the film five out of five stars, writing, &quot;Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.&quot; whilst additionally adding praise to Depp's performance, &quot;[Depp] is sensational in the lead role, summoning anxiety, melancholy and innocence with heartbreaking conviction. And it's all in the eyes: his dialogue is cut-to-the-bone minimal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands, review: 'a true fairytale'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11298442/Edward-Scissorhands-review-a-true-fairytale.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, &quot;Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Edward Scissorhands'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/edwardscissorhandspg13howe_a0b2c5.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=14 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' granted the film praise, &quot;Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin.&quot; She too praised Depp's performance in stating, &quot;... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Edward Scissorhands'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/edwardscissorhandspg13kempley_a0a0bf.htm|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=14 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an &quot;A-&quot; rating and praised it in &quot;The romanticism has a personal dimension – for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light.&quot; He also commented very positively on character of Edward, &quot;... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far.&quot; Of Depp he wrote, &quot;Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but what he does is tremulous and affecting.&quot; As well as Eflman's score of the piece by saying it to be, &quot;[A] lovely, storybook score highlights the pop romanticism of Burton's conception. The romanticism has a personal dimension.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318762,00.html|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=7 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, &quot;Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Scissorhands (1990)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2D81338F934A35751C1A966958260&amp;partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Burton cites ''Edward Scissorhands'' as epitomizing his most personal work.&lt;ref name=fantasy/&gt; The film is also Burton's first collaboration with actor Johnny Depp and [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] Stefan Czapsky. In October 2008, the [[Hallmark Channel]] purchased the television rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Daniel Frankel; Mike Flaherty | title = BET, Hallmark pact for pics | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metal]] band [[Motionless in White]] have a song entitled &quot;Scissorhands (The Last Snow)&quot;, with its lyrics written about the film in homage to its legacy and impact on the [[gothic subculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Track-By-Track: Motionless in White|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/track-by-track_motionless_in_white/|publisher=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish indie rock band [[The Twilight Sad]] named a mini-album ''[[Here, It Never Snowed.

'''Mr. Eko Tunde''' is a [[fictional character]], played by [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]].'' He is introduced in the [[Lost (season 2)|second season]] episode &quot;[[Adrift (Lost)|Adrift]]&quot; as one of the plane-crash survivors from the plane's tail section. Flashbacks reveal that he became the leader of a gang of guerrillas to save his brother when he still lived in [[Nigeria]]. He assumed his brother's identity and became a priest after his brother was killed in a botched drug smuggle; Eko killed two guerrillas in defense, was ostracized, and left Nigeria to become a priest in Australia. After investigating the alleged miracle of a girl who came back to life after drowning in Australia in 2004, Eko boarded Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. This plane crashed and left Eko, along with a few other survivors, on a deserted island.

''Lost'' creators [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Carlton Cuse]] were fans of Akinnuoye-Agbaje's work on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', and asked him to portray the character. Although Akinnuoye-Agbaje was not initially interested in joining the cast, he was persuaded by Cuse and Lindelof, but for a shorter period than they had in mind. Akinnuoye-Agbaje had a lot of influence on his character, changing the character's name and making adjustments to Eko's personality. After appearing on the show for one season, Akinnuoye-Agbaje asked Cuse and Lindelof to write his character out of the show because he did not feel at home in Hawaii. They decided a &quot;shocking and emotional death&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGdeath&quot;/&gt; would be the best way for the character to depart: after seeing his brother on the island, Eko chases him until he stumbles upon the [[Man in Black (Lost)|smoke monster]], which brutally murders him.

Mr. Eko received many positive responses from critics and fans, who were disappointed that the character was killed after one season. A toy figure of Mr. Eko was included in a second series of ''Lost'' toy figures distributed by [[McFarlane Toys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-02-06-lost-action-figure_x.htm|title=Another 'Lost' action figure sails into view|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Keck, William|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===Prior to the crash===
Originally from [[Nigeria]], Mr. Eko was born on January 31, 1968. He grew up always looking after his younger brother, Yemi ([[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]]), with whom he lived in a small village.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot; /&gt; As revealed in &quot;[[The 23rd Psalm]]&quot;, one day, when Eko is playing with the local children, a gang of guerrillas raids the village in search of young recruits.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot; /&gt; When Yemi refuses to shoot an elderly man, Eko steps in and shoots him himself, sparing Yemi from the same fate.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot; /&gt; Impressed by his actions, the guerrillas take Eko away with them and draw him away from his religious lifestyle and into the criminal life, where Eko adopted the title &quot;Mr.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot; /&gt; He grows up to be a fearless drug lord and a vicious leader of a guerrilla group, while his brother becomes an honoured priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatyouneedtoknow&quot; /&gt; Years after his abduction, Eko returns to his home village to ask Yemi to help him smuggle heroin, which Eko has hidden in a large number of [[Virgin Mary]] statues and intends to fly out of the country.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot; /&gt; Yemi refuses until Eko threatens his associates will burn the church down if he does not sign documents that allow him and his henchmen to appear as priests.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = The 23rd Psalm | episodelink = The 23rd Psalm | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Matt Earl Beesley]] (director); [[Damon Lindelof]] &amp; [[Carlton Cuse]] (writers) | network = ABC | airdate = 2006-01-11 | season = 2 | number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Eko and his men assemble at the airfield on the day the shipment is ready to be smuggled, it is revealed Yemi has tipped off the military and now tries to convince Eko not to go through with his plans.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot;/&gt;  When the military arrives, Yemi is killed in the ensuing gun battle and Eko is kicked off the plane.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot;/&gt; After the plane leaves, Eko is mistaken for Yemi and released back to his village.&lt;ref name = &quot;The 23rd Psalm&quot;/&gt; Feeling guilty over Yemi's death, Eko assumes his role as the village priest.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Cost of Living&quot;/&gt; One day, Eko encounters a gang of guerrillas who made a deal with Yemi: they'll take 80% of the vaccines delivered to the village in exchange for the village's safety.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Cost of Living&quot;/&gt; Soon afterward, the guerrillas arrive at the church and attempt to cut off Eko's hands. However, Eko fights back and kills them, much to the shock of the village. The church is thus boarded up and Eko is ostracized until he leaves for London.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Cost of Living&quot;/&gt;

After leaving England, Eko assumes his brother's identity, serving as a priest in Australia under the name Father Tunde. A monsignor asks him to investigate a reported miracle of a young lady who has come back to life after drowning.&lt;ref name = &quot;?&quot;/&gt; The girl's father, Richard Malkin, dismisses the miracle as an act of incompetence by the undertaker, claiming the girl was suffering from severe hypothermia and the doctor misdiagnosed her as a result.&lt;ref name = &quot;?&quot;/&gt; Eko soon prepares to board Oceanic Airlines Flight 815; shortly after buying a ticket, he encounters the girl whom the investigation is about.&lt;ref name = &quot;?&quot;/&gt; She tells Eko  she saw Yemi as she was &quot;between places&quot;, and his brother had a message for him to have faith.&lt;ref name = &quot;?&quot;/&gt;

===After the crash===
After the crash, Eko lands with the tail-section survivors in the ocean, a short distance from the beach.&lt;ref name = &quot;The Other 48 Days&quot; /&gt; On the group's first night on the island, the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] kidnap a few of the survivors.

{{cquote|What you see on the screen now is something quite different from what was originally talked about. As I understood it, from what we discussed with the creators, he was actually quite a passive character. The name that we initially came up with was 'Emeka', and I changed the name to 'Eko', because it is [[Yoruba name|Yoruba]], which is the tribe that I come from, and I added the 'Mr.'... I've had some difficulty trying to establish the character with the writers. Y'know, because we were trying to marry what they wanted to do with the show and feelings that I wanted to see come out in the character...'The 23rd Psalm', perhaps, was a bonding point for me as an actor with the writers, so it really was a formulation of a trust between us.

'''Elixir''' ('''Joshua''' &quot;'''Josh'''&quot; '''Foley''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 2 #5 and was created by [[Nunzio DeFilippis]], [[Christina Weir]], and [[Keron Grant]]

==Fictional character biography==
Josh Foley's powers first manifest during his time as a member of the anti-mutant group the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. His powers initially go unnoticed by the other Reavers, and he uses them to save fellow mutant [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie Collins]]. Outed as a mutant, and thrown out of his house by his parents, Josh reluctantly joins the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] and becomes [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]]'s roommate.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #5-6&lt;/ref&gt; His parents sign [[legal guardianship]] over to [[Dani Moonstar]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #7&lt;/ref&gt;

A depowered [[Rahne Sinclair]] visits the [[X-Mansion]]. Josh is instantly smitten by the new &quot;wild child&quot; Rahne,&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt; and sneaks out of the Institute at night to go to a bar where Rahne is playing [[billiards|pool]]. A connection is established between them as Josh shows an immediate understanding of her inner struggle. As the two kiss, Josh unconsciously restores Rahne's powers. She loses control and mortally wounds Josh.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM10&quot;&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie witnesses the attack and uses her pheromone powers to drive away Rahne.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #11&lt;/ref&gt; While he is rushed to the mansion's infirmary, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reveals the full potential of Josh's power: he can manipulate all the body's functions on a genetic level, and the fact that Josh only heals is simply inexperience. With [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], the mansion's other healer, absent, the residents resort to electrically shocking Josh awake so that he can heal himself. As an unexpected [[side effect]], Josh turns his skin and hair to a reflective gold color.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM12&quot;&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 2 #12&lt;/ref&gt; He is assigned to Dani's New Mutant squad and given the codename Elixir.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men: Academy X'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahne attempts to end her relationship with Josh after she becomes a teacher at the school, but Josh is persistent and they continue to see each other secretly. However, when Rahne witnesses him on a date with Laurie, she ends the relationship. Josh is depressed at first, but eventually realizes that it was for the best and pursues a relationship with Laurie. However, [[Wither (comics)|Wither]] also has a crush on Laurie, and reveals Rahne's and Josh's previous relationship to the school.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men: Academy X'' #4-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the New Mutants team ostracize Elixir for his involvement with a teacher.  Eventually, the New Mutants squad's in-fighting begins to affect their ability to act as a team. Concerned with the future of her team, [[Wind Dancer]] convinces everyone to get together for a [[camping|camp-out]] so they can work through their issues with one another.  The evening ends with Josh speaking candidly with [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]] about his disappointment over his own actions. The other members of the team overhear and he is reconciled with David and Laurie.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men: Academy X'' #11-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men: Academy X – Yearbook Special'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimation and Childhood's End===
[[Image:Elixirdark.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Elixir kills Stryker]] 
The events of [[House of M]] leaves only 27 students with their powers, including Josh. Fearing their safety, [[Emma Frost]] orders the depowered students and staff, including Josh's guardian Danielle Moonstar, to leave the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #20-22&lt;/ref&gt; A bus full of depowered students is bombed by anti-mutant zealot Reverend [[William Stryker]], killing all on board. Josh is unable to heal his dying classmates in time, and becomes severely depressed and loses confidence in his abilities. Most of the remaining students take part in a melee fight organized by Emma Frost to determine who will be members in the new group of mutant heroes in-training, the [[New X-Men]]. Despite his non-combat powers, Josh makes the team.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Caught up in his emotions over the deceased students, Josh hits a powered-down [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] over the head with a metal beam during a training session. Furious, Emma temporarily kicks him off the team. Afterwards, Laurie is killed by a bullet fired by one of Stryker's agents.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #25&lt;/ref&gt; Enraged over the death of Laurie, Josh uses his power to kill Stryker.  This turns Josh's golden skin into metallic black and leaves him catatonic.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[X-23]] is mortally wounded and unable to heal during the final battle with Nimrod, [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]] rushes her back to the Institute with help from Emma Frost, who unlocks the part of his brain which controls his powers. Julian gives a motivational speech and gets Josh to move forward with his life. Josh heals Laura, which also turns his skin back from black to gold.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #31&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after it is discovered that a small part of black still remains on Josh's skin, moving from place to place. Josh states he could still kill but he will need to learn how to control his powers and use them only to heal.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #32&lt;/ref&gt; He approaches Beast and asks him to teach him everything there is to know about [[human anatomy]], [[physiology]], and [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Elixirknowledge.JPG|thumb|Right|250px|Elixir gains Beast's advanced expertise in human biology from the Stepford Cuckoos.]] 
Before the other students are teleported to Limbo, the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] help Elixir learn advanced science by taking information from the Beast's head and putting it into Josh's. This increases his power exponentially, allowing him to heal otherwise-fatal injures with a touch. He also masters his &quot;black abilities&quot; by being able to switch instantly from golden/healing to black/disease-causing.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #37-41&lt;/ref&gt; He begins a romantic relationship with [[Loa (comics)|Loa]].&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #43&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Force===
Due to Elixir being a &quot;problem&quot; to X-Force, X-23 contacts the Stepford Cuckoos to help Rahne and erase Elixir's memories of the team, by Josh's request. However, before his memories can be erased, X-Force is interrupted and sent on a mission. Elixir joins X-Force and receives a dark-colored uniform. He helps his new team capture Vanisher, creating a deadly brain tumor on his brain. Elixir later keeps X-23 from killing herself after she becomes infected with the Legacy Virus, and helps her get rid of it.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #7-10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elixir is transported to the future, along with the rest of X-Force, by Cyclops in order to bring Cable and the mutant child back to the present. Once they arrive there Elixir is in a hysterical state over being unable to save his friends from the [[Leper Queen]]. When Vanisher is wounded by Deadpool, Josh heals him and later is led to Cable and Hope Summers.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force/Cable: Messiah War'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in the future, Vanisher constantly tries to get Elixir to undo his tumor only to be turned down.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #14&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in the present, Josh cures Nori and Julian but falls into a coma as a result of the strain. He is later sought out by [[Hrimhari]] when Wolfsbane collapses after a battle with the Frost Giants.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #17-20&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving on Utopia, Hrimhari makes a deal with the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] goddess of death, [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], when he finds out Rahne is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #22&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to choose between his lover or his child to save, Hrimhari requests Hela heal Josh so that he can save Wolfsbane and their child. Elixir heals her by transferring some of her baby's strength to her to ensure that she can survive the pregnancy. He and X-Force teleport off to Genosha and once there he informs Vanisher that it's not the tumor making him sick as he removed it in their trip to the future but his stage 4 Syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Elixir faces off against Wither in a fight to the death. Elixir shifts to his black form, then reverses the effects of Wither's powers, telling Kevin he is sorry before turning him to dust. In the aftermath of Necrosha, Wolverine states that Josh has quit the team, citing he is having difficulty shifting out of his black form.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolverine Legacy===
In the aftermath of the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' storyline, Elixir was captured by the same individuals that had captured X-23, Sabretooth, Daken, Lady Deathstrike and Mystique. As he was still stuck in his black form, he was unable to attempt to rouse Mystique after Sharp knocked her unconscious with the trigger words, however this proved to be unnecessary as Mystique had already recovered and was just feigning unconsciousness. When Siphon attacked the group shortly after, Elixir tried to use his killing powers to stop him, however these had no effect and Josh was quickly overwhelmed. X-23 insisted that they needed to help, but Sabretooth refused and demanded Sharp release them. Sharp, his team, and the captives then scattered to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopians===
Elixir later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Madison Jeffries]], [[Masque (comics)|Masque]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], and [[Tabitha Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;''All-New X-Men'' #40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and Resurrection ===
Elixir later resurfaces, having joined a church group to help find himself, when he's tracked down by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[M (comics)|M]] who felt he might be targeted by someone killing mutant healers. While there, the group is attacked by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], and most of the church volunteers are slaughtered.  While M and Sabretooth are busy fighting the Riders, Josh begins healing the volunteers en masse, but it was a trap to lure him out and he is shot and killed by [[Gauntlet (Inhuman)|Gauntlet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 4 #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet as it turns out, because of the nature of Josh's powers, he did not remain dead for long, regenerating in his grave before making his way back to Genosha. Emotionally and mentally unstable as a result of his experiences, he tested his expanding powers by torturing the Dark Riders, resurrecting them and killing them over and over again. Magneto and his team discovered his survival and tracked him down, eventually taking him to one of the medical centers where mutants were being treated for M-Pox. Josh was able to completely heal the mutants there, but the rush of destroying the disease ravaging him led him to nearly drain the life from the human medical personnel, and then the X-Men when they tried to stop him. Fortunately they were able to reach and stop him. Josh was taken to Xorn's retreat, in hopes the mutant could help Josh come to terms with the tragedies, and gain control of his powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual (Vol 4)'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards he was approached by Exodus and together both traveled to the Savage Land where Magneto had been stabbed by Psylocke in a deadly way and left alone to die a slow and painful death. As Elixir heals Magneto anew he declines their invitation to join them, and tells them he must remain &quot;dead&quot; for the sake of mutantkind. Elixir and Exodus then teleported to parts unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men (Vol 4)'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Elixir is an [[Omega-level mutant]], capable of controlling the biological structure of any organic matter including his own body.&lt;ref name=&quot;NM12&quot;/&gt; He must be in proximity to whomever he uses his power on. Besides healing, he is capable of boosting and restoring mutant abilities,&lt;ref name=&quot;NM10&quot;/&gt; causing painful boils and welts to appear, curing the Legacy Virus,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10&lt;/ref&gt; and cleansing the body of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol. 3 #3&lt;/ref&gt; and later after his powers were expanded radically he can even cure the M-Pox. 
The [[Stepford Cuckoos]] telepathically copied and transferred the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s knowledge of anatomy, biology, and genetics into Josh's mind, allowing him the knowledge to heal virtually any malady.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #38&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his control over his own biology, Elixir has proven to be very difficult to treat medically.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #28&lt;/ref&gt; He usually passes out after pushing his powers too far and remains in a coma for some time and although he can be killed, his powers grant him the ability to resurrect himself. He can even regenerate on a cellular level. 

Since his rebirth, Elixir can bring people back from dead to the point that Josh is now able to affect the 16 millions deceased mutants on Genosha at once, and although it quickly drained him out of energy and he passed out, Monet and Magneto speculated, that Elixir was fully capable of resurrecting them all.

He is also able to detect abnormalities in living beings: he detected techo-organic cells in Angel's body, detected Emplate in Monet's body and even sensed the effect of magical inversion on Sabretooth. When Josh started to cure the M-Pox he felt that the disease was afraid of him.

==Other versions==
===New X-Men: Too Much Information===
When David learns of a mental block within his head that prevents him from keeping the information he absorbs permanently, he asks for Emma Frost's aid in removing it. Working with Dani Moonstar, they show David a possible future outcome because of the mental blocks' removal. After leaving the Xavier Institute, David promises to help Josh find the full potential of his powers. Months later after establishing his own business, Josh is used to create a  cure to both cancer and AIDS. Although successful, it comes at the cost of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men: Academy X'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Josh was an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], serving alongside Agent Kevin Ford ([[Wither (comics)|Wither]]) as interrogator. Foley and Ford were in charge of &quot;persuading&quot; [[Cameron Hodge]], a member of the Human Liberation Front, to reveal the location of his terrorist cell. Josh uses his power to &quot;speed up the body's biological functions,&quot; and combined with Agent Ford's power, they are able to create a net effect that causes a part of the terrorist to die and then [[Regeneration (biology)#In fiction|regenerate]], which Foley describes as &quot;quite painful&quot;. Before Ford and Foley begin torturing Hodge, Agent Noriko Ashida ([[Surge (comics)|Surge]]) interrupts them, prompting Ford and Foley to attack her. She incapacitates them both but Foley manages to use his power to rupture her blood vessels and cause her lungs to fill with blood.

==In popular culture==
* Elixir is referenced in the [[MC chris]] song, &quot;Nrrrd Grrrl&quot;: &quot;She's more like a wallflower, Like the one that Stryker sniped, I'm like Elixir when I'm with her, 'Cause I think I like her type.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Chris. &quot;Nrrrd Grrrl.&quot; Lyrics. ''mc chris is dead.'' mc chris LLC, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===

====''A Storm of Swords''====
Ellaria comes with Oberyn to King's Landing, as part of [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s efforts to win them to the Iron Throne. Oberyn, however, clearly wants revenge for his relatives' deaths, apparently on the orders of [[Tywin Lannister]], during King Robert's rebellion.{{Sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Chapter 38: Tyrion V}} Oberyn wants Ellaria to sit with him at [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s wedding, causing trouble when Olenna Tyrell calls her &quot;the serpent's whore&quot;. Later, when Tyrion is condemned for poisoning Joffrey Baratheon, Oberyn acts as his champion in a Trial by Combat against Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], who had raped and murdered Oberyn's sister Elia Martell, during the Sack of King's Landing. Oberyn wounds Gregor with a poisoned spear but is killed by Gregor. Afterwards, Ellaria returns to Dorne.

====''A Dance with Dragons''====
Gregor Clegane apparently dies of the poison after spending days in agony (Oberyn having treated the poison to work slowly). His skull is sent to Dorne, where Oberyn's brother Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, sees it. Despite Gregor and Tywin's deaths Oberyn's bastard daughters want revenge. Ellaria argues against revenge, saying all those they want revenge against are dead and the Lannisters they are now targeting took no part in their kin's deaths. She reminds them Oberyn died for trying to avenge his relatives' deaths and worries they will get killed if they try to get vengeance for him, and will draw her daughters into the cycle of revenge. Doran sends her back to her father Lord Harmen Uller of Hellholt with her youngest daughter Loreza Sand.{{Sfn|''A Dance With Dragons''|loc=Chapter 38: The Watcher}}

===TV Series===
[[File:Indira Varma.jpg|right|thumb|English actress Indira Varma portrays Ellaria Sand.]]
====Season 4====
Ellaria Sand's storyline is very similar to her storyline in ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''.

====Season 5====
Ellaria goes to [[Doran Martell]], Prince of Dorne and Oberyn's brother, to try to persuade him to take revenge for his brother's death. However, Doran refuses, as Oberyn's death was caused by [[trial by combat]], and therefore by Westerosi law, [[Gregor Clegane]] did not murder Oberyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/20/game-of-thrones-the-house-of-black-and-white-review|title=Game of Thrones: &quot;The House of Black and White&quot; Review|last=Fowler|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 19, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellaria soon realises after this that [[Jaime Lannister]] is sailing for Dorne, and Ellaria presumes correctly that Jaime is planning to rescue [[Cersei Lannister]]'s, and Jaime's, daughter Myrcella, who is in Dorne and betrothed to Doran's son [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]]. When Jaime arrives at the Water Gardens, a residence of House Martell where Myrcella and Ellaria and situated, the Sand Snakes, Oberyn's bastard daughters, one of which is Ellaria's daughter, attack Jaime and Bronn, acting under orders of Ellaria. However, the skirmish ends when Jaime, Bronn, the Sand Snakes and Ellaria are all arrested by the Martell guards. Soon after this, Doran and Jaime reach a deal where Trystane will still marry Myrcella, but the two will live in King's Landing and Trystane will be granted a seat on the Small Council. Ellaria is threatened with death by Doran if she ever defies him again and she feigns allegiance to him. She kisses Myrcella goodbye at the docks, secretly wearing lipstick coated with a slow-acting poison, which kills Myrcella on the ship headed for King's Landing.

====Season 6====
After Doran Martell realises that Myrcella has been murdered, Ellaria stabs Doran, while in King's Landing Obara and Nymeria Sand, who had snuck onto the ship headed to King's Landing, kill Trystane. This makes Ellaria de facto ruler of Dorne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatculture.com/tv/game-of-thrones-season-6-10-ups-and-2-downs-from-the-red-woman|work=What Culture |title=Game Of Thrones Season 6: 10 Ups And 2 Downs From 'The Red Woman' |accessdate=December 1, 2016 |date=April 25, 2016 |last=Hunt |first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A while later, Ellaria meets [[Olenna Tyrell]], whose son and grandchildren have been killed by Cersei, now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

'''Emplate''' ('''Marius St. Croix''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #1, and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Chris Bachalo]]. Emplate would serve as one of the major [[antagonist]]s to the ''Generation X'' comic book series during its run.

==Fictional character biography==
Emplate was born '''Marius St. Croix''', the brother of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X's]] [[M (comics)|M]] (Monet) and the [[M-Twins]] (Nicole &amp; Claudette). When his mutant powers first manifested, his sisters were disgusted, especially Monet. In retaliation, Marius somehow turned Monet into the [[Muteness|mute]] and [[diamond]]-skinned [[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]]. With their sister missing, Nicole and Claudette turned to Marius for answers, blaming him for her supposed death. They opened a dimensional portal to imprison Marius; afterwards, he called after Penance to join him, saying that only he could cure her. She followed after him and became his slave and &quot;dinner&quot; until the events of ''Generation X'' #1. The twins panicked and decided that they would pose as their missing sister so that their parents would not be angry (as they thought that Monet was their favorite child). It was in these roles that the characters would be introduced to readers.

===Encounters with Generation X===
In this other dimension, Marius was under extreme torture by some unknown beings, and traversing between dimensions was characterized as a thousand hands ripping at his flesh. Due to this torture, Marius had to acquire a [[respirator]] to aid in his breathing.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; Still he had to feed, and, fueled on by the marrow of the captive Penance, Emplate would periodically travel to our plane of reality. In one of these trips he encountered [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and tried to feed off of his powerful energy signature, but Generation X arrived in time to save him. When they returned to the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], the team found Penance passed out on their lawn. She had been shuttled by the enigmatic [[Indigenous peoples|Aborigine]] mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]], whose only word to the confused team was &quot;Penance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Emplate later assembled a team to torment Generation X that included '''[[Murmur (Marvel Comics)#Murmur (Hellions)|Murmur]]''', '''[[Bulwark (comics)|Bulwark]]''', '''[[Vincente (comics)|Vincente]]''', and his usual underling '''D.O.A.'''. In an uncharacteristic move, Emplate also recruited a human: [[Gayle Edgerton]], Chamber's ex-girlfriend who Chamber had unintentionally paralyzed when his powers first manifested. Emplate offered her a chance for revenge, turning her into one of his vampiric minions. They were successful in capturing the young mutants, but with the help of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and Penance switching sides they were successful in stopping the team. During the confrontation, Emplate revealed that Monet was his sister, causing Generation X to grow wary of her. Though Emplate was defeated, he still transformed [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] into one of his minions, and transported Synch to his home of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to attack his family and friends. The girls of Generation X followed him, and with their help Synch was able to remember his humanity and fight the hunger within him, releasing him from Emplate's thrall.&lt;ref&gt;Generation X #12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===M-Plate===
Changing the roster a bit, Emplate plotted to harm the team again, this time working with [[Chimera (comics)|Chimera]] and her minions.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #33&lt;/ref&gt; His timing was very inopportune, as Monet had been knocked unconscious and had split back into the twins.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #31&lt;/ref&gt; They awoke from their [[coma]]s to see their brother standing over them, and, recognizing that he was in pain, attempted to help him. The twins rejoined into their M form and then grabbed a hold of their brother and joined with him also, forming an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamated]] being calling itself M-Plate. This form had aspects of both forms, but also displayed new powers and new malevolent plans.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

M-Plate traveled to a place on the edge of Time called the [[Citadel]] of the Universal Amalgamator, which was a weapon of vast power that could merge every individual consciousness into a giant &quot;godhead&quot;. Wishing to control every conscious being, M-Plate set to use the weapon, but failed in her/his attempts. The being was split apart when the mutant rat [[Dirtnap (comics)|Dirtnap]] swallowed her/him and began to digest him/her. The digestion process forced the three beings to separate and attempt to escape (individually and in pairs). The stress of the escape attempt caused Dirtnap to explode but also restored the twins and Emplate to their separate forms. Emplate was quickly dispatched by Banshee.&lt;ref&gt;''Generation X'' #36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emplate's Hellions===
[[Image:M and the fam.jpg|thumb|left|Monet, Cartier, and Marius taken from Generation X #58 written by Jay Farber and Darrick Robertson]]
Emplate once again tried to capture Penance, this time with a new group of &quot;Hellions&quot;. Their ranks consisted of '''Wrap''' another mummified mutant whose body was made of raw energy which increased his strength, Vincente who now had the ability to change the chemical composition of his vaporous form, a female named '''Nocturne''' who could release psionic bolts of energy which disrupt the central nervous system of her targets or destabilize molecular bonds in inorganic materials, and the ubiquitous D.O.A. Despite their new roster, their attempts failed. In the process, Emplate and his minions battled Generation X. [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] blew up Proudstar Hall which caused the [[M-Twins]] to be knocked free from the Penance body, and Emplate to be knocked unconscious.

===Beyond M-Day===
Since the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], where the [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered 90% of the mutant population, Emplate has retained his powers.

Emplate reappears on the former site of the Xavier Institute, where he kills a few construction workers currently working on the site. He later reappears on Utopia and after watching [[Madison Jeffries]] and [[Danger Room#Sentience revealed|Danger]], he attacks them; after taking out Danger, he manages to sample Jeffries. The X-Men arrive and after defeating them he fades back to his reality. There he reveals to D.O.A. that Penance is no longer with them but from the information he gathered from Jeffries, he sets his sights on Bling.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy Annual'' #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Emplate captures Bling! and brings her to his dimension. After a brief struggle with Bling!, Emplate proceeds to feed upon her, causing her to pass out. After talking to D.O.A. and feeling his tormentors approaching, Emplate prepares to feed again so he may survive his next encounter with them. He enters Bling!'s prison and after Bling! manages to get a bit of his backstory, he feeds on her again and goes to his tormentors telling them to feast and be damned.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #228&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rogue comes after Emplate trying to rescue Bling!, D.O.A. sends some vicious creatures to attack and kill her. He informs Emplate of Rogue's rescue attempt and he decides to kill Bling! in case the X-Men are tracking him through her. Rogue escapes the creatures and teams up with Bling! in a surprise attack on him when he tries to feed on her one last time.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #229&lt;/ref&gt; During the fight, Rogue and Emplate absorb each other's powers and continue to fight until Rogue returns to her body. Emplate's house is brought to the X-Men's Utopia where, thanks to the X-Club, he becomes trapped. He attempts a final time to kill Bling! but Bling!, together with Rogue, knock him out and send him back to his dimension. In the last panel he is shown to be surrounded by giant beasts in the Glass Moon and his eventual fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #230&lt;/ref&gt;

Emplate as since been revealed to have survived the giant beast and was also able to escape from his dimension, since he as been targeting the Morlocks who live beneath New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men (Vol 4)'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
In order to remain on this physical plane, Emplate must suck on the [[bone marrow]] of other mutants. He does so with the aid of [[vampire|vampiric]] mouths in the palms of his hands. Once he has sampled a mutant's marrow, he can temporarily duplicate their powers. While in this plane of existence, he can remain unsynched with our reality so as to be [[invisibility|invisible]]. He can also see a mutant's &quot;aura&quot; and tell various things about him or her by that. If he is unable to receive enough marrow, he is thrown into a pocket dimension where he is tortured (it is due to this torture that Emplate cannot survive without the use of his respirator). Like true [[vampire]]s, he can somehow turn others into &quot;Emplates&quot; like himself. Another natural power he does have, is his ability to control his own density, from being [[intangibility|intangible]] to [[Vulnerability|invulnerable]].

==Notes==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:emplatesfuture.jpg|thumb|right|Future clan of Emplates attacking [[Xavier's Security Enforcers|XSE]] members]] --&gt;
* In [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s future, a shadowy group called the Emplates preyed on mutants, infecting and assimilating their victims into their ranks. Like Emplate, they also had clawed mouths in their hands.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The Times and Life of Lucas Bishop'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Since Emplate can &quot;infect&quot; others with his vampire-like powers, it makes sense that he would be the [[ancestor|progenitor]] of the group from Bishop's timeline.
* Emplate had a group of lackeys that were not named in the comic book series. For advertising purposes, they were called the [[Hellions (comics)#Emplate's Hellions|Hellions]], but this name was never used by either Emplate or his followers.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The Monets.JPG|thumb|right|The Monets and Emplate, by Moore, Vaughan, Epting and Napolitano]] --&gt;
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Emplate was a member of [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] Elite Mutant Force, alongside his sisters, the Monet Twins who were under Emplate's control. He was killed by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops']] father, [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Age of Apocalypse''&lt;/ref&gt;

He is later restored by Dark Beast and Sugar Man, under the orders of Weapon Omega.&lt;ref&gt;Age of Apocalypse #3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik''' (also known as '''The Phantom of the Opera''', commonly referred to as '''The Phantom''') is the [[title character]] from [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''Le Fantôme de l'Opéra'' (1910), best known to English speakers as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. He is also the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] of many film adaptations of the novel, including the [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|1925 film adaptation]] starring [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]], and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|musical]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Character history==
In the original novel, few details are given regarding Erik's past, although there is no shortage of hints and implications throughout the book. Erik himself laments the fact that his mother was horrified by his appearance (causing him to run away from home at a young age), and that his father, a true master [[masonry|mason]], never even saw him. The text also reveals that &quot;Erik&quot; was not, in fact, his birth name, but one that was given or found &quot;by accident&quot;, as Erik himself says within the work. Leroux sometimes calls him &quot;the man's voice&quot;. Erik refers to himself as &quot;The Opera Ghost&quot;, &quot;The Angel of Music&quot;, and attends a masquerade as the &quot;[[Masque of the Red Death|Red Death]]&quot; (evidently Erik is familiar with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story &quot;[[The Masque of the Red Death]]&quot; (1842). Most of the character's history is revealed by a mysterious figure, known through most of the novel as [[The Persian]] or the Daroga, who had been a local police chief in [[Persia]], following Erik to [[Paris]]; other details are discussed in the novel's epilogue (e.g., his birthplace is given as a small town outside of [[Rouen]], [[France]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Born hideously deformed, he is a &quot;subject of horror&quot; for his family and as a result he runs away as a young boy and falls in with a band of [[Irish Travellers|gypsies]], making his living as an attraction in freak shows, where he is known as ''&quot;le mort vivant&quot;'' (&quot;the living dead&quot;). During his time with the group Erik becomes a great illusionist, magician, and [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]]. His reputation for these skills and his unearthly singing voice spreads quickly, and one day a fur trader mentions him to the [[Shah]] of Persia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Shah orders the Persian to fetch Erik and bring him to the palace. The [[Shah#Shahenshah|Shah-in-Shah]] commissions Erik, who proves himself a gifted [[architecture|architect]], to construct an elaborate palace in [[Mazandaran Province|Mazenderan]]. This is designed with so many trap doors and secret rooms that not even the slightest whisper would be considered private. The design itself carries sound to myriad hidden locations, so that one never knew who might be listening. At some point under the Shah's employment Erik is also a political [[assassination|assassin]], using a unique noose referred to as the [[Punjab Lasso]]. The Persian dwells on the vague horrors that existed at Mazenderan rather than going in depth into the actual circumstances involved.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Shah, pleased with Erik's work and determined that no one else should have such a palace, orders Erik [[blindness|blinded]]. Thinking that Erik could still make another palace even without his eyesight, the Shah orders Erik's execution. It is only by the intervention of the daroga (the Persian) that Erik escapes. Erik then goes to [[Constantinople]] and is employed by its ruler, helping build certain buildings in the Yildiz-Kiosk, among others. However, he has to leave the city for the same reason he left Mazenderan: he knows too much. He also seems to have traveled to Southeast Asia, since he claims to have learned to breathe underwater using a hollow reed from the &quot;Tonkin pirates&quot;. By this time Erik is tired of his nomadic life and wants to &quot;live like everybody else&quot;. For a time he works as a contractor, building &quot;ordinary houses with ordinary bricks&quot;. He eventually bids on a contract to help with the construction of the [[Palais Garnier]], commonly known as the Paris Opéra.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

During the construction, Erik is able to make a sort of playground for himself within the Opera House, creating trapdoors and secret passageways throughout the theatre. He even builds himself a house in the cellars of the Opera where he could live far from man's cruelty. Erik has spent twenty years composing a piece entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''. In one chapter, after he takes Christine to his lair, she asks him to play her a piece from his masterwork. He refuses and says: &quot;I will play you [[Mozart]], if you like, which will only make you weep; but my Don Juan, Christine, burns.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Eventually, after she has wrenched off his mask and seen his deformed face, he begins to play it. Christine says that at first it seems to be &quot;one great awful sob&quot;, but then becomes alert to its nuances and power, as the music is able to convey to her the misery he has endured throughout his life and the hope he finally felt for love.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Upon its completion, Erik originally plans to go to his bed (which is a coffin) and &quot;never wake up&quot;, but by the final chapters of the novel, during which Erik kidnaps Christine right from the stage during a performance, Erik expresses his wish to marry Christine and live a comfortable bourgeois life after his work has been completed. He has stored a massive amount of gunpowder under the Opera, and, should she refuse his offer, plans to detonate it. When she acquiesces to his desires in order to save herself, her lover Raoul (who, aided by the Persian, went looking for Christine and fell into Erik's torture chamber), and the denizens of the Opera, we find out that his part of the bargain was to take the Persian and Raoul above ground.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Erik does so with the Persian, but Raoul was kept &quot;a hostage&quot; and was &quot;locked up comfortably, properly chained&quot; in the dungeon under the opera. When he returns, he finds Christine waiting for him, like &quot;a real living wife&quot; and he swore she tilted her forehead toward him, and he kissed it. Then he says he was so happy that he fell at her feet, crying, and she cries with him, calling him &quot;poor, unhappy Erik&quot; and taking his hand. At this point, he is &quot;just a poor dog ready to die for her&quot; and he returns to her the ring she had lost and said that she was free to go and marry Raoul.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Erik frees Raoul who then leaves with Christine. But before they do, Erik makes Christine promise that when he dies she will come back and bury him. Then she kisses Erik's forehead. Erik dies three weeks later, but not before he goes to visit the Persian and tells him everything, and promises to send him Erik's dearest possessions: the papers that Christine wrote about everything that had happened with her &quot;Angel of Music&quot; and some things that had belonged to her. Christine keeps her promise and returns to the Opera to bury Erik and place the plain gold band he had given her on his finger. Leroux claims that a skeleton bearing such a ring was later unearthed in the Opera cellars.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
&lt;!--
Overall, the original Erik is intense and complex. He is seen vacillating between grandiosity and self-aggrandizing to extreme self-loathing and martyrdom. He has an ungrounded sense of right and wrong. While sometimes he is flippant or joking about murder and torture, he also shows regret for past crimes. A good example of his contradictory morality is his devotion to singing requiem masses... for those who he has killed. While the Persian says that his level of hideousness has made him feel beyond the bounds of normal human morality, Erik also demonstrates great desperation for normalcy and love, explaining that being loved is all he ever needed to be good. He can go from extreme violence to acts of extreme devotion, and is not always able to control himself. He is controlling and possessive of Christine yet acts like her faithful slave, often weeping on his knees before her. While he sometimes plays up his hideous appearance (such as sleeping in a coffin) and often makes wry, self-deprecating jokes about how he looks, he suffers genuinely and tremendously over his appearance and the effect it has on others (such as his mother). The character has a strong sense of humor and often eccentric and mysterious ways of expressing himself. He adheres to proper societal formalities and gentlemanly etiquette, such as in how he dresses, sets up his home and in how he composes his letters to management. There are also signs of him having a Catholic background, namely his preoccupation with requiem masses/the Dies Irae, his desire to be married in front of a priest in the Madeleine church and his gratitude to God at the end for giving him happiness. He is described as having almost superhuman talents, excelling at singing, architecture, composing, music, magic, ventriloquism and invention. Leroux, the author and narrator, describes him as having a huge heart and immense amounts of talent that unfortunately, due to rejection over his appearance, he ended up using for deceit and to prey upon others. Thus the author concludes by pitying and praying over the character in spite of his crimes, questioning why God would make someone that hideous in the first place.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroux|first=Gaston|title=The Phantom of the Opera|publisher=Pierre Lafitte and Cie.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Phantom'' ===
Many different versions of Erik's life are told through other adaptations such as films, television shows, books, and musicals. One such popular literary adaptation is the [[Susan Kay]] novel [[Phantom (Kay novel)|''Phantom'']] (1990), a fictional in-depth story of Erik from the time of his birth to the end of his life at the Paris Opera House.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

For the most part, Kay's novel stays in context with Erik's life history as laid down by Leroux, however Kay (as explained in her Author's Note) changes and shapes the character to match her own vision, influenced by other adaptations besides the original. In addition, the ending/resolution is quite different from Leroux's. The story follows Erik through his entire life, starting with the night of his birth, and is told from different viewpoints throughout the novel (Erik's mother, Erik, Nadir/the Persian, Christine, and Raoul). Kay places the highest priority on portraying romantic aspects of Erik's life. He falls in love twice throughout the novel, but neither of these occasions truly end happily.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== ''Yeston and Kopit'' ===
The theatrical songwriting team of [[Maury Yeston]] and [[Arthur Kopit]] created a musical based on the story which investors backed out of after Webber's version became a huge hit. Erik is portrayed as much kinder and more sympathetic, and also with more of a sense of humor. His mother was a singer in the Opera and, having discovered that she was pregnant with an illegitimate child, swallowed poison. This is the reason for his disfigurement. He was born within the catacombs of the opera house and lived there his entire life. His mother died when he was a young child. His father, Gerard Carriere, was the manager and kept him safe all that time. Over the years, Erik became the creative driving force for the opera company. No artistic decision was made without Carriere seeking his approval.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

It is implied that the main reason for Erik's attraction to Christine is that her astonishing voice and beauty remind him of his mother, the only person who was ever able to look at him with happiness. Yet when he finally brings himself to show Christine his face, she runs away. Christine feels intensely remorseful afterwards and when he is eventually cornered by the police, at the end of the play, she takes off his mask and smiles.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

This storyline was also the basis for the [[The Phantom of the Opera (miniseries)|1990 miniseries]] starring [[Charles Dance]], [[Teri Polo]], and [[Burt Lancaster]] as Carriere.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===''The Canary Trainer''===
In [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s novel ''[[The Canary Trainer]]'', [[Sherlock Holmes]] develops several theories as to the Phantom's identity. His first idea is that he is an employee of the Opera; however, when the Phantom's knowledge of the Opera becomes evident, Holmes then believes that he is [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], having faked his own death. When Garnier's corpse is identified, Holmes then theorizes that the Phantom was Edouard LaFosse, the (fictional) assistant of Garnier who designed much of the Opera's interior and who allegedly died after a building collapse. Holmes theorizes that he did not die, but was merely disfigured and therefore took to hiding in the Opera. However, when Holmes finally confronts the Phantom, he claims that he cannot speak without his mask, as his mother forced him to wear it whenever he wished to speak as a child, and he is not Edouard LaFosse. Holmes therefore admits that he is not sure how true any of the theories or claims of the Phantom's identity are. The Phantom never provides a given name in the novel; he only tells Christine that his name is &quot;Nobody&quot; (a reference to the name [[Odysseus]] gave [[Polyphemus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]]'').{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Regardless of his identity, the Phantom in ''The Canary Trainer'' is much more unhinged and bloodthirsty than in the original novel or play. For example, when killing Madame Giry's replacement with the chandelier, he kills &quot;almost thirty men and women in the twinkling of an eye&quot;, just to ensure that he kills his main target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Nicholas|title=The Canary Trainer: From the Memoirs of John H. Watson as edited by Nicholas Meyer|date=1995|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-393-31241-0|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqBjvfe7wA4C&amp;|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Angel of the Opera''===
In Sam Siciliano's novel ''The Angel of the Opera'', Sherlock Holmes is brought in to solve the case of the Opera Ghost, and both Erik's and Holmes's stories unfold through the eyes of Holmes's assistant, Henri Vernier. Siciliano places Holmes and Vernier at several of the crucial scenes in Erik and Christine's relationship, and draws parallels between Erik and Holmes. Holmes sympathizes with Erik so much that after Christine leaves him, Holmes brings him back to England. One of the first people that Erik meets on his arrival is a blind girl with a fondness for music.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Erik's deformity==
In the original novel, Erik is described as corpse-like and is referred to as having a &quot;death's-head&quot; (human skull) throughout the story. He has no nose; eyes that are sunken so deep that all is seen are two skull-like eye sockets except when his golden eyes glow in the dark; skin that is yellow and tightly stretched across his bones; and only a few wisps of ink-black hair behind his ears and on his forehead. (His mouth is never described in as much detail, but is referred to as a 'lipless' 'dead mouth' by Christine, and Erik acknowledges that his mouth is abnormal when lifting up his mask to display ventriloquism.) He is described as extremely thin, so much so that he resembles a skeleton. Christine graphically describes his cold, bony hands, which also smell of death. Erik woefully describes himself to Christine as a corpse who is &quot;built up with death from head to foot.&quot; According to the Persian, Erik was born with this deformity, and was exhibited as 'le mort vivant' in freak shows earlier in his life. Erik sometimes plays up his macabre appearance, such as sleeping in a coffin and dressing up as the Red Death for the masked ball.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s characterization of Erik in the silent film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) remains closest to the book in content, in that Erik's face resembles a skull with an elongated nose slit and protruding, crooked teeth. In this version, Erik is said to have been deformed from birth. Chaney was a master make-up artist and was considered avant garde for creating and applying Erik's facial makeup design himself. It is said he kept it secret until the first day of filming. The result was allegedly so frightening to the women of the time that theaters showing the movie were cautioned to keep smelling salts on hand.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Several movies based on the novel vary the deformities (or in the case of [[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|Dario Argento's 1998 film]], the lack thereof). In [[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Universal's 1943 adaptation]], a poor musician tries to publish his music, and then wrongly accuses the publisher Maurice Pleyel of trying to plagiarize his work. He then strangles the publisher and tries to retrieve his music, only to be disfigured when the publisher's assistant throws [[etching]] [[acid]] in his face. In the musical horror film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974), Winslow (the Phantom character) gets his head caught in a record-press, while Robert Englund's horror-version has him selling his soul to [[Satan]] and having his face mutilated as a result. This version also has a gruesome variation on the mask, in which Erik is sewing flesh to his face.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical adaptation]], only half of Erik's face is deformed (thus the famous half-mask often associated with Erik's appearance.) His show was originally planned to have a full mask and full facial disfigurement, but when the director, [[Hal Prince]], realized that it would make expression onstage very difficult, they halved the mask. The logo featuring a full mask was publicized before the change. The deformity in the musical includes a gash on the right side of his partially balding head with exposed skull tissue, an elongated right nostril, a missing right eyebrow, swollen lips, different colored eyes, and a wrinkled, warped right cheek. It is covered by a white half mask and wig. It originally took roughly four hours per performance to put the prosthetics on in the original London productions. On Broadway, it was cut to roughly three, and over the years has been reduced to 45 minutes. More than one Phantom has described make-up disasters onstage. [[Michael Crawford]] recounts a story where he pulled away from the kiss at the end only to see that &quot;[his] lower lip was now hanging off [[Sarah Brightman|Sarah [Brightman]'s]] face!&quot;. To cover the flub, he pulled her back for another kiss and &quot;took back the lips&quot; and kept that side of his head turned away from the audience.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the [[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|2004 film adaptation]] of the musical, Erik's makeup was made to look much less gruesome than previous adaptations of the story. Instead of a skull-like face, his disfigurement resembles that of a mildly malformed face, which he covers with the mask. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Butler was more &quot;conventionally handsome&quot; than his predecessors &quot;in a GQ kind of way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/andrew-lloyd-webbers-phantom-of-the-opera-2004 | title=Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera | publisher=Roger Ebert | date=December 21, 2004 | accessdate=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storyline==

===Arrival of Dr. Evans===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}} 
Renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Greg Evans (Tilford) arrives in fictional [[Llanview]] in June 2009 at the request of [[Clint Buchanan]] ([[Jerry verDorn]]) for a paid [[consultant (medicine)|consult]] on performing [[spinal surgery]] on his nephew [[Matthew Buchanan|Matthew]] ([[Eddie Alderson]]). Months earlier, Greg's younger sister [[Destiny Evans|Destiny]] (Shenell Edmonds) asked for a favor to help Matthew, and when Greg arrives, Destiny comes to realize Greg returned home from his successful career abroad because of Clint's check and not Destiny's letters.

Matthew's parents [[Bo Buchanan|Bo]] ([[Robert S. Woods]] and [[Nora Hanen|Nora Buchanan]] refuse to allow the surgery on [[minor (law)|minor]] Matthew, and Greg proceeds to leave town before being guilted to stay by his brother [[Shaun Evans (One Life to Live)|Shaun]] ([[Sean Ringgold]]) and Shaun's girlfriend and Matthew's sister [[Rachel Gannon]] ([[Daphnee Duplaix]]). Matthew successfully sues his parents for the right to authorize surgery, and Greg tell Matthew that he would testify on his behalf, angering Matthew's Rachel.

Greg and Rachel kiss after Greg testifies in court for Matthew, and Rachel decides to break up with Shaun. Before Rachel tells Shaun, he is shot in the head on bodyguard duty for the [[Cramer family]]. Greg performs successful [[trauma surgery]] on Shaun, who goes into a brief coma. After tests, Greg determines he left a bullet fragment lodged in his brain. Devastated, Greg vows to never perform surgery again and recommends Matthew to a [[Seattle]]-based surgeon. Matthew soon agrees when Greg agrees to supervise the procedure.

Greg prepares to leave for Seattle to observe the surgery with Rachel in tow, angering his mother [[Phylicia Evans|Phylicia]] who was aware of Greg's affair with his brother's girlfriend. After Mrs. Evans confronts Rachel, she goes on a date with Shaun where she reveals herself not to be in love with him. Shaun senses the bond between Rachel and Greg and asks if they are romantically involved, a question Rachel dodges. Later, Rachel tells Greg she did not want to pursue a relationship with Greg for fear of hurting Shaun. Shaun sees them kiss and lashes out at them, warning Rachel that Greg would eventually bore of her and move on to the next woman. After much begging from Destiny, Shaun asks Greg as a brother to perform help in Matthew's surgery, and he obliges.

Rachel moves into an apartment with her [[social worker]] colleague [[Schuyler Joplin]] ([[Scott Clifton]]), a move with leaves Greg jealous. When a bottle of [[Oxytocin]] goes lost at Llanview Hospital, Greg tells Rachel, who insists on Schuyler's innocence. Greg and Rachel soon break it off after Rachel relentlessly defends Schuyler, and she leaves Llanview for [[Chicago]].

===Téa and Charlene===
[[Téa Delgado]] ([[Florencia Lozano]]) soon finds herself in Greg's care after fainting in court, and Greg diagnoses her with a [[brain tumor]]. Greg and Téa proceed for months with [[chemotherapy]] but to no avail. As Téa's mental condition apparently deteriorates, Greg suggests Téa die in privacy at a hospice in [[St. Kitts]]. It soon becomes clear Téa was not suffering a brain tumor but that Greg drugged her after being ordered in a [[blackmail]] by [[Elijah Clarke (One Life to Live)|Elijah &quot;Eli&quot; Clarke]] ([[Matt Walton]]) to do so and kill her.

[[Victor Lord, Jr.|Todd]] ([[Trevor St. John]]) and Téa's daughter [[Danielle Manning]], arrive to see their dying loved one only for Greg to tell them she'd already died. Feeling guilty, Greg reveals he moved Téa to a clinic in Cherryvale, [[Pennsylvania]] to hide her from Eli. After Téa awakes from an [[induced coma]], Greg lies and tells Téa she had been miraculously cured. Greg soon returns to St. Kitts greeted by Eli, who he finds him unconscious with a pool of blood beneath his head.

Attempting to perform surgery on Eli, who wakes up and refuses treatment. Greg then proceeded to inject an Eli with a lethal dose of [[morphine]], however Greg mistakenly receives the dose instead and is rushed back to Llanview in a coma. Eli became aware that Greg had survived and attempted to kill him by drugging him but is stopped by Dr. [[Vivian Wright (One Life to Live)|Vivian Wright]] (Kearran Giovanni). Wanting to come clean, Greg reveals to his parents his desire to truth to reveal Destiny's paternity to she and Shaun.

As they all stood together, Greg's parents Phylicia and [[Richard Evans (One Life to Live)|Richard Evans]] ([[Frankie Faison]]) revealed her to be Greg's daughter. They soon divulge [[backstory]] that after Greg began [[medical school]], he had gotten a girl named Charlene pregnant, but he did not want the child, so Phylicia and Richard agreed to raise Destiny as their own child. At the time of conception, Charlene was Shaun's girlfriend and it is uncovered Greg killed Charlene after a confrontation, disposing of the body.

Greg soon reveals this truth to an upset Destiny. With help from Nora, Greg receives a sentence of six years in Statesville Prison for Charlene's murder, apologizing to Destiny as he is led to lockup November 29, 2010.

'''Lee Everett''' is the main character of first season of ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' video game. Lee is the [[player character]] in the first season of the game, appearing in five episodes. Tasked with protecting a girl named [[Clementine (The Walking Dead)|Clementine]] in the midst of a [[zombie apocalypse]], Lee allies with several other characters and groups. When creating Lee, the developers attempted to achieve realism, with a strong emphasis on him being a parental figure to Clementine. He is voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]], an American voice actor. He received positive reception for his role in the game, specifically the voice work and the writing. Fennoy was nominated for Best Performance by a Human Male at the [[VGX (award show)|Spike VGA]].

== Appearances ==

=== ''The Walking Dead'' Season  One ===
Prior to the events of the game, Lee was a professor of history at the [[University of Georgia]], but one day came home to find his wife sleeping with another man, a state senator, after constant fighting with his wife for travelling often for her job. In a fit of rage, Lee killed him; he was subsequently tried and sentenced to prison for murder, long since coming to regret his actions. His crime also distanced him from his parents and brother.

The onset of the zombie apocalypse occurs as Lee is being taken to prison; when the car transporting him crashes into a Walker he manages to escape, but he quickly realizes the dire situation as he soon finds himself hunted across the countryside by several Walkers. He takes shelter in a nearby suburban home, where he finds young Clementine who has been hiding from the zombies as her parents had left for Savannah some time before the apocalypse. Recognizing that Clementine would remain in danger, he offers to take and protect her, hoping that they will be able to find her parents. He eventually goes with her to the [[Hershel Greene]] farm and meets a fisherman named Kenny and his wife, Katjaa, and son, Duck. After an accident with Walkers claims the life of Hershel's son, Shawn, the five are thrown out and eventually meet with other survivors, and form a small group, though Lee remains subdued about his history. After discovering the fate of his own family in Macon, Lee takes on more of a role of a father-figure to Clementine.

After having holed up in a motel for three months with dwindling supplies, the group meet the St. John family who invite them to dinner at their family dairy. The group agrees to send out a delegation to the St. Johns' farmstead to see if they are trustworthy, however Lee discovers the meat the St. Johns is serving for dinner is human, and the family are cannibals. The electric fence protecting the dairy malfunctions and the place is overrun. Soon after, the group is forced to flee and eventually start heading to Savannah via a train. En route, Lee starts to help Clementine learn survival skills such as how to use a gun and why she needs to keep her hair short. As they near the city, Clementine's walkie-talkie goes off, revealing a man that knows of Lee's actions to this point and promises Clementine that she will be safe once he deals with Lee.

In Savannah, the survivors look for a boat and supplies to flee the mainland. They encounter another group of survivors led by Vernon, a doctor. With Vernon's help, they are able to prepare the boat for their journey; before Vernon leaves them, he warns Lee that he does not think he is a fit person to be Clementine's guardian, and offers to take the child, but this doesn't take place. The next morning, Lee wakes to find Clementine gone, and while searching nearby, he was taken by surprise by a walker and Lee eventually discovers that he was bitten. With what little time he has, Lee and the other survivors agree to look for Clementine, at first believing her to have been taken by Vernon. Instead, the man on the walkie-talkie reveals he has taken Clementine, and tells her she will be safe at the hotel that her parents would have been at. After briefly passing out in the now-abandoned safehouse of Vernon's group, Lee is given the option of amputating his bitten arm. Either way, Lee and the group are able to escape from the hospital where they make their way back to the house, but find that the boat has been stolen by Vernon's group. Shortly after the house is overrun with walkers but the group escape into the attic, where they eventually find a way out. Many casualties arise while making their way to the hotel, Lee is separated from the others and promises to meet them later on with Clementine.  Barely hanging onto consciousness, Lee makes it to the hotel, and finds the man; the man explains that Lee's group had previously taken provisions from his family's car, and ultimately leading to the death of his wife and children, and goes to question Lee's other decisions and, regardless of whether or not Lee had helped in taking the provisions from the car, ultimately berates him and plans to punish him and look after Clementine as his own. When the man is shown as insane, talking to his wife's severed head in a bag, Lee gets Clementine's help to subdue the man and either kills him by choking him to death, or being shot in the head by Clementine after Lee is almost killed. They make it out of the hotel where they see Clementine's parents as reanimated before Lee passes out.

When Lee wakes, he is out of strength and barely able to keep conscious, but finds Clementine has dragged him to safety. With his time short, Lee helps Clementine secure keys and a gun to escape to the rooftops, and instructs her to find Omid and Christa. The player can choose to have Lee instruct Clementine to either shoot him or do nothing and leave him be to become a walker due to the fact that the noise might attract walkers, where Clementine will choose an action based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;faces of death 5&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantbomb.com/news/faces-of-death-part-5-no-time-left/4512/ | title = Faces of Death, Part 5: No Time Left | first = Patrick | last = Klepek | date = 2013-01-09 | accessdate = 2013-01-09 | publisher = [[Giant Bomb]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Walking Dead'' Season Two===
Lee appears briefly in a flashback that Clementine has after falling unconscious from being shot during the events of the final episode. The flashback occurs during the time the group has fled the motel after Lilly killed Carley/Doug, and Clementine recalls the advice that Lee gave her about learning to survive and cope in this new reality, considerations that she has to keep in mind once she regains consciousness.

==Concept and creation==
Lee appeared in the 2012 episodic video game ''[[The Walking Dead (2012 video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' as the protagonist and playable character. He is voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]], and was written by multiple people, including [[Gary Whitta]] in the fourth episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview1&quot;/&gt; Fennoy received an audition in an email, and after completing it, he received a call confirming that he got the role. The audition asked for actors to portray him in a &quot;very real&quot; fashion, which is a part of Lee's design that attracted Fennoy. He called Lee &quot;complicated&quot;, due to his criminal history, his concern for keeping [[Clementine (The Walking Dead)|Clementine]] safe, and the fact that he associates with people that he may not have had it not been for the zombie outbreak. He added that him having a child of his own helped him relate to Lee and Clementine's relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INTERVIEW – In Conversation With Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett, The Walking Dead: The Game) |url=http://alternativemagazineonline.co.uk/2012/05/14/interview-in-conversation-with-dave-fennoy-lee-everett-the-walking-dead-the-game/ |publisher=Alternative Magazine Online |last=Mulrooney |first=Marty |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitta described their relationship as &quot;emotionally authentic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview1&quot;/&gt; Dan Connors, CEO of [[Telltale Games]], compared Lee to [[Rick Grimes]], the protagonist of ''The Walking Dead'' [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|comics]] and [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|TV series]]. He called him both tough and smart, while also caring. He also called him a &quot;reflection of the player's choices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Walking Dead Interview On Zombie Fights, Player Choices, And Retail Plans |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/03/21/the-walking-dead-interview-on-zombie-fights-player-choices-and-retail-plans/ |publisher=Siliconera |first=Spencer |last=Yip |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telltale designer and writer Harrison G. Pink commented that it was important to make everything Lee would say believable, and that Lee is a &quot;human being&quot; with &quot;real needs and real fears and real desires&quot;. While they wanted to allow players to choose what Lee says, all options are things that Lee would realistically say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: The Walking Dead writer on making a game with 'no good decisions' |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/75594/the-walking-dead-is-about-impossible-choices-writer-says |publisher=[[Shack News]] |last=Watts |first=Steve |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Lee was acclaimed by critics and fans. [[IGN]]'s Colin Campbell wrote an article detailing why Lee &quot;really matters&quot;. He explains that the reason why the game is so good is because Lee has a lot of great qualities, such as being nice and modest about his abilities. He goes on to describe him as an &quot;everyman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Walking Dead: Why Lee Everett Really Matters |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/09/the-walking-dead-why-lee-everett-really-matters |publisher=[[IGN]] |last=Campbell |first=Colin |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow IGN writer Greg Miller also cited Lee for why he enjoys the game; he wrote that he felt he was actually involved in Lee's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E3 2012: Walking Dead Episode 2 Is Way More Brutal |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/06/e3-2012-walking-dead-episode-2-is-way-more-brutal |publisher=[[IGN]] |last=Miller |first=Greg |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kotaku]]'s Kirk Hamilton writes that he is more interested in seeing Lee grow than [[Rick Grimes]], the protagonist of ''The Walking Dead'' [[The Walking Dead (comic book)|comics]] and [[The Walking Dead (TV series)|TV series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=5 Reasons The Walking Dead Game Is Better Than The TV Show |url=http://kotaku.com/5905847/5-reasons-the-walking-dead-game-is-better-than-the-tv-show |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |last=Hamilton |first=Kirk |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rock Paper Shotgun]]'s John Walker wrote that Lee was an everyman character in zombie fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wot I Think: The Walking Dead Episode One |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/04/25/wot-i-think-the-walking-dead-episode-one/ |publisher=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |last=Walker |first=John |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Emily Richardson felt that the characters drove the story, and cited Lee and his &quot;mysterious and complex&quot; character design as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Walking Dead Episode One review |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/video-game-reviews/9274108/The-Walking-Dead-Episode-One-review.html |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |last=Richardson |first=Emily |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar staff named Lee the 84th-best video game hero.

The '''Evil Queen''', also known as the '''Wicked Queen''' or just the '''Queen''', and sometimes instead identified by her given name as '''Queen Grimhilde''', is the primary [[antagonist]] in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s 1937 animated film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and a villain character in the extended [[Snow White (Disney franchise)|Disney's ''Snow'' White franchise]]. She is based on [[Queen (Snow White)|the Evil Queen]] character from the European [[fairy tale]] &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot;.

In the film, similar to the [[Brothers Grimm]] story, the Evil Queen is cold, cruel, and extremely vain, and obsessively desires to remain the &quot;fairest in the land&quot;. She becomes madly envious over the beauty of her stepdaughter, Princess [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]], as well as the attentions of the Prince from another land; such [[love triangle]] element is one of Disney's changes to the story. This leads her to plot the death of Snow White and ultimately on the path to her own demise, which in the film is indirectly caused by the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. The film's version of the Queen character uses her dark magic powers to actually transform herself into an old woman instead of just taking a disguise like in the Grimms' story; this appearance of hers is commonly referred to as the '''Wicked Witch''' or alternatively as the '''Old Hag''' or just the ''' Witch'''. The Queen dies in the film, but lives on in a variety of noncanonical Disney works.

The film's version of the Queen was created by [[Walt Disney]] and [[Joe Grant]], and originally animated by [[Art Babbit]] and voiced by [[Lucille La Verne]]. Inspiration for her design came from several sources, including the characters of Queen Hash-a-Motep from ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' and Princess [[Kriemhild]] from ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'', as well as actors such as [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gale Sondergaard]]. The Queen has since been voiced by [[Eleanor Audley]], [[June Foray]], [[Janet Waldo]], Eda Reiss Merin,  [[Louise Chamis]] and [[Susanne Blakeslee]], and was portrayed live by [[Anne Francine]] (musical), [[Jane Curtin]] (50th anniversary TV special), and [[Olivia Wilde]] (''Disney Dream Portraits''), [[Kathy Najimy]] (''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]''), and in an alternative version, by [[Lana Parrilla]] (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'').

This interpretation of the classic fairy tale character has been very well received by film critics and general public, often being considered one of Disney's most iconic and menacing villains. Besides in the film, the Evil Queen has made numerous appearances in Disney attractions and productions, including not only these directly related to the tale of Snow White, such as ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', sometimes appearing in them alongside [[Maleficent]] from ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. The film's version of the Queen has also become a popular [[archetype]] that influenced a number of artists and non-Disney works.

She regularly asks the mirror who is the fairest in the realm (&quot;Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?&quot; which is often misquoted as &quot;Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2007/10/18/top-15-film-misquotes/|title=Top 15 Film Misquotes|work=Listverse|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2403742/Do-feel-lucky-punk--Famous-movie-quotes-wrong-revealed.html |title='Do you feel lucky, punk?': Famous movie quotes you always get wrong revealed &amp;#124; Daily Mail Online |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the mirror would always reply that she is.          

One day, however, the mirror tells her that there is a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old&lt;ref name=wdm/&gt; stepdaughter, Princess [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]]. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' emerging beauty, therefore turning her into a [[scullery maid]] in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]], Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the [[Seven Dwarfs]], revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's [[black magic]] but decide to take in Snow White anyway.

Furious that Humbert tricked her, the Queen decides that first Snow White shall die by her own hand and at any cost. She goes down the dungeon to her secret room where she practices her dark magic, complete with a pet raven that &quot;knows all her secrets,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Dakin, ''Disney Villains: The Essential Guide'', page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and in desperation uses her spellbook and cauldron to mix a potion that transforms her into a [[hag]]. Her beauty is shrouded in ugliness and age, though presumably reversible.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Breuer, ''Crafting the Witch: Gendering Magic in Medieval and Early Modern England'', page 134.&lt;/ref&gt; She then conjures a poison apple, which will cause &quot;the Sleeping Death&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19930729&amp;id=xxpgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yW0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1318,8314279 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs], ''Observer-Reporter'', July 29, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeds to leave the castle via a moat boat. She is sure that no one would know or perform the counter-curse to her spell, and believes the Dwarfs would bury her rival alive, thinking her dead. The Queen comes to the cottage, followed by two vicious vultures, and finds Snow White baking a pie for Grumpy the dwarf. Somehow Snow White's animal friends realize that the old hag is the Queen. After an unsuccessful attempt to warn Snow White by attacking the Queen, they go to warn the Dwarfs of the Queen's arrival. The Queen tricks the princess into letting her inside the cottage and eating the bewitched apple, telling her that it is a magic wishing apple. Snow White takes a bite and falls to the floor, apparently dead.

The Queen rejoices in her victory, but is soon discovered by the angry Seven Dwarfs, who grab pickaxes and chase her deep into the forest as a great storm begins. She climbs up into the mountains, where she gets trapped upon a precipice that overlooks a seemingly bottomless canyon. She tries to push down a large boulder to crush the approaching Dwarfs. Just then a lightning bolt strikes between her and the boulder, destroying the precipice and sending the Queen (along with the boulder) down the cliff to her doom, screaming while she falls to the jagged rocks below (this scream was reused in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' when [[Maleficent]] is pierced by the Sword of Truth). As the Dwarfs look wide-eyed over the cliff's edge, they cannot see her, but the vultures descend into the chasm. The Queen's dark reign is over, and her castle is then taken over and the revived Snow White and the Prince who broke the spell. (A 1936 pre-release ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' novelization by Dorothy Ann Blank, a member of the film's story team, affirms that the Queen in fact dies: &quot;Far below, in a chasm as dark as her own wicked soul, lay the body of the hateful Queen. No magic would ever bring her to life again.&quot;&lt;ref name=tgh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-good-housekeeping-serial.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: The Good Housekeeping Serial |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Conception, design and portrayal===
Early concepts for the film called for a &quot;fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied&quot; Queen. However, [[Walt Disney]] became concerned that such an approach would make the character seem less plausible. Sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, he advised that attention be paid exclusively to &quot;scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear.&quot;&lt;ref name=pj&gt;Paul Muljadi, ''Disney Theatrical Animated Features'', page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Disney further developed the main plot himself ([[Ollie Johnston]] said the film's story was based on the idea that the Queen's character was going to murder &quot;another drawing&quot; and Disney decided to make it appear believable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2011/11/disney-news-magazine-50th-anniversary.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: Disney News Magazine (50th Anniversary - 1987) |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, whom he envisioned as a mixture of [[Lady Macbeth]] and the [[Big Bad Wolf]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated117&quot;&gt;John Hanson Saunders, ''The Evolution of Snow White: A Close Textual Analysis of Three Versions of the Snow White Fairy Tale'', page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2014/03/18/villain-stories/ |title=Villain Stories &amp;#124; Disney Insider |publisher=Blogs.disney.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to set on &quot;a high collar stately beautiful type&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barrier, ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age'', page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; whose &quot;beauty is sinister, mature, plenty of curves – she becomes ugly and menacing when scheming.&quot;&lt;ref name=wdm/&gt; According to the 1993 Disney Classics series of trading cards, &quot;she is really two characters, the beautiful evil Queen and the grotesquely evil witch.&quot;

The original outline of the story featured the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' version of the tale (the Dwarfs would arrive in time to remove it). The envious Queen would also decide to take possession of Snow White's attractive young suitor, the 18-year-old&lt;ref name=wdm/&gt; Prince (described in a press kit as &quot;every woman's dream man&quot;&lt;ref name=bv58/&gt;) for herself, offering him an opportunity to share the throne with her through a marriage.&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennetti.fi/sw_scariest2.html |title=The Fairest ...And The Scariest Of Them All: A Doomed Love Triangle |publisher=Kennetti.fi |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ug/&gt; With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen would have him captured by her guards and taken to her dungeon to be suspended in chains in a [[torture chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animatormag.com/archive/issue-20/issue-20-page-24/ |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs – Disney‘s fabulous folly – Page 5 &amp;#124; Animator Mag – Library |publisher=Animatormag.com |date=August 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later visit him there and used her sorcery to taunt him by bringing the dungeon's skeletons (also chained to the walls) to life and making them dance, identifying one skeleton as &quot;Prince Oswald&quot;,&lt;ref name=wdm&gt;Richard Holliss, Brian Sibley, ''Walt Disney's Masterpiece Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', pages 14, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; only for the Prince to defy her again.

According to production story-meeting notes from October 1934, &quot;Queen wants to marry Prince, but he refuses to acknowledge 'that she is the fairest in the land,' since he has seen Snow White.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas, ''The Disney Villain'', age 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in story notes that the Queen has magical power only over her own domain, which is the castle.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennetti.fi/sw_scariest3.html |title=THE FAIREST ...AND THE SCARIEST OF THEM ALL: Dark Secrets of the Dungeon |publisher=Kennetti.fi |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another note states about their meeting in the dungeon: &quot;This is a sequence of gruesome comedy ― of dancing skeletons ― fantastic shadows ― witchcraft and deviltry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rudy Behlmer, ''America's Favorite Movies: Behind the Scenes'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Prince Oswald was an inside joke reference to [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=ug/&gt; The Queen was originally intended to have seven [[black panther]]s guarding the entrance to her secret room with the Mirror;&lt;ref name=tgh/&gt; a concept art of the Queen walking a pet panther can be seen in [[The Walt Disney Family Museum]] and at [[Disney California Adventure]].

The books ''Snow White: Magic Mirror Book'' and ''The Complete Story of Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' reveal that the Huntsman was afraid to disobey a command to kill Snow White because the Queen's might feed him to her panthers or shrink him magically &quot;to the size of a walnut&quot;.&lt;ref name=triangle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1937fan.blogspot.com/2011/01/snow-white-magic-mirror-book.html|title=Whistle While We Blog|author=1937 Fan|publisher=1937fan.blogspot.com|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1937 novelization, the Queen vows the Huntsman would pay dearly for allowing her stepdaughter to escape, but first she would deal with Snow White herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TVFZa-niGWI/VgdQ4wgw01I/AAAAAAABGw4/67kUabyx_zU/s1600/1937DavidMcKayA6.jpg |format=JPG |title=Snow White book page |website=4.bp.blogspot.com |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, the Huntsman would too be dragged to the dungeon when the Queen finds out that he has betrayed her,&lt;ref name=triangle/&gt; and the Queen might smash her own Mirror in anger.&lt;ref name=ug&gt;David Koenig, ''Mouse Under Glass: Secrets of Disney Animation &amp; Theme Parks'', page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennetti.fi/sw_scariest4.html |title=THE FAIREST ...AND THE SCARIEST OF THEM ALL: The Rescue of the Prince |publisher=Kennetti.fi |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after transforming herself, she decides to punish the Prince for having scorned her.

The Queen is a primary character in the [[Disneyland]] rides [[Snow White's Scary Adventures]] (first opened in 1955), where she is seen more than any other character in all four versions of the ride, recreating a number of scenes from the film, sometimes including the torture chamber from an abandoned concept, with &quot;a few skeletons of her past victims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Eurodisney Pocket Guide'', page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In one new scene, she turns into a hag while standing in front of the mirror (back to the visitors) and intoning: &quot;Magic Mirror on the wall, with this disguise I'll fool them all!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tison Pugh, ''The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past'', page 64.&lt;/ref&gt; She also appears in her hag form at the roller coaster [[Seven Dwarfs Mine Train]], first opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/destinations/2014/05/01/disney-world-seven-dwarfs-mine-train-roller-coaster/8552627/ |title=Sneak peek: Disney's new Seven Dwarfs Mine Train |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''The Disney Villains Mix and Mingle'' and ''Mickey's Boo-to-You Halloween Parade'' shows during [[Magic Kingdom]]'s [[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]], the Queen is one of the villains led by Maleficent that appear during the [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] Castle Forecourt Stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-halloween-party-changes-villains-show-20141010-post.html |title=Disney World Halloween Party changes |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/27/big-thrills-little-chills-at-disney-halloween-bash |title=Big thrills, little chills at Disney Halloween bash &amp;#124; USA &amp;#124; Travel |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2015-10-27 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susanne Blakeslee]] voiced the Queen at 2001's [[Share A Dream Come True Parade]], where she could be seen transform herself into a hag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/871272/Disney-celebrates-100-years-of-magic.html?pg=all |title=Disney celebrates 100 years of magic |publisher=Deseret News |date=October 28, 2001 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wicked Queen is one of the &quot;favourite&quot; villains included in Magic Kingdom Park's special pre-parade procession &quot;It's Good to be Bad&quot; a night before the annual [[Main Street Electrical Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/tag/disney-side/page/3/ |title=Disney Side « Disney Parks Blog |publisher=Disneyparks.disney.go.com |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One event featured a giant interactive mirror and included the Queen and two other &quot;Divas of Evil&quot;, Maleficent and [[Cruella de Vil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2010/10/creating-your-dream-with-disney-event-group/ |title=Creating Your Dream with Disney Event Group « Disney Parks Blog |publisher=Disneyparks.disney.go.com |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also prominently appears at Villains Unleashed party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mauney |first=Matt |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-villains-unleashed-hollywood-studios,0,5549477.story |title=Villain-themed event coming to Disney's Hollywood Studios |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=June 6, 2014 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshplaza.com/article/129618/Disney-guests-enjoy-Chiquita-Apple-Bites|title=Disney guests enjoy Chiquita Apple Bites|publisher=Freshplaza.com|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a separately ticketed event at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] that was introduced in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/06/take-a-sneak-peek-at-the-villains-unleashed-guest-list-at-disneys-hollywood-studios/ |title=Take a Sneak Peek at the ‘Villains Unleashed’ Guest List at Disney’s Hollywood Studios « Disney Parks Blog |publisher=Disneyparks.disney.go.com |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interactive gallery [[Walt Disney: One Man's Dream]], the Queen appears alongside Maleficent and [[Judge Frollo]] in the villains' act of the show, where she seems to be the leader of the trio. On the cruise ship ''[[Disney Fantasy]]'', the Queen, appearing with her raven, is one of the seven suspects (and sometimes the culprit)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sachs |first=Andrea |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/lifestyle/travel/i-dream-of-disney-/2011/02/18/ABZAQSQ_story.html |title=I Dream of Disney |publisher=The Washington Post |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the interactive gallery Midship Detective Agency's story &quot;The Case of The Plundered Paintings&quot;.

===Film and television===
The Queen is featured in some Disney television specials like ''[[Our Unsung Villains]]'' (1956) and ''[[Disney's Greatest Villains]]'' (1977). Segments of the Queen's appearance are also shown in ''[[Disney's Halloween Treat]]'' (1982) and in ''[[A Disney Halloween]]'' (1983). She makes small cameo appearances in the animated series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee]] (where she is seen sitting with [[Lady Tremaine]] in her queen form, and with [[Madam Mim]] and [[Witch Hazel (Disney)|Witch Hazel]] in her witch form) and in the films ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) and ''[[Runaway Brain]]'' (1995), shown there in her witch form.

In the live-action television special ''Disney's Golden Anniversary of Snow White'' (1987), the Queen is played by [[Jane Curtin]] in a parodic scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Terrace, ''Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936–2012, 2d ed.'', page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; She casts a spell on Grumpy in an attempt to get him to persuade the other Dwarfs to retire and destroy the original film after the 50 years. After the failure of this, her Mirror convinces her to finally quit &quot;this whole curse business&quot; and focus on her current career as a television [[horror host]].

The Queen (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee) is the main villain in the 2005 direct-to-video animated film ''[[Once Upon a Halloween]]'', but appears only in the Witch version despite misleading cover art (furthermore, only her shadow is shown). In it, the Queen plots to conquer Halloween and asks her cauldron to show several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan. The cauldron also explains its origins as it is one of the cauldrons formerly owned by the three witches from ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]''. Eventually, the cauldron turns against the Wicked Queen and makes her vanish into nothingness.

In [[Mike Disa]]'s and [[Evan Spiliotopoulos]]' abandoned pitch for the [[DisneyToons]]' ''Snow White'' prequel film ''The Seven Dwarfs'', a beautiful girl named '''Narcissa''' appears to aid the dwarfs against an evil wizard, who would be eventually revealed as her father whom she would betray and trap him inside a mirror. Narcissa steals the ancient magic secrets of the Olden Dwarfs, marries and then murders Snow White's father, and &quot;begins her reign as the Evil Queen, with the damned soul of her own father forever encased in the Magic Mirror as her slave. Thus, the dwarfs must live in hiding to protect their families from the Queen's vengeance.&quot; Three computer-animated sequels to ''The Seven Dwarfs'' &quot;were to follow the title characters return home to families and friends after the Evil Queen's death in ''Snow White''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/mike-disa-and-the-seven-dwarfs-how-the-snow-white-prequel-became-a-dopey-movie/|title=Mike Disa and The Seven Dwarfs: How the Snow White prequel became a Dopey movie • Animated Views|publisher=|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/04/03/did-you-know-disney-once-planned-a-prequel-to-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-5793091/ |title=Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs prequel once planned by Disney &amp;#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2016-04-03 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 [[Disney Channel Original Movies|Disney Channel Original Movie]] titled ''[[Descendants (2015 film)|Descendants]]'', the aged Evil Queen (played by [[Kathy Najimy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/kathy-najimy-cast/ |title=Kathy Najimy to Play Evil Queen in Disney Channel's 'Descendants' |publisher=TheWrap |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is among a host of other villains who have been imprisoned on a forbidden Isle of the Lost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |url=http://www.hitfix.com/comedy/disneys-lost-the-plot-with-descendants-angsty-teen-children-of-classic-villains |title=Disneys Lost The Plot With Descendants Angsty Teen Children Of Classic Villains |publisher=Hitfix.com |date=June 16, 2014 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her daughter Evie (played by Sofia Carson)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/disney-channel-descendants-sophia-carson-evil-queen-daughter-evvie |title=Disney's 'Descendants' Casts Newcomer Sofia Carson as Evil Queen's Daughter (Exclusive) |publisher=TheWrap |date=April 16, 2014 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is among their offspring who are allowed to return into the kingdom to attend school alongside the offspring of iconic Disney heroes (Evie's father is unidentified.). The Evil Queen is portrayed as Maleficent's closest confident and best friend. Its title image features the iconic red apple of the Evil Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geeknation.com/disney-channel-creating-original-live-action-movie-about-offspring-of-disneys-villains/ |title=Disney Channel Creating Original Live-Action Movie About Offspring of Disneys Villains |publisher=GeekNation |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/assets/pr/html/pr63022.html |title=E  Releases |publisher=Disneychannelmedianet.com |date= |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also prominently featured in a teaser trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disney.com.au/disney-channel/generic-disney-descendants-%E2%80%93-teaser-trailer|title=Disney Descendants  Teaser Trailer|publisher=Disney.com.au|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson was cast to return as Evie in ''[[Descendants 2]]''.

In Justin Merz's and [[Evan Daugherty]]'s script for the live-action spin-off ''Rose Red'', currently in development, Snow White's sister Rose Red is going to &quot;join Grumpy and the fellow Dwarves on a journey to find the Evil Queen and break her curse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2016/04/04/snow-white-sister-rose-red-disney-live-action |title=Disney To Develop Live-Action Film About Snow White’s Sister Rose Red |website=Geeksofdoom.com |date=2016-04-04 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
In the 1949 audiobook release, the Queen (voiced by [[Eleanor Audley]]) wears a yellow dress and a red cape. She tells the Huntsman to take Snow White to the forest and leave her there to die. In the end of the book, after being chased by the dwarfs, the Queen dies when she slips while climbing the mountain and falls into the sea.

The novel ''Fairest of All: A Tale of the Wicked Queen'' by Serena Valentino, published by [[Disney Press]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.disney.com/book/fairest-of-all/ |title=Fairest of All &amp;#124; Disney Publishing Worldwide |publisher=Books.disney.com |date=August 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells a story much more sympathetic to the Queen than most other Disney media. The book shows how the Queen became the villain from the film, much in the style of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'', with the Magic Mirror, here possessed by the spirit of her abusive father, having been a corrupting influence. According to the book, her mother was a witch and the King died in a war against another kingdom prior to the events of the film. After her husband's death, the Queen slowly descends into madness. By the end of novel, Snow White gets the mirror and the Queen becomes the spirit inside the mirror after her death in the film.

The Queen is one of the Overtakers, villains of ''[[The Kingdom Keepers]]'' novel series. She was introduced in 2011 in the fourth book of the saga, ''Power Play'', alongside Cruella De Vil. Like Maleficent, she is very powerful and is able to cast almost any spell with a flick of her finger; she can also transform herself and other characters. In ''Power Play'', when Maleficent and [[Chernabog]] are captured by the Keepers, the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.

One chapter in [[Todd Strasser]]'s 1993 ''Disney's the Villains Collection/Stories from the Films'' is dedicated to ''Snow White'' and the Queen. She is also a subject of one of the illustrated books in the Disney Princess series ''My Side of the Story'', titled ''Snow White/The Queen'' (2004), which portrays her as a misunderstood positive character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0786834641 |title=Disney Princess: My Side of the Story – Snow White/The Queen – Book #2: Daphne Skinner, Atelier Philippe Harchy, John Kurtz: 0725961034641: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the night-time fireworks and visual hydrotechnic show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', first played in 1992, the Queen, voiced by Louise Chamis, is the main villain and the leader of all the [[Disney Villains]]. She is introduced in the second act, when her Magic Mirror (voiced by [[Tony Jay]]) tells her that there are now three princesses (Snow White, [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]] and [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]]) fairer than her. Enraged, the Queen transforms herself into a hag&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2012/10/ten-disney-villains-you-can-see-at-walt-disney-world-resort/ |title=Ten Disney Villains You Can See at Walt Disney World Resort « Disney Parks Blog |publisher=Disneyparks.disney.go.com |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the Mirror and her cauldron to summon various &quot;all the forces of evil&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sQwtEwPDLUC&amp;pg=PA202 |title=Children Under Construction: Critical Essays on Play as Curriculum – Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a collection of Disney villains to come to her aid. They include Maleficent, who transforms into a dragon. (In the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] version, she also traps [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] inside her mirror.) At the climax of the show, Mickey is able to defeat the dragon and vanquish all the villains with a magic sword. The Witch is the last to die, transforming back into the Queen before she is destroyed.

In the ''[[Disney Dream]]'' cruise ship show ''Villains Tonight!'', first played in 2010, [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] calls forth Disney's most powerful villains for help to regain his evil. The Queen, changing from the Witch form, denies his invitation since Hades also invited Maleficent, her rival for Hades' affections and for the status of &quot;the most evil in the land&quot;. The Queen claims not to be Hades' girlfriend, but they just had &quot;an interesting weekend&quot; on [[Castaway Cay]]. In the end, the Queen and Maleficent put their differences aside as all villains should stick together and advise Hades to find evil within himself, and not from others.

===Games===
The Witch is an antagonist in the unreleased ''Snow White'' game for the [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=903 |title=Atari 2600 - Snow White (Atari) |publisher=AtariAge |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001's ''Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' for the [[Game Boy Color]], the players need to solve a puzzle minigame for the Queen to consult her mirror, and later guide a deer to warn the Dwarfs and then lead the Dwarfs in pursuit of the Witch before he can go to her castle.

The Queen is one of the four Disney Villains that appear in 1999 video game ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'', voiced by Louise Chamis. [[Jiminy Cricket]] and the player venture into the worlds of the stories to restore the happy endings. In the altered (and game's final) story, where there is no Prince, the Queen (appearing in both of her forms) has built a lair resembling her poisoned apple inside the scary wood, and has put Snow White to eternal sleep in her dungeon and intends to do the same to the Seven Dwarfs. The player needs to correctly mix ingredients for several potions including the True Love Potion to magically summon the Prince and save the day. It is followed by the fight with the Queen where she tries to get away and the player has to reflect her magic ball spells, until she retreats to her lair. There, while asking her mirror, she suddenly transforms into a hag and the mirror breaks.

In 2010's video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) appears in the Dwarf Woodlands world. She recruits the protagonist [[Terra (Kingdom Hearts)|Terra]] to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information he looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses paths with him on her way to poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in [[Aqua (Kingdom Hearts)|Aqua]]'s storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.

In 2013's free-to-play mobile game ''Snow White: Queen's Return'' (also known as ''Seven Dwarfs: The Queen's Return''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcadesushi.com/best-disney-movie-apps/ |title=10 Best Disney iOS Games |publisher=Arcadesushi.com |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an uncanonical continuation of the film, the Queen has survived the fall at the climax of the film because there was a lake at the bottom of the abbyss. She then reverted to her youthful form and, seeking revenge, cast an evil curse on Snow White as well as the dwarfs and their entire forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.dwarfs_goo |title=Snow White: The Queen's Return – Android-apps op Google Play |publisher=Play.google.com |date= |accessdate=July 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330103005/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.dwarfs_goo|archivedate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's updates were supposed to allow the players to &quot;meet (and defeat)&quot; the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com/upcoming-update-what-to-expect/ |title=Upcoming update: What to expect? &amp;#124; Seven Dwarfs – The Queen's return – Complete guide to Disney's mobile game |publisher=Sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com |date=April 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding quests involving a search for her hideout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com/restoring-witch-rock/ |title=Restoring Witch Rock &amp;#124; Seven Dwarfs – The Queen's return – Complete guide to Disney's mobile |publisher=Sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com/finding-and-restoring-queens-alchemy-lab/ |title=Finding and Restoring Queen’s Alchemy Lab &amp;#124; Seven Dwarfs – The Queen's return – Complete guide to Disney's mobile |publisher=Sevendwarfs.twiddlethumb.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;help the Dwarfs rid the enchanted forest of the evil queen,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=250347941792754 |title=Tijdlijnfoto's – Seven Dwarfs: The Queen's Return |publisher=Facebook |date=April 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the story was ultimately left unresolved as the game was discontinued in May 2014.

In the 1990 video game ''[[Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse]]'', an old witch named Mizrabel takes the of the Evil Queen after draining the youth from [[Minnie Mouse]]. In 2012's ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', the previously defeated Mizrabel returns to transform into various Disney villains, including the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo-master.com/test-444.htm|title=Epic Mickey : Power of Illusion - Test Nintendo 3DS - Nintendo Master|publisher=Nintendo-master.com|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before setting on Maleficent. In 2013's [[Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse (2013 video game)|HD remake of ''Castle of Illusion'']], Mizrabel looks like a cross between the Queen and Maleficent in her youthful form and professes her ambition to be &quot;the fairest of them all&quot;.

The Evil Queen is also featured in a number of traditional games, albeit usually as a mere obstacle for the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2014/03/tek-toothbrush-snow-white-board-game.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: Tek Toothbrush 'Snow White' Board Game |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2014-03-17 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2015/10/1938-parker-brothers-snow-white-board.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: 1938 Parker Brothers Snow White Board Game |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2010/01/milton-bradley-snow-white-board-game.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: 1938 Milton Bradley Snow White Board Game |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33944/walt-disneys-snow-white-and-seven-dwarfs-game |title=Walt Disney's Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs Game &amp;#124; Board Game |publisher=BoardGameGeek |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8513/snow-white-and-seven-dwarfs |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs &amp;#124; Board Game |website=BoardGameGeek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=FC+JM+++30A |title=Délivrez Minnie ! |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date=1952-12-21 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+WDCD+52-10 |title=Castle Labyrinth |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date=1975-04-01 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=U+MM+274C |title=Name the Characters Word Puzzle |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;p&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=HC+DD2005-23S |title=En nu naar het kasteel! |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is, however, playable in some of them, such as ''Snow White and the Severn Dwarfs Game'' in the Disneykins franchise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmic-light.blogspot.com/2015/11/disneykin-snow-white-game-from-royal.html |title=Filmic Light - Snow White Archive: Disneykin Snow White Game from Royal Gelatin |website=Filmic-light.blogspot.com |date=2015-11-22 |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Disney Villains Collector's Edition Monopoly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disneystore.com/disney-villains-collectors-edition-monopolyreg-game/mp/1263881/1000260/ |title=Disney Villains Collector's Edition Monopoly® Game &amp;#124; Board Games |publisher=Disney Store |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Razzi's 1985 children's gamebook ''Snow White in the Enchanted Forest (Choose Your Own Adventure: Walt Disney #1)'' features the Prince-like character's confrontations with evil Queen as she is searching for Snow White, who is hiding with the Dwarfs, to &quot;put an end to her, once and for all!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencefictionmuseum.org/WDCYOASW/WDCYOASWPG001.htm?Pg=000 |title=SNOW WHITE PG001 |publisher=Sciencefictionmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she has much greater powers than in the film, including being able to instantly change between her hag and queen forms at will,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencefictionmuseum.org/WDCYOASW/WDCYOASWPG018.htm?Pg=008 |title=SNOW WHITE PG018 |publisher=Sciencefictionmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; magically disappear in a cloud of smoke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencefictionmuseum.org/WDCYOASW/WDCYOASWPG019.htm?Pg=018 |title=SNOW WHITE PG019 |publisher=Sciencefictionmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; change herself into an animal and back, and turn others into animals with magic beams from her hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencefictionmuseum.org/WDCYOASW/WDCYOASWPG020.htm?Pg=005 |title=SNOW WHITE PG020 |publisher=Sciencefictionmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial comic strip &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; written by [[Merrill De Maris]], one of the writers of the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=ZS+3701 |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is centred primarily around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores the source of the Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking the most beautiful woman in all the world and is shocked when he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she is going to get rid of Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a &quot;miserable hag&quot;.&lt;ref name=wdm/&gt; This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennetti.fi/sw_scariest6.html |title=THE FAIREST ...AND THE SCARIEST OF THEM ALL: The 1937 Merrill De Maris Comic Book |publisher=Kennetti.fi |date=July 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=B+CWD++++5-B |title=Branca de Neve |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |date=1969-04-01 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=ZT+115|title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|publisher=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=E+GN+93-02|title=Blanche Neige et les sept nains|publisher=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a number of comics set in the film's world.

Many of the ''Topolino'' Snow White comics were the works of [[Romano Scarpa]]. His 1986 comic &quot;The Seven Dwarfs and King Arbor's Crystal&quot; (''I Sette Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor'') provides explanation how the Queen would have survived her apparent death in the film (as some branches and bushes eased the fall and she was rescued by her loyal guards) and why she could not change back to her normal self (as her castle was burned down by the Huntsman and her book of magic is gone). In this story, Grimhilde (Grimilde) enlists the aid of her great admirer and past suitor, the evil King Arbor of Vegetalia, in a plot to use a magic crystal device to swap her old body with Snow White's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL+1571-A|title=I 7 Nani e il cristallo di Re Arbor|publisher=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/romano-scarpa/i-sette-nani-e-il-cristallo-di-re-arbor-AtTBgZb3p6ILxeoWUkWcDg2|title=I Sette Nani e il cristallo di re Arbor|publisher=Artnet.com|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intrigue is foiled by the dwarves who destroy the crystal, and the resigned Arbor allows the Witch to live with her, saying he will try to remember she ''was'' &quot;the most beautiful among queens&quot;. The uneasy relationship between Grimhilde and Abor continued in the comic &quot;The Seven Dwarfs and the Fountainhead&quot; (''I Sette nani e la fonte meravigliosa''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lospaziobianco.it/3104-set-romano-scarpa|title=Sul set di Romano Scarpa|author=Luca Boschi|work=Lo Spazio Bianco|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL+1622-A|title=I 7 Nani e la fonte meravigliosa|publisher=Coa.inducks.org|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she desperately attempts to regain her youth, but instead only turns into a childlike version of her Witch form for a short time.

The Queen begs the High Witch for mercy and is given a magic wand with the power of transformation, but if she would not succeed this time she will be turned into a magic broom for a more &quot;honorable&quot; witch to fly. The Queen uses the wand to gain trust of Snow White and turn her a figurine, than takes the princess' form to ambush the dwarfs and do the same with them, and waits for the Prince's arrival to kill him. Only Dopey escapes and eventually manages to outwit the Queen, using her want to restore his friends and transform her into a figurine, which later turns into a broom when her sentence is carried over.

She takes on many forms trying to thwart them in various ways, and one-by-one the dwarfs sacrifice their lives, until only Dopey remains but he manages to get hold of magical water that brings back all of them to life. The freed fairy's magic makes the cavern collapse down on the helpless Queen to make sure she will never hurt anyone again.

But Dopey infiltrates her castle, frees Snow White, and locks up the Queen in her laboratory set ablaze, after which the whole castle is consumed by fire and explodes after the dwarf and the princess escape.

The Queen also appears as one of the villains in the 2005 Disney manga series ''[[Kilala Princess]]'' by Rika Tanaka and Nao Kodaka, where the protagonists Rei and Kilala Reno find themselves in the world of Snow White, and meet and befriend the princess. They go the Queen's castle to ask the Magic Mirror how to find Kilala's friend Erika, but discover the Queen is still alive (and even commanding the two vultures, as well as wolves) as she appears and demands Kilala's magical tiara. The children try to flee but are attacked by wolves and locked up in the dungeon, where the Queen transforms into the Witch and prepares to turn Kilala into an ugly creature. Snow White appears and agrees to sacrifice herself to save them, but Kilala stops her at last moment before she can eat a poison apple; Rei then attacks the Queen, who falls into her cauldron, turns into a vulture, and flies away in a defeat.

An almost entirely alternate take on the character of the Evil Queen is Regina Mills, the main antagonist in the first season of the 2011 Disney ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) live-action TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' where she is played by [[Lana Parrilla]]. Regina is the mayor of the idyllic town of Storybrooke, Maine, but is secretly the Evil Queen of legend, having cursed many beloved fairytale characters to live in a land without magic, where they will never get their happy endings. The show is not directly based on the Disney animated films, but is inspired by them and makes many references to them. One of its episodes is titled &quot;[[The Evil Queen (Once Upon a Time)|The Evil Queen]]&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception and popularity===
The Disney version of the character was very well received by film critics, even as some were disturbed (columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] for instance urged Disney to not make future villains as scary as the Witch&lt;ref name=s50/&gt;). [[Stephen Hunter]] included her being &quot;cool&quot; among the &quot;wonderful truths about ''Snow White''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19930705&amp;id=FSZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_k4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1345,1366153 'Snow White' still a four star movie: Truths, tidbits and magic], ''Bangor Daily News'', July 5, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] wrote the film's Snow White &quot;exists only to be victimized by her wicked stepmother - a far more interesting character. The image of the wicked Queen (initially conceived as a raven-haired glamour girl, and the epitome of late-1930s sophistication) who drinks an aging potion and then shrivels, sprouting warts and claws, turning before our eyes from a sexy, voluptous creature into a freightening old crone, must leave as powerful an impression on the audience as Snow White's chirpy feminity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19870719&amp;id=mEhOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vhMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6358,1096898 'Snow White' launched an art], ''Star-News'', July 19, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was &quot;not so much about Snow White as it was about the Seven Dwarfs and the Evil Queen,&quot; opining this was the reason it has remained &quot;the ultimate animated masterpiece&quot; by 2001 instead of having been forgotten soon after its premiere in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20011014&amp;id=OFtTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5278,3343942 Disney's 'Snow White' is the ultimate animated masterpiece], ''The Victoria Advocate'', October 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morgan McMichaels (Evil Queen).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Morgan McMichaels]] dressed as the Queen in 2015]]

Feminism academic [[Camille Paglia]] said that she used to be transfixed by this &quot;temperamental diva bitch&quot;, due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: &quot;[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. I thought she was fabulous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Nation and Samuel Wells, ''Faithfulness and Fortitude: Conversations with the Theological Ethics of Stanley Hauerwas'', page 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Lana Parrilla]], who later herself played the Evil Queen in ''Once Upon A Time'', said that whenever she watched Disney's ''Snow White'' as a young girl she rooted for and &quot;loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She was just so fascinating to me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez |first=Lee |url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/tv/exclusive-once-upon-time-star-lana-parrilla-reveals-her-favorite-fairy-tale-charact#axzz2e1UT49HV |title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Once Upon A Time' Star Lana Parrilla Reveals Her Favorite Fairy Tale Characters |publisher=Latina |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Deborah Lipp]] wrote: &quot;As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror ''now!''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipp, ''The Study of Witchcraft: A Guidebook to Advanced Wicca'', page 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Film director [[John Waters (director born 1946)|John Waters]] said he too rooted for the evil queen to win,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covert |first=Colin |url=http://www.popmatters.com/article/john-waters-talks-and-talks-about-his-subversive-career/ |title=John Waters talks (and talks) about his subversive career |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chay Yew]] said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from ''Snow White''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mapa on the spot&quot;, ''The Advocate'', February 18, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Once Upon the Time'' co-creator [[Adam Horowitz]] said that his earliest Disney memory was seeing a re-release of Disney's ''Snow White'' when he was &quot;terrified by the Evil Queen while also being unable to look away and that stuck with me through the years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/articles/2013/10/09/a-chat-with-the-creators-of-once-upon-a-time-in-wonderland/ |title=A Chat with the Creators of Once Upon a Time in Wonderland &amp;#124; Disney Insider |publisher=Blogs.disney.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, fashion designer and [[Angelina Jolie]]'s ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' collaborator [[Stella McCartney]] said: &quot;My favorite Disney film was ''Snow White''. I remember growing up watching [it] and being completely freaked out by that scene where the evil queen becomes the old witch and she makes the poison apple.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/stella-mccartney-on-angelina-disney-witches.html |title=Stella McCartney on Disney Villains and Angelina Jolie – The Cut |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film maker and actor [[Terry Gilliam]] listed the film's Queen among his eight favourite villains, commenting how &quot;truly strange&quot; is that &quot;vanity and beauty are what she's all about, yet the identity she assumes when she becomes the old beggar woman is practically the ugliest in all the kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;An interview in the February 1982 issue of ''Heavy Metal''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy tale lecturer [[Jack Zipes]] alike noted that &quot;it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, for the picture of Snow White reveals that she is a pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest.&quot;&lt;ref name=enchanted/&gt;

===Cultural impact===
[[File:Solweig Rediger-Lizlow - Cannes.JPG|thumb|upright|left|French model and TV host Solweig Rediger-Lizlow dressed as the Queen at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

According to [[Maria Tatar]], an academic specializing in children's literature, the film turned &quot;the evil queen into a figure of gripping narrative energy and makes Snow White [the character] so dull that she requires a supporting cast of seven to enliven her scenes. Ultimately it is the stepmother's disruptive, disturbing, and divisive presence that invests the film with a degree of fascination that has facilitated its widespread circulation and that has allowed it to take such powerful hold in our own culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Charles Kors]] and [[Edward Peter]] credited the Queen's character's influence in changing the popular visual image of witches in film and other fiction as specifically female, more often young and attractive than old and ugly, and dressed in a characteristically defining costume.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Charles Kors and Edward Peter, ''Witchcraft in Europe: 1100–1700: A Documentary History'', University of Pennsylvania Press 2001, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; A part of [[Maila Nurmi]]'s inspiration for her character of Vampira came from Nurmi being fascinated by the Queen after watching Disney's ''Snow White'' at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Skal, ''The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror'', page 240.&lt;/ref&gt; When she was cast for the 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], [[Gale Sondergaard]] (who herself has earlier served as one of inspirations for Disney) insisted on playing a glamorous vision of the character, similar to the Disney's interpretation of the Queen from ''Snow White''; when Sondergaard's idea was rejected by producers [[Mervyn LeRoy]] and [[Arthur Freed]] in favor of making the Wicked Witch ugly, she withdrew from the project and [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] was cast instead.&lt;ref name=gg/&gt; Still, the similarities between the two films, including the porteayals on their respective witch characters, were such that ''The Wizard of Oz'' was at one point advertised as &quot;''Snow White'' with live actors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Stillman and Jay Scarfone, ''The Wizardry of Oz: The Artistry and Magic of The 1939 MGM Classic'' (Applause Theatre Book Publishers, United States, 2004).

An abandoned concept from ''Snow White'' was that the Queen kidnap the Prince and lock him in her dungeon; similarly, in ''Sleeping Beauty'', Maleficent kidnaps Prince Philip.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Allan, ''Walt Disney and Europe'' (Indiana University Press, Indiana, 1999). ISBN 0-253-21353-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Bane, a vain evil sorceress from ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'', too bears a similarity to the Evil Queen in her costume and character.

The Queen's character design from the film was also used in some other Snow White adaptations, such as for the Queen in the Turkish film ''Pamuk Prenses ve Yedi Cüceler'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/radikal.aspx?atype=radikaldetayv3&amp;articleid=934341&amp;categoryid=42 |title=Sinemanın gerçek cadısı – Radikal Radikal İki |publisher=Radikal.com.tr |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Queen Naga in Italian erotic comic books ''[[Biancaneve]]'' was at first loosely based on the Disney version, as was its Snow White's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvifrance.fr/images/couvertures/ContesMalicieux/Biancaneve.htm |title=Biancaneve |publisher=Elvifrance.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groovyageofhorror.tumblr.com/post/112218207086/biancaneve-pt-3 |title=Groovy Age of Horror — BIANCANEVE, Pt. 3 |publisher=Groovyageofhorror.tumblr.com |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sarandon]]'s character of Queen Narissa in Disney's own ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' (2007), had her characteristics, powers, and physical features were inspired by the Queen from the film and by Maleficent from ''Sleeping Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |title=''Enchanted'' princess steps out of cartoon, into Manhattan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-11-14-enchanted_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=November 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on into the project, ''Enchanted'' was actually supposed to be a direct-to-video animated sequel to Disney's ''Snow White'' (with a working title of &quot;''Snow White 2''&quot;) in which Narissa (back then often misspelled as &quot;Noriss&quot;) was the evil Queen's sister who would kidnap six of the dwarfs to lure Snow White, the Prince, and their 13-year-old daughter Rose aided by Dopey, into a trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Olivier Mouroux |url=http://famillemouroux.free.fr/News.html |title=Animated Movies |publisher=Famillemouroux.free.fr |date= |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Filmation]] announced their own animated sequel to the fairy tale, the studio was sued by Disney until Filmation promised their characters would not resemble the ones from the Disney film; the settlement stated there could not be a &quot;wicked witch&quot; character in the film which instead was made to feature the Queen's brother in a vendetta to avenge her death (the title was also changed, from ''Snow White in the Land of Doom'' to ''[[Happily Ever After (1993 film)|Happily Ever After]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19900601&amp;id=CnMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tIgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3607,287334 Did Snow White Live 'Happily Ever After'?], ''The Daily Gazette'', January 1, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;SNOW WHITE REVISITED: THE QUEEN'S DEAD, BUT CONFLICT ISN'T BANISHED&quot;. ''Dayton Daily News'', May 28, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's castle was used prominently in the advertising of the film (acting as the backdrop of the film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''Sleeping Beauty'', ''The Little Mermaid'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''Aladdin'', feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for [[Buena Vista International]].

===Homage cameos and parodies===
[[File:Disney Villainess Squad at WonderCon 2010 Masquerade 5.JPG|thumb|The &quot;Disney Villainess Squad&quot; cosplayers at [[WonderCon]] 2010]]

The character has also made several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program ''[[This Is My Best]]'', the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood was nothing but a heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In [[Woody Allen]]'s live-action film ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's ''Snow White'', he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by [[Diane Keaton]], talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her [[Menstrual cycle|period]] [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/annie_hall.html |title=Annie Hall script by Woody Allen |publisher=Dailyscript.com |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen was referenced when she appeared as a villain in an issue of Italian horror comic book series ''[[Dylan Dog]]'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/issue/44258/&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Four Great Women and a Manicure]]&quot; (2009), the Queen escapes the dwarves after poisoning Snow White, only to be lynched by a mob of angry woodland creatures.&lt;ref name=FF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&amp;ID=4832 |title=May is Massive on Fox |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |publisher=FoxFlash |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412221337/http://foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z1z25z1z8&amp;ID=4832 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' two-part cartoon &quot;Snow Wade and the 77 Dwarves&quot;, Lanolin appears as the Wicked Queen with a costume is based off the Disney version.
