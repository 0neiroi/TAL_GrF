		While

		Then she was arrested and went to jail for soliciting , leaving
Nick	PERSON	with custody of her two sons ,

		Maboud really was in the employ of the boys ' parents , who were wealthy foreigners with many enemies .

Countess Wilhelmina	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Later ,

Gabi	PERSON	's daughter

		* from soapcentral.com '' ` Fantômas '' ' -LRB- -RRB- is a fictional character created by French writers
Marcel Allain	PERSON	#NOM?
Pierre Souvestre	PERSON	-LRB- 1874-1914 -RRB- .
		
		One of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction , Fantômas was created in
1911	DATE	and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators , then a subsequent 11 volumes written by
Allain	PERSON	alone after
Souvestre	ORGANIZATION	's death .
		
		The character was also the basis of various film , television , and comic book adaptations .
		
		In the history of crime fiction , he represents a transition from Gothic novel villains of the
19th century	DATE	to modern-day serial killers .
		
		The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of
Hollywood	LOCATION	", in two respects : First , the authors distributed the writing among themselves ; their `` working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other , meeting up to tie the two-halves of the story together in the final chapter . ''"
		
		This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month .
		
		Second , the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up .
		
		Such a system ensured that the film studio could produce sequels reliably .
		
		New Fantomas stories set in period are currently appearing in Bold Venture Press ' pulp magazine AWESOMED Tales .
		
		The popular depiction of Fantômas as wearing a blue mask , black gloves , and using technological devices did not originate in the novels , but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fantômas movies directed by
André Hunebelle	PERSON	in the
1960s	DATE	.
		
		The trilogy , which started in
1963	DATE	with Fantômas -LRB-
1964	DATE	film -RRB- | Fantômas , departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone , and by making Fantômas -LRB- played by
Jean Marais	PERSON	-RRB- more of a James Bond enemy .
		
		Despite these discrepancies , the blue-masked Fantômas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered .
		
		.
		
		Fantômas wears his iconic black hood and black leotard , more sinister features than the traditional gentleman thief 's domino mask and tuxedo .
		
		Fantômas is a criminal genius , ruthless and particularly elusive .
		
		As described by Schütt -LRB- 2003 -RRB- in her analysis of French crime fiction literature ,
Fantômas	PERSON	is the cause of almost any unsolved crime , a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone .
		
		He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve , who is generally the only one able to see
Fantômas	ORGANIZATION	's tracks .
		
		Fantômas was introduced a few years after
Arsène Lupin	PERSON	, another well-known thief .
		
		But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder , Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion .
		
		He is totally ruthless , gives no mercy , and is loyal to none , not even his own children .
		
		He is a master of disguise , always appearing under an assumed identity , often that of a person whom he has murdered .
		
		Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes , such as plague-infested rats , giant snakes , and rooms that fill with sand .
		
		Fantômas 's background remains vague .
		
		He might be of British and/or French ancestry .
		
		He appears to have been born in
1867	DATE	.
		
		In the books , it is established that c.
1892	DATE	, the man who later became Fantômas called himself
Archduke Juan North	ORGANIZATION	and operated in the German Principality of Hesse-Weimar .
		
		There he fathered a child ,
Vladimir	PERSON	, with an unidentified noblewoman .
		
		In circumstances unrevealed , he was arrested and sent to prison .
		
		C.
1895	DATE	, Fantômas was in
India	LOCATION	.
		
		There , an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl ,
Hélène	PERSON	, whose father might be Fantômas or an Indian Prince who was Fantômas ' acolyte .
		
		The girl was raised in
South Africa	LOCATION	.
		
		In
1897	DATE	, Fantômas was in the
United States of America	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	.
		
		There , he ruined his then-business partner ,
Etienne Rambert	PERSON	.
		
		In
1899	DATE	, he fought in the Second Boer War in
South Africa	LOCATION	under the name of Gurn .
		
		He fought in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	as an artillery sergeant under the command of
Lord Roberts	PERSON	.
		
		He became aide-de-camp to
Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill	ORGANIZATION	and fell in love with his younger wife , Lady
Maud Beltham	PERSON	.
		
		Upon their return to
Europe	LOCATION	, soon before the first novel begins -LRB- c.
1900	DATE	-RRB- ,
Gurn	PERSON	and Lady Beltham were surprised in their
Paris	LOCATION	love nest ,
Rue Levert	LOCATION	, by her husband .
		
		Lord
Beltham	PERSON	was about to shoot
Maud when Gurn	PERSON	hit him with a hammer then strangled him .
		
		Fantômas then impersonated
Etienne Rambert	PERSON	and framed his son ,
Charles	PERSON	, for a murder he had committed .
		
		As Etienne , he persuaded
Charles	PERSON	to go into hiding , but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve , truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas .
		
		Juve knew that
Charles	PERSON	was innocent and gave him a new identity : journalist
Jerôme Fandor	PERSON	who is employed at the newspaper '' La Capitale '' .
		
		Juve later arrested
Gurn	PERSON	and , at his trial , brought forward a convincing argument that
Gurn	PERSON	and Fantômas were one and the same , though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case .
		
		On the eve of his execution , Gurn/Fant ômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was guillotined in his place .
		
		Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes .
		
		She eventually committed suicide in
1910	DATE	.
		
		Fandor fell in love with
Hélène	PERSON	and , despite
Fantômas	PERSON	's repeated attempts to break them up , married her .
		
		Fantômas 's evil son ,
Vladimir	PERSON	, reappeared in
1911	DATE	.
		
		Vladimir 's girlfriend was murdered by
Fantômas	PERSON	and
Vladimir	PERSON	himself was eventually shot by
Juve	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the
1960s	DATE	the Mexican comics publisher Editorial
Novaro	PERSON	produced a '' Fantomas , La Amenaza Elegante '' -LRB- Fantomas , the Elegant Threat -RRB- comic book series that became popular throughout
Latin America	LOCATION	.
		
		This was apparently meant to be the same character , although rewritten as a hero , and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films .
		
		Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics .
		
		It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission .
		
		This Fantômas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it , and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses .
		
		The character was also pursued by the authorities , in his case mainly by a French police inspector named
Gerard	PERSON	.
		
		His mask in the Latin American version - which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal '' Diabolik '' - and his use of it , seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by Mexican wrestling .
		
		The Latin American Fantômas mixed Italian and Mexican styles creating a wikt : hybrid | hybrid - just as the flag of
Mexico	LOCATION	and the flag of
Italy	LOCATION	are made different by the central emblem of the Aztec pictogram for
Tenochtitlan	LOCATION	on the Mexican flag .
		
		The French character wore a black mask like his Italian inspiration , the Latin American a white mask like Mexican wrestling hero Santo -LRB- literally ` saint ' in Spanish -RRB- -
Italy	LOCATION	faces
Africa	LOCATION	home to a majority Black population ,
Mexico	LOCATION	the
United States	LOCATION	mostly with a majority White population .
		
		These characters had to remain relevant and mysterious to their specific geographical regions to survive and succeed .
		
		Apparently the series was also influenced by the '' James Bond '' movies , as Fantômas , equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor
Semo	PERSON	, had all kind of adventures around the world , and even fought other , more cruel criminals .
		
		The Latin American Fantômas , created in
Mexico	LOCATION	, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American
Hugh Hefner	PERSON	, who created '' Playboy '' magazine , with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo .
		
		A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences , mostly prepubescent and adolescents males .
		
		Latino Fantômas also was a millionaire , owning several corporations under assumed identities , had secret headquarters outside
Paris	LOCATION	, and was assisted by several secret agents , including the 12 `` Zodiac Girls '' , beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively , known only by their codenames - the signs of the zodiac .
		
		The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their femininity and preceding
Charlie	PERSON	's Angels by decades .
		
		Although cancelled years ago -LRB-
Novaro	ORGANIZATION	folded in
1985	DATE	, and a character revival by rival Grupo Editorial Vid in
Mexico	LOCATION	in the
1990s	DATE	did not last long -RRB- , it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both
Central America	LOCATION	and

Latin America	LOCATION	's favorite comic characters .

		Judex was himself featured in various adaptations , sequels and remakes .

Kate	PERSON	discover a case , carried on the plane by the
Marshall	PERSON	, and the two constantly fight over its ownership , until

		Soon after ,
Sawyer	PERSON	becomes constantly harassed by a boar , and seeks
Kate	PERSON	's help in finding it .
		
		Upon cornering it , however ,
Sawyer	PERSON	decides to let it go .
		
		After learning about
Michael	PERSON	's plan to build a raft ,
Sawyer	PERSON	asks for a place on board , to which he is granted .
		
		However , after someone -LRB- later revealed as Walt -RRB- sets the raft on fire ,
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Michael blame Jin-Soo Kwon | Jin	PERSON	and
Sawyer	PERSON	takes him to the beach with the intent of beating him .
		
		Once the matter is solved ,
Sawyer	PERSON	experiences headaches and , after consulting
Jack	PERSON	, is prescribed reading glasses , made from pairs found in the wreckage .
		
		His voice also calms the newborn of survivor
Claire	PERSON	.
		
		The day before the raft sets sail ,
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	clash once more , this time over his place on the raft .
		
		While
Kate	PERSON	placed a good argument ,
Sawyer	PERSON	revealed his past life as a criminal to the survivors , securing his space on the raft .
		
		The next day ,
Sawyer	PERSON	,
Michael	PERSON	,
Walt	PERSON	and Jin set sail on the raft .
		
		When a piece of the raft breaks off ,
Sawyer	PERSON	is the first in the water to retrieve and re-attach it .
		
		He also begins reading through the survivors ' personal messages , kept in a bottle .
		
		That night , they encounter a small boat and begin celebrating their rescue .
		
		However , they soon reveal themselves as the Others , and demand they hand over

Sawyer	PERSON	is shot in the shoulder before the raft is destroyed by the Others , who leave with Walt .
		
		=
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Michael	PERSON	are stranded at sea with the wreckage of the raft .

		Once the mishap is cleared ,
Sawyer	PERSON	,
Michael	PERSON	and Jin are released and forced into leading them to the fuselage camp .
		
		Throughout the journey ,
Sawyer	PERSON	constantly clashes with leader
Ana Lucia	PERSON	, until he passes out from his bullet wound .
		
		He is then carried via hand-made stretcher until the death of
Shannon	LOCATION	, where he is carried by Mr.
Eko	PERSON	into the hatch .
		
		He is cared for by
Kate	PERSON	, until her father ,
Wayne	PERSON	, is channeled through
Sawyer	PERSON	.
		
		Upon recovering ,
Sawyer	PERSON	reluctantly must seek
Jack	PERSON	's medical expertise on a regular basis .
		
		On one such occasion ,
Sawyer	PERSON	releases
Jack	PERSON	and
Locke	PERSON	from the armory after
Michael	PERSON	locks them in to search for Walt alone .
		
		Sawyer agrees to join them as they follow , only to encounter the Others .
		
		After revealing to have
Kate	PERSON	held hostage ,
Sawyer	PERSON	,
Jack	PERSON	and
Locke	PERSON	reluctantly hand over their guns for her safety .
		
		Unlike
Jack	PERSON	,
Sawyer	PERSON	sympathizes with
Kate	PERSON	's actions .
		
		Soon after ,
Sawyer	PERSON	sets up a long con , with the help of
Charlie	PERSON	, in order to gain possession of the camp 's entire firearms and medicine , using
Sun-Hwa Kwon	PERSON	| Sun as a victim of a faked abduction attempt .
		
		Upon succeeding this feat ,
Sawyer	PERSON	is challenged by
Jack	PERSON	to a game of poker with the medicine as the prize , which
Jack	PERSON	wins .
		
		Sawyer later gives Sun a pregnancy test upon request , and informs
Bernard	PERSON	and Jin about her suspected pregnancy .
		
		
Sawyer	PERSON	also uses his possession of the medicine to his advantage , and mocks Hugo `` Hurley '' Reyes |
Hurley	PERSON	when he admits to seeing things , only for his tirade to backfire .
		
		He also refuses to help
Bernard	PERSON	create an S.O.S. sign on the beach .
		
		He is soon confronted by
Ana Lucia	LOCATION	, demanding he give her a gun .
		
		She seduces him , and steals his own gun from him .
		
		Upon discovering this ,
Sawyer	PERSON	, along with
Jack	PERSON	,
Locke	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	, head for the hatch , where they discover
Michael	PERSON	injured , Libby fatally wounded and
Ana Lucia	LOCATION	already dead .
		
		Michael asks
Sawyer	PERSON	if he will go with him to the Others ' camp , to which he agrees .
		
		After the funeral of
Ana Lucia	LOCATION	and
Libby	LOCATION	,
Sawyer	PERSON	joins
Michael	PERSON	,
Jack	PERSON	,
Kate	PERSON	and
Hurley	PERSON	on the trek , where they are suddenly ambushed by the Others , tied up and taken to a pier .
		
		While

Hurley	PERSON	is released ,
Sawyer	PERSON	is taken away by the Others , along with
Jack	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	.
		
		=
Sawyer	PERSON	wakes in the Others ' camp , imprisoned in a cage originally designed to hold polar bears .
		
		Karl , a teenager being held in the cage across from
Sawyer	PERSON	's , helps
Sawyer	PERSON	to figure out the mechanism in his cage so he can gain access to food and water .
		
		Karl then helps him to escape , but
Juliet shoots Sawyer	PERSON	in the neck with a tranquilizer dart and he is returned to his cage .
		
		Karl is taken away , and
Kate	PERSON	is placed in the cage vacated by Karl .
		
		Sawyer and
Kate	PERSON	are forced to mine and haul rocks for the Others .
		
		During this manual labor ,
Sawyer	PERSON	kisses
Kate	PERSON	, even though he gets beaten for it by
Danny Pickett	PERSON	.
		
		
Pickett	PERSON	, one of the Others , dislikes
Sawyer	PERSON	, blaming him for the death of his wife .
		
		Sawyer and
Kate	PERSON	concoct an escape plan , but they are prevented from acting on it when
Sawyer	PERSON	is knocked unconscious by
Ben	PERSON	.
		
		The Others operate on
Sawyer	PERSON	, implanting a pacemaker which will malfunction and kill him if his heart rate exceeds 140 beats per minute .
		
		He is told if he does not cooperate ,
Kate	PERSON	will be given a pacemaker too .
		
		Because of this ,
Sawyer	PERSON	does not defend himself when
Pickett	PERSON	violently beats him up .
		
		Later ,
Sawyer	PERSON	nearly dies -LRB- supposedly -RRB- after
Kate	PERSON	turns her back to him in her cage and starts undressing .
		
		Sawyer sees this and his pacemaker beats rapidly .
		
		Kate asks him what this sound is and
Sawyer	PERSON	lies , saying that it is his watch and tells her to ` put some clothes on ' .
		
		Kate realizes she can slip out between top bars of her cage , but
Sawyer	PERSON	refuses to escape with her .
		
		Instead of fleeing on her own , she returns to her cage .
		
		Later ,
Ben	PERSON	reveals to
Sawyer	PERSON	that he has been conned , and there is no pacemaker in his heart .
		
		Ben informs
Sawyer	PERSON	they are on a smaller island , separated by a stretch of open ocean from the island on which their plane crashed .
		
		Sawyer realizes how inescapable the island is , and is returned to his cage .
		
		Kate opens
Sawyer	PERSON	's cell but
Sawyer	PERSON	again refused to leave , knowing how futile it would be to try .
		
		They have sex , and while
Ben	PERSON	is unconscious , having a tumor removed by
Jack	PERSON	,
Pickett	PERSON	takes the opportunity to finally kill
Sawyer	PERSON	.
		
		However ,
Jack	PERSON	threatens to let
Ben	PERSON	die unless
Kate	PERSON	and
Sawyer	PERSON	are released .
		
		Sawyer turns the tables on
Pickett	ORGANIZATION	, beats him up , and he and
Kate	PERSON	escape .
		
		
Alex Rousseau	PERSON	helps them hide in the jungle in return for freeing Karl -LRB- her boyfriend -RRB- , and gives them a canoe to escape in .
		
		Right before they leave the beach ,
Pickett	PERSON	finally catches up with them , but is shot dead by
Juliet	PERSON	, who
Ben	PERSON	ordered to help them escape .
		
		Back on the main island ,
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	argue over his decision to leave
Jack	PERSON	behind -LRB- and also to let Karl go free -RRB- .
		
		At the survivors ' camp ,
Sawyer	PERSON	keeps his distance from
Kate	PERSON	and has a beer-fueled joyriding session with
Hurley	PERSON	,
Jin	PERSON	, and
Charlie	PERSON	in an abandoned
Dharma	LOCATION	truck
Hurley	PERSON	found in the jungle .
		
		Back at camp he discovers
Kate	PERSON	has gone off with Sayid and
Locke	PERSON	in order to rescue

		He and
Hurley	PERSON	develop a friendship , often playing table tennis together .
		
		Hurley surprises
Sawyer	PERSON	by announcing with
Jack	PERSON	,
Locke	PERSON	,
Kate	PERSON	, and Sayid gone , the rest of the survivors are looking to
Sawyer	PERSON	to lead them .
		
		Sawyer rises to the challenge and bonds with the other survivors .
		
		When
Kate	PERSON	and
Jack	PERSON	finally return ,
Sawyer	PERSON	is outraged they have brought Juliet along .
		
		He and Sayid attempt to get information on the Others out of her , but they ultimately fail .
		
		Sawyer resumes his relationship with
Kate	PERSON	but suspects she is using him to make
Jack	PERSON	jealous .
		
		One night
Locke	PERSON	tells
Sawyer	PERSON	that he has captured
Ben	PERSON	, and takes
Sawyer	PERSON	to the '' Black Rock '' , locking him in a room with a bound and gagged stranger .
		
		This man , not
Ben	PERSON	, reveals he is
Anthony Cooper	PERSON	-LRB-
Locke	PERSON	's father -RRB- , a conman who also goes under the name ``
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	. ''
		
		
Sawyer	PERSON	realizes this is the man whom he has been searching for and , after
Cooper	PERSON	mocks his letter of vengeance ,
Sawyer	PERSON	strangles him to death in a fit of anger .
		
		With no more use for the nickname `` Sawyer , '' he begins to call himself James again , though others continue to refer to him as
Sawyer	PERSON	.
		
		Locke presents him with a tape showing
Juliet	PERSON	is still working for
Ben	PERSON	, and the Others are preparing a raid on the survivors .
		
		When
Sawyer	PERSON	shows the tape to
Jack	PERSON	at their camp ,
Jack	PERSON	reveals he knows about the raid , and
Juliet	PERSON	has been working with him to double-cross the Others .
		
		Sawyer and several survivors hike across the jungle to the radio tower , but
Sayid	LOCATION	,
Jin	PERSON	, and
Bernard	PERSON	stay behind to thwart the Others and end up captured .
		
		Sawyer decides to go back with
Juliet	PERSON	to rescue them .
		
		With the help of
Hurley	PERSON	and the
Dharma	LOCATION	truck , their rescue is a complete success .
		
		Two of the Others are killed and the third ,
Tom	PERSON	, is captured before

		#NOM?
Charlie	PERSON	's death ,
Sawyer	PERSON	attempts to comfort
Hurley	PERSON	, though his efforts are rejected .
		
		Although originally unsure of the meaning of
Charlie	PERSON	's dying message , `` Not Penny 's Boat , '' when the survivors split
Sawyer	PERSON	chooses to go with
Locke	PERSON	to the Barracks , telling
Kate	PERSON	he was simply doing what he 's always done : surviving .
		
		While holding
Kate	PERSON	hostage in
Ben	PERSON	's house on
Locke	PERSON	's orders ,
Sawyer	PERSON	tells
Kate	PERSON	he does n't wish to return to the real world , seeing as he has nothing for him back there .
		
		He then proceeds to tell
Kate	PERSON	she should do the same , and that they could try to start a life on the island .
		
		Kate and
Sawyer	PERSON	sleep together but she leaves after
Sawyer	PERSON	is relieved that she is n't pregnant , reasoning that they would n't be able to handle a baby .
		
		They have an argument and part on bad terms as
Kate	PERSON	returns to the beach .
		
		Later on , a group of people from the boat arrive at the barracks to capture
Ben	PERSON	.
		
		Ben ,
Locke	PERSON	,
Hurley	PERSON	and
Aaron	PERSON	take refuge in
Ben	PERSON	's house and they barricade the door .
		
		Sawyer runs to retrieve
Claire	PERSON	who is still sleeping alone in her house and watches in horror as it is blown up by the Freighters .
		
		He finds Claire alive under the ruins and proceeds to run back to
Ben	PERSON	's house .
		
		After
Alex	PERSON	is murdered by
Keamy	PERSON	and
Ben	PERSON	unleashes the smoke monster on the attackers ,
Sawyer	PERSON	decides to go back to
Jack	PERSON	and the others on the beach .
		
		Claire ,
Aaron	PERSON	and Miles go with him .
		
		
Hurley	PERSON	was going to go with
Sawyer	PERSON	as well , but
Locke	PERSON	, pointing a gun at
Sawyer	LOCATION	, forces Hugo to stay with him .
		
		After
Sawyer	PERSON	warns
Locke	PERSON	not to hurt `` a single hair on his -LSB- Hugo 's -RSB- curly head , '' he leads the rest of the group back to the beach .
		
		Sawyer ,
Claire	PERSON	and Miles soon come across the bodies of
Danielle	LOCATION	and Karl .
		
		After leaving the area , they decide to settle down to make camp , however during the night
Claire	PERSON	takes off into the jungle .
		
		Sawyer wakes up the following morning and Miles tells him
Claire	PERSON	walked into the jungle in the middle of the night with someone she called `` Dad '' .
		
		A short while later he hears
Aaron	PERSON	crying and runs off to find him alone in the jungle .
		
		Sawyer and Miles , along with
Aaron	PERSON	, continue on where they meet
Jack	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	in a small field .
		
		Jack and
Kate	PERSON	were in the process of moving towards the helicopter from the freighter , with
Jack	PERSON	inadvertently thinking the dropped satellite phone from Frank was a message to follow the crew .
		
		Sawyer then informs
Jack	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	that
Claire	PERSON	walked off and the freighter 's crew are up to no good .
		
		He hands
Aaron	PERSON	over to
Kate	PERSON	and tells her to go back to the beach with Miles and the infant , while he insists on going with
Jack	PERSON	to face
Charles Widmore	PERSON	's men .
		
		The two then find the helicopter , discover Frank handcuffed to the seats , and are told the men are heading towards
Ben	PERSON	.
		
		Sawyer then tells
Jack	PERSON	that
Hurley	PERSON	is with
Ben	PERSON	and the two head off to rescue
Hurley	PERSON	.
		
		Jack and
Sawyer	PERSON	eventually find
Hurley	PERSON	and
Locke	PERSON	at the Dharma_Initiative #Station_6 : _ The_Orchid | Dharma Orchid station .
		
		After
Jack	PERSON	finishes talking with
Locke	PERSON	,
Sawyer	PERSON	and
Hurley	PERSON	meet up with
Kate	PERSON	,
Sayid	PERSON	, and Frank at the helicopter .
		
		En route to the freighter Frank notices that the helicopter is quickly losing fuel due to a bullet hole in the gas tank .
		
		The passengers ditch all unnecessary items to lighten the load , but
Frank	PERSON	declares it will not be enough .
		
		Sawyer whispers something to
Kate	PERSON	, he gives her a goodbye kiss , and he then bails out of the helicopter to give the others a chance of escape .
		
		Sawyer swims back to the
Island	LOCATION	and encounters
Juliet	PERSON	, who directs his attention to smoke coming from the ruins of the freighter .
		
		As the two lie on the beach drinking rum they disappear with the vanished

Aaron	PERSON	#NOM?
Island	LOCATION	, flashforwards in `` Something Nice Back Home '' reveal
Kate	PERSON	is doing undisclosed favors for
Sawyer	PERSON	, who , according to
Jack	PERSON	, `` chose to stay on the island '' .
		
		= Before the strange flash ,
James	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	meet up with
Charlotte	LOCATION	, Miles ,
Rose	PERSON	,
Bernard	PERSON	and the other 815 survivors and they discover their camp is somehow missing .
		
		James is then introduced to
Daniel Faraday	PERSON	, who tells him the camps are not gone but that it has n't been built yet and whatever
Ben	PERSON	did in the Orchid station has made them constantly shift through time .
		
		They are in the past .
		
		The group set out to find a man-made landmark on the
Island	LOCATION	to determine where they are in time .
		
		After several more flashes , the team decide to head back to the beach .
		
		At the beach , they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows , resulting in several casualties .
		
		The group ultimately splits up , with
James	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	heading toward the creek together .
		
		There they are attacked by three strangers .
		
		They demand answers , and even threatens to cut off Juliet 's hand to emphasize their impatience , when
Locke	PERSON	arrives to kill one and injure the other two .
		
		James ,
Juliet	PERSON	, and
Locke	PERSON	question the two attackers and
Juliet	PERSON	discover they are Others when they speak Latin to each other .
		
		They arrive at a camp where
Richard Alpert	PERSON	is leading his people and he has
Charlotte	LOCATION	,
Daniel	PERSON	and Miles held captive .
		
		The year is
1954	DATE	.
		
		When an Other called
Ellie	PERSON	takes
Daniel	PERSON	at gunpoint to try to disarm a hydrogen bomb called Jughead ,
James	PERSON	holds a gun at her in order to rescue him .
		
		He then discovers
Daniel	PERSON	had told
Ellie	PERSON	they are from the future and are not part of the American military which the Others had believed they were .
		
		Suddenly , there is yet another flash and the Others including
Ellie	PERSON	and
Richard	PERSON	disappear .
		
		James and the rest see
Charlotte	LOCATION	bleed from her nose and collapse .
		
		James watches as
Juliet	PERSON	and
Daniel	PERSON	attempt to wake up
Charlotte	LOCATION	, who eventually comes around .
		
		James and
Locke	PERSON	decide to head to the Orchid Station , believing a way to stop the jumps is there .
		
		When they return to the beach they discover the camp is back but has been abandoned and they also find a rowing boat on which they decide to use to get to the Orchid .
		
		However whilst rowing they are attacked by unknown assailants from behind -
Juliet	PERSON	manages to shoot one of the attackers but before anything else can happen there is another flash .
		
		The assailants are gone , and they are rowing in the rain .
		
		Later on , the team is reunited with
Jin	PERSON	, last seen in There 's No Place Like Home | the season four finale , who is alive .
		
		Along with Jin the team then continue on to Orchid where the flashes become worse and becomes painful for all the castaways and not just
Charlotte	LOCATION	.
		
		James ,
Juliet	PERSON	and Miles get headaches and bleeding noses but it becomes too much for
Charlotte	LOCATION	who once again falls to the ground .
		
		The shifts are slowly but surely killing them .
		
		
Daniel	PERSON	decides to stay behind with her and the rest continue to the Orchid .
		
		They arrive to find only a well , which evidently leads to the wheel .
		
		Locke will stop the time flashes , and as he lowers himself ,
James	PERSON	and the others bid him good-bye .
		
		Just then , another flash engulfs the
Island	LOCATION	, forcing James to try to grasp
Locke	PERSON	's hand , but to no avail .
		
		Once the flash is passed , the well is not even existent .
		
		In a frenzy ,
James	PERSON	starts digging at the ground , but
Juliet	PERSON	tells him
Locke	PERSON	is gone .
		
		=
Locke	PERSON	then goes into a cave and turns the crank , which Ben originally turned , and the island stops moving through time .
		
		James ,
Juliet	PERSON	, Miles and Jin head back to
Daniel	PERSON	, who informs them
Charlotte	LOCATION	has died due to violent shifts through time .
		
		As they all head back to the beach they hear the sound of gunshots and a woman screaming .
		
		Approaching the source of the commotion they see two men holding a woman hostage with a bag over her head after just killing her male companion .
		
		James and
Juliet	PERSON	aim their guns at the men and tell them to stand down but when one of the men takes a shot at James both he and
Juliet	PERSON	kill the men in self-defense .
		
		James releases the woman , who introduces herself as
Amy	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		She tells them they need to bury the men they killed and to take her husband 's body back to her people in order to keep a truce .
		
		As the team and the woman called Amy trudge back , they approach a sonic fence .
		
		Amy appears to turn off the machine and walk through it without being harmed .
		
		However
James	PERSON	,
Juliet	PERSON	,
Daniel	PERSON	, Miles and
Jin	PERSON	walk through and are all knocked unconscious .
		
		Amy is revealed to be wearing earplugs .
		
		James later wakes up in a house on a couch .
		
		A man named
Horace Goodspeed	PERSON	-LRB-
Doug Hutchison	PERSON	-RRB- demands to know who he and his friends are .
		
		Being a slick con-man , he lies and tells
Horace	PERSON	his name is
Jim LaFleur	PERSON	and he was a captain of a ship which had crashed on the island .
		
		Horace , believing his story , tells him a submarine is departing from the Island the next day and that
James	PERSON	and his friends must be on it .
		
		James asks if he could search for his `` other friends , '' but his plea is denied .
		
		It appears
Horace	PERSON	and
Amy	PERSON	are part of the DHARMA Initiative .
		
		
Later that night	TIME	,
Richard Alpert	PERSON	enters the Barracks , DHARMA 's homes , to demand where his two men , the ones James killed , are buried .
		
		James decides to take control of the situation and he walks up to
Richard	PERSON	alone .
		
		He explains to
Richard	PERSON	he is not from DHARMA and he is friends with
John Locke	PERSON	, who had met
Richard	PERSON	a few years prior during an earlier flash .
		
		He gives the flustered
Richard	PERSON	information able to fully convince the latter .
		
		James also tells
Richard	PERSON	"that he was forced to kill his men in self-defense ;"
Richard	PERSON	"however tells him his people are livid and want some justice ; Amy agrees to give"
Richard	PERSON	the body of
Paul	PERSON	, her husband , in order to keep the truce .
		
		"The agreement is made ;"
Richard	PERSON	leaves .
		
		It appears the present time is
1974	DATE	, at the peak of the DHARMA Initiative 's presence on the
Island	LOCATION	.
		
		Both DHARMA and the Others are in a truce , stating they must respect their own privacy on the
Island	LOCATION	.
		
		A relieved and obliged
Horace	PERSON	kindly informs
James	PERSON	he and his fellow survivors can stay on the
Island	LOCATION	for two more weeks in order to search for his friends -LRB-
Locke	PERSON	-RRB- , before boarding the next submarine off the
Island	LOCATION	.
		
		James and
Juliet	PERSON	share a quiet moment at the dock , the latter telling the former her longing to leave the
Island	LOCATION	is at its peak .
		
		She wants to leave on the next submarine , but
James	PERSON	reminds her she has nothing to go back to , since they are thirty years back .
		
		Juliet consents to staying .
		
		= Three years pass , and
James	PERSON	is still on the
Island	LOCATION	along with his friends .
		
		They are all working for DHARMA , and for the most part they are contented living at the Barracks , especially
James	PERSON	, who shares a home with
Juliet	PERSON	.
		
		He is the head of security and an apparently trustworthy figure , using his alias ``
Jim LaFleur	PERSON	. ''
		
		One morning , he receives a call from Jin regarding the return of
Jack	PERSON	,
Kate	PERSON	, and
Hurley	PERSON	, having returned to the
Island	LOCATION	and to the past .
		
		Stunned , he goes out to meet them at a grassy field far from the Barracks , and there he tells them of his position within DHARMA and the present time of
1977	DATE	.
		
		Kate 's return makes him realize that despite being apart for 3 years and having fallen for
Juliet	PERSON	, he is still in love with
Kate	PERSON	, and becomes torn between her and
Juliet	PERSON	.
		
		Likewise ,
Kate	PERSON	continues to be torn between
Jack and Sawyer	PERSON	, and is jealous upon learning of
Sawyer	PERSON	's relationship with
Juliet	PERSON	.
		
		In order to smuggle them into DHARMA ,
Sawyer	PERSON	instructs the three to dress up in appropriate clothing and pretend to be new recruits for DHARMA so as to avoid awkward questions and the Hostiles , DHARMA 's name of choice for the Others .
		
		Later Sayid , -LRB- last seen in 316 -RRB- , who also traveled back in time , is caught in the jungle and is mistaken by DHARMA as a Hostile .
		
		James is pressured to execute him for violating the code of truce between DHARMA and the
Hostiles	LOCATION	, but he has him locked in a cell and quietly contemplates a plan to free him .
		
		Sayid escapes a few days later with the help of eleven-year-old
Ben	PERSON	.
		
		After the former shoots the latter and runs off ,
Jin	PERSON	carries the boy back to the Barracks , where he is treated with minimal success at the infirmary .
		
		James alerts
Jack	PERSON	and pleads him to help , but his request is snubbed .
		
		Eventually ,
James	PERSON	and
Kate	PERSON	take the unconscious boy to the Others , believing they can provide the only cure .
		
		After doing so , with the caveat
Ben	PERSON	will never be the same again ,
James	PERSON	asks Miles through the surveillance camera at the border between
DHARMA	ORGANIZATION	's area and the Others ' territory to remove the tape containing footage of
Ben	PERSON	being taken away .
		
		The two return to the Barracks afterward .
		
		James is alerted of
Roger Linus	PERSON	's ,
Ben	PERSON	's father , suspicions , and begins to worry about what may come next .
		
		Security staff member
Phil	PERSON	-LRB-
Patrick Fischler	PERSON	#NOM?
James	PERSON	and shows him the tape mentioned earlier , this proving Miles failed
James	PERSON	' order .
		
		James knocks him out in response and keeps him tied up and gagged in the closet .
		
		The next day , he holds a meeting with only the Oceanic Six survivors and
Juliet	PERSON	and reluctantly tells them his comfortable life within DHARMA is ending , thanks to
Jack	PERSON	,
Kate	PERSON	, and
Hurley	PERSON	.
		
		He wants to return the beach and start over .
		
		However , following the events in The Variable ,
Radzinsky	PERSON	, an antagonistic engineer of DHARMA 's , discovers
Phil	PERSON	in the closet and ties up
James	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	in two chairs , furiously demanding answers .
		
		James refuses to comply , forcing
Radzinsky	PERSON	to violently beat him , even with
Horace	PERSON	pleading him not to .
		
		When Dr.
Pierre Chang	PERSON	#NOM?
Island	LOCATION	because of impending danger ,
James	PERSON	requests the women and children get on the submarine and leave .
		
		He also agrees to tell everyone everything on the condition he and
Juliet	PERSON	also get spots on the sub .
		
		"An agreement is made ; they get on board ,"
James	PERSON	hoping never to turn back .
		
		Unfortunately ,
Kate	PERSON	also gets on , informing him and
Juliet	PERSON	of
Jack	PERSON	's intentions to detonate a hydrogen bomb which will decimate the
Island	LOCATION	and alter the past so Oceanic 815 will never crash twenty-seven years from now .
		
		Very reluctantly ,
James	PERSON	agrees to help stop
Jack	PERSON	, and the three secretly leave the sub and head back to the beach .
		
		After briefly meeting up with Rose and
Bernard	PERSON	-LRB- last seen in The Lie -RRB- and leaving them , they confront
Jack	PERSON	,
Hurley	PERSON	,
Sayid	LOCATION	,
Jin	PERSON	, and Miles .
		
		
James drags Jack	PERSON	to a secluded area and tells him that he ,
James	PERSON	, could have stopped
Anthony Cooper	PERSON	from conning his parents and thus preventing their deaths a year ago , but asserts what is done is done , and
Jack	PERSON	should do the same in his case .
		
		When
Jack rebuffs	PERSON	, they get into a fistfight which continued until Juliet intervenes .
		
		Much to
James	PERSON	' vexation ,
Juliet	PERSON	agrees with
Jack	PERSON	.
		
		Juliet tells
James	PERSON	she will never lose him if she does not know him .
		
		As
Jack	PERSON	prepares to go to the constructing Swan Station to drop the bomb on the electromagnetic source ,
Phil	PERSON	and his men spot him and try to shoot him down .

		It is also hard for him to work with other people , a quality essential for surviving on the island , and is quoted saying `` every man for himself '' when he is expected to help
Jack	PERSON	escape from The Others in season three .
		
		However , he grows more mature and caring in the later seasons , mostly because of his love for
Kate	PERSON	, and , later , his own leadership role on the island and his relationship with
Juliet	PERSON	.
		
		He shows his emotional side occasionally in the earlier seasons , too , especially in the flashbacks .
		
		He is very often depicted reading books , a habit that contrasts with his `` redneck '' side .

Josh Holloway	PERSON	forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration .
		
		He managed to remember his lines after this and finished reading the monologue .
		
		The producers knew he did n't suit the role , but thought he was very watchable , so they rewrote the role to suit him , making him more feral ,
Southern	ORGANIZATION	, and kept the same intelligence he originally had .

Jorge Garcia	PERSON	and
Dominic Monaghan	PERSON	read
Sawyer	PERSON	's lines when they came in to audition because there was no existing script for their characters .

		* List of Coronation Street characters -LRB- 2011 -RRB- * List of soap opera villains '' ` Tory Foster '' ' is a fictional character from the
2004	DATE	TV series '' Battlestar Galactica '' , portrayed by
Rekha Sharma	PERSON	.
		
		Tory , like the other members of the Cylon -LRB- reimagining -RRB- #The Final Five -LRB-
Samuel Anders	PERSON	,
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	,
Tory Foster	ORGANIZATION	,
Saul Tigh	PERSON	,
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	-RRB- | Final Five , was originally from a planet called Earth_in_science_fiction #Battlestar_Galactica |
Earth	LOCATION	.
		
		This Earth had been colonized by the
13th Tribe	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- composed of Cylons from the planet Kobol -RRB- roughly 4,000 years before the events of the series -LRB- c. 152,000 BC as revealed by the final episode -RRB- .
		
		Tory and
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	were in a relationship in their past lives - they lived together and planned to get married .
		
		Tory and the other members of the group that would later be known as the Final Five were working to recreate the resurrection process their Cylon ancestors used to employ on Kobol , a process that had fallen out of favor on
Earth	LOCATION	due to procreation .
		
		They had some advance knowledge of the impending destruction due to warnings from people no one else could see .
		
		The messenger that appeared to Tory looked like a man .
		
		When Earth was destroyed roughly 2,000 years ago the Final Five arranged to have themselves resurrected aboard a sub-light ship orbiting earth .
		
		They then left to find the Twelve Colonies and warn them about treating their artificial life with respect or face the same doom that befell Earth .
		
		By the time the Final Five completed their sublight journey thousands of years had passed , and they arrived near the end of the first Cylon/human war .
		
		Meeting the Cylon centurions , the Five offered to show them how to create humanoid cylon models in exchange for the centurions ending the war .
		
		The Final Five created eight models .
		
		However , the first model -LRB-
John Cavil	PERSON	-RRB- destroyed the seventh model -LRB-
Daniel	PERSON	-RRB- out of fraternal envy .
		
		Cavil then killed the Final Five and boxed their minds for years , later resurrecting them in new bodies and reprogramming them to think they were humans from the
Twelve Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Presumably , he also reprogrammed the other Cylon models to not think about the Final Five or investigate their identities , and that to do so would constitute heresy .
		
		In her new life , before the Destruction of the
Twelve Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, Tory was a precinct captain for the
Federalist Party	ORGANIZATION	in
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	on
Caprica	LOCATION	for five years .
		
		In this capacity , she became an expert on polling .
		
		During the nuclear attack on the Colonies she was driving down a road on
Caprica	LOCATION	and got hit by the force of a nuclear shockwave .
		
		Her car was destroyed and she was injured , but she managed to survive the shockwave and was presumably picked up by a Raptor that landed nearby looking for survivors .
		
		Following the death of
Billy Keikeya	PERSON	,
Tory Foster	ORGANIZATION	becomes one of President
Laura Roslin	PERSON	's chief aides and advisors .
		
		She takes a particular responsibility for managing
Roslin	ORGANIZATION	's election campaign .
		
		One of her first moves is to take an opinion poll , the results of which clearly show Roslin leading her presumptive opponent ,
Tom Zarek	PERSON	.
		
		She plays a part in finding a human foster mother for the half-Cylon child
Hera Agathon	PERSON	and is one of the few people who know the child is alive .
		
		She counsels
Roslin	ORGANIZATION	during the
Rya Kibby	PERSON	case , as she weighs up the consequences of appeasing the pro-life beliefs of the Gemenese and the need to repopulate the human race versus the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed under Colonial law before the attack .
		
		After
Roslin	PERSON	's executive order criminalizes abortion throughout the fleet , Vice-President
Gaius Baltar	PERSON	announces his candidacy in the forthcoming election , and garners
Zarek	ORGANIZATION	's support as campaign manager -LRB- and eventual Vice-President During the occupation of
New Caprica	LOCATION	by the Cylons , Foster joins the human resistance movement , again serving as
Laura Roslin	ORGANIZATION	's aide .
		
		She works to compile a list of known Cylon collaborators among the human population .
		
		Following
Roslin	PERSON	's second inauguration as President of the Twelve Colonies , Foster resumes her former duties as a presidential aide .
		
		In the last few episodes of season 3 , her mental condition starts deteriorating , and she starts hearing music .
		
		In the cliffhanger Season 3 finale , `` Crossroads , Part II '' , she , along with
Samuel Anders	PERSON	,
Saul Tigh	PERSON	, and
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	become aware of the fact they are Cylons , based on hallucinatory music -LRB- which turns out to be `` All Along The Watchtower , '' as performed by Bear
McCreary	PERSON	| Bear
McCreary	PERSON	's brother -RRB- only they can hear , and a `` switch '' that goes off within them -LRB- as Chief Tyrol mentions -RRB- .
		
		Foster and
Anders	PERSON	have experienced at least the beginnings of a physical relationship .
		
		As the Cylon fleet attacked , Tigh defiantly declared `` Whatever else I am , I 'm an officer in the
Colonial Fleet	ORGANIZATION	and if I die today , that 's the man I 'll be . ''
		
		Following this speech , Foster reported to the
CIC	ORGANIZATION	to aid President
Roslin	PERSON	.
		
		Season 4 opens with
Tory Foster	ORGANIZATION	continuing her participation in clandestine final-four Cylon meetings -LRB-
Anders	ORGANIZATION	, Foster ,
Tigh	ORGANIZATION	,
Tyrol	LOCATION	-RRB- .
		
		Tigh suggests
Gaius Baltar	PERSON	as a potential source of information , citing
Baltar	PERSON	"'s previous time spent among the Cylons ; Foster attempts to gain"
Gaius	PERSON	' confidence via professed admiration and seduction .
		
		Despite her initial objection to actual sexual relations , she has sex with
Baltar	PERSON	during which she weeps .
		
		When
Baltar	PERSON	asks why she is crying , she says it 's just something she does , and things could be worse : she could be a Cylon .
		
		Baltar tells her he believes Cylons can feel , and , touched , she stops crying and kisses him in
earnest	LOCATION	.
		
		Subsequently , she seems to be spending more and more time with
Baltar	PERSON	, not necessarily just to gain information .
		
		In `` Escape Velocity , '' she attends one of
Baltar	PERSON	's monotheism rallies , and appears to be approving .
		
		When she
discovers Cally Tyrol	ORGANIZATION	has overheard one of the clandestine meetings , she follows her to a Viper launch tube , dissuades Cally from killing herself and her son , and secures the infant , but Foster then ejects the mother out the tube herself .
		
		Foster shows no guilt .
		
		She appears to have embraced both being a Cylon and her own version of
Baltar	PERSON	's teachings , allowing her to by-pass such feelings and adopt an almost hedonistic approach to life .
		
		She declares herself to be `` perfect '' , something that disturbs fellow Cylons Tigh and
Tyrol	LOCATION	, and is in marked contrast to
Tigh	ORGANIZATION	's and
Caprica	LOCATION	Six 's guilty consciences -LRB- Escape Velocity -RRB- .
		
		Later ,
Foster	ORGANIZATION	meets with President
Roslin	PERSON	, who first pleasantly comments about Foster 's positive change in mood any time she is aboard
Galactica	LOCATION	.
		
		Roslin asks Foster to find out who was sharing the rumors of the president 's shared visions to
Baltar	PERSON	, then sticks the dagger in , telling Foster she is very aware that she is sleeping with
Gaius Baltar	PERSON	.
		
		Before Foster can say a word ,
Roslin	ORGANIZATION	tells her there are enough reports of her visitations to `` make her a charter member of his nymph squad . ''
		
		Foster confesses to believing in
Baltar	LOCATION	's spiritual message , but
Roslin	LOCATION	is feeling quite betrayed and turns her back on her to do other work , ordering her away -LRB- Guess What 's Coming to Dinner ? -RRB-
		
		.
		
		Out of the known members of the Final Five , Tory seems to be embracing her Cylon-self more than the others .
		
		The other three are attempting to maintain their human selves -LRB- the same way that Boomer did -RRB- .
		
		This results in a change to her personality .
		
		After Downloaded Three is unboxed , now knowing the identities of the Final Five , and brought to
Galactica	LOCATION	, Foster stays true her earlier affinity for her Cylon side .
		
		Under the pretence of bringing
Laura Roslin	PERSON	her medication , she flies to the Cylon basestar , where she is introduced to her fellow Cylons and tells
Roslin	PERSON	and
Baltar	PERSON	about her true nature .
		
		During the ensuing stand off between Three and
Galactica	LOCATION	over the remaining three Cylons , she helps Three 's cause by informing her of
Lee Adama	LOCATION	's perceived weaknesses -LRB- Revelations -RRB- .
		
		When the fleet arrives at
Earth	LOCATION	and discovers it is a barren world destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe and once populated by Cylons , Foster and her fellow Final Five Cylons begin remembering details about their past lives on the planet .
		
		One detail she clearly remembers is how Anders used to be a musician and used to play a song he wrote for her and their friends ,
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	and
Saul	PERSON	and
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	.
		
		She and
Tyrol	LOCATION	were also lovers at the time -LRB- No Exit -RRB- .
		
		Since being publicly identified as a member of the
Final Five Cylons , Foster	ORGANIZATION	has taken up full-time residence on board the rebel basestar , living with the Twos , Sixes -LRB- less Caprica-Six -RRB- , and Eights -LRB- less
Sharon Agathon & Sharon Valerii	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .
		
		Her fellow Cylons appear to have also given her equal status in their command hierarchy , as evident by her behaviour during
Gaeta	PERSON	's Mutiny .
		
		When
Laura Roslin	PERSON	is smuggled aboard the basestar , Foster is content to abandon the fleet to its own turmoil and simply jump away to safety , a notion her fellow Cylons support .
		
		Though she repeatedly argues against involving the basestar in the counter-coup efforts , she ultimately concedes to
Roslin	ORGANIZATION	's plan -LRB- Blood on the Scales -RRB- .
		
		During
Gaeta	PERSON	's mutiny
Sam Anders	PERSON	is shot in the back of the skull .
		
		When he regains consciousness he remembers his and the others former life on
Earth	LOCATION	and after .
		
		He recites the history as fast as he could to the other Final Five , including Tory Foster .
		
		Like the other Fives , she was a scientist attempting to reinvent resurrection technology .
		
		To her and
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	's mutual shock she learned they were once lived together as lovers and were engaged to be married .
		
		-LRB- No Exit -RRB- After Anders 's apparently unsuccessful -LRB- in that he never regained consciousness -RRB- surgery and his comatose state , Foster urges the other Finals and
Caprica	LOCATION	Six to leave for the Baseship and abandon the fleet in order to strike out on their own without humanity .
		
		Then
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	, the
Fifth Final	ORGANIZATION	, arrives after apparently being rescued from
Cavil	PERSON	by
Sharon	ORGANIZATION	`` Boomer ''
Valerii	PERSON	.
		
		The Final Five debate the merits of staying with the fleet versus leaving .
		
		When the matter is put to a vote ,
Tyrol	ORGANIZATION	and Foster vote to leave and Tigh votes to stay .
		
		Though Anders is in a coma during this debate ,
Tyrol	ORGANIZATION	reminds the others
Anders	PERSON	had previously pleaded with
Colonel Tigh	ORGANIZATION	to stay with the fleet , and they agree to count
Anders	PERSON	's vote thusly .
		
		This means the vote is a 2-2 deadlock with
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	holding the deciding vote .
		
		Ellen is conflicted and postpones her decision , as she is upset by her discovery of the relationship between
Saul Tigh	PERSON	and
Caprica	LOCATION	Six .
		
		Later , driven by jealousy , resentment and anger over
Saul Tigh	PERSON	conceiving a child with
Caprica	LOCATION	Six and the implication he loved
Caprica	LOCATION	Six more than he ever did
Ellen	PERSON	,
Ellen	PERSON	makes her decision and votes with Foster and
Tyrol	LOCATION	to leave humanity .
		
		However Caprica Six 's miscarriage , possibly brought on by stress caused by an attack in
Dogsville	LOCATION	and personal confrontations with
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	over the true love of
Saul Tigh	PERSON	, changes the situation .
		
		Foster and the others reluctantly decide to stay , since the loss of
Caprica	LOCATION	Six 's pregnancy means
Hera Agathon	LOCATION	has become the only remaining hope of Cylon continuity -LRB- Deadlock -RRB- .
		
		As the Five recover from the tragedy of the miscarriage , Tory commiserates with the others , including a Tyrol desperate to save the life of Boomer , who was about to be transported for trial on the Baseship .
		
		She agrees with
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	they can not interfere with Cylon due process other than being witnesses .
		
		At
Joe	PERSON	's Bar ,
Tory	ORGANIZATION	hears
Kara Thrace	PERSON	playing the piano and recognizes the tune as the song switching on the Final Four in the nebula .
		
		She confronts
Thrace	LOCATION	to find out where she learned that song .
		
		Thrace informs her it was a song her father played for her as a child .
		
		Later off-screen she told them she was playing the music notes written as a drawing by
Hera Agathon	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		By this time ,
Sharon Valerii	PERSON	had already abducted
Hera	LOCATION	and escaped back to
Cavil	PERSON	's Baseship -LRB- Someone to Watch Over Me -RRB- .
		
		Tory continues to congregate with the Final Five , who are by now a close-knit group watching over their comatose member -LRB- Anders -RRB- .
		
		However , the group temporarily loses
Tyrol	LOCATION	as he is imprisoned for his role in unwittingly allowing Valerii to kidnap
Hera	LOCATION	and escape .
		
		
Ellen Tigh	PERSON	urges the Adamas to search for
Hera	LOCATION	on the Cylon Homeworld , and is emphatically supported by
Anders	PERSON	's wife
Kara Thrace	PERSON	.
		
		Tory abstains from voicing her own opinion on the matter , but she agrees with
Ellen	PERSON	's recommendation and helps arrange the
Heavy Raider	ORGANIZATION	reconnaissance mission after Adama gives his permission -LRB- Islanded in a Stream of Stars -RRB- .
		
		Tory reluctantly volunteers for the mission to rescue
Hera	LOCATION	, partially due to the insistence of
Galen Tyrol	PERSON	.
		
		She assists
Ellen	PERSON	in maintaining the link between Anders and ''
Galactica	LOCATION	'' during the battle .
		
		After agreeing to share resurrection technology with the Cylons in exchange for a truce , Tory becomes nervous the sharing process will involve a pooling of her memories with the rest of the Five , which will reveal the truth about the murder of Cally .
		
		Tory therefore asks the others to pledge that no matter what they find out about each other , they will forgive each other for it .
		
		Tigh agrees and the Five start the process , but when
Tyrol	ORGANIZATION	sees her memory of murdering Cally he flies into a rage , breaks the download to strangle Tory , and ultimately snaps her neck in retribution .

		* Frankenstein in popular culture '' ` Frankenstein 's monster '' ' , sometimes known as '' ` Frankenstein '' ' , is a fictional character who first appeared in
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's
1818	DATE	"novel '' Frankenstein | Frankenstein ; or , The Modern Prometheus '' ."
		
		Shelley 's title thus compares the monster 's creator ,
Victor Frankenstein	PERSON	, to the mythological character Prometheus , who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire .
		
		Although nameless in
Shelley	LOCATION	's novel , the creature is often referred to by his creator 's surname , `` Frankenstein '' .
		
		In
Shelley	PERSON	's Gothic story ,
Victor Frankenstein	PERSON	builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguous method consisting of chemistry and alchemy .
		
		Shelley describes the monster as , hideously ugly , but sensitive and emotional .
		
		The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned , which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein .
		
		According to the scholar
Joseph Carroll	PERSON	, the monster occupies `` a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists '' .
		
		Caroll ,
Joseph	PERSON	et al. . ''
		
		Graphing
Jane Austen	PERSON	: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning '' , -LRB-
Palgrave Macmillan	PERSON	, 2012 -RRB- .
		
		as the monster in an
1823	DATE	stage production of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's novel
Mary Shelley	PERSON	"'s original novel never ascribes an actual name to the monster ; although when speaking to his creator ,"
Victor Frankenstein	PERSON	, the monster does call himself the `` Adam of your labours '' -LRB- in reference to the first man created in the
Bible	LOCATION	-RRB- .
		
		Victor refers to the monster as `` creature '' , `` fiend '' , `` spectre '' , `` the demon '' , `` wretch '' , `` devil '' , `` thing '' , `` being '' , and `` ogre '' .
		
		It has become common vernacular to refer to the creature by the name `` Frankenstein '' , though this never actually happens in the book .
		
		As in
Shelley	LOCATION	's story , the monster 's namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	during the decades after the novel 's first appearance .
		
		In
1823	DATE	,
Shelley	PERSON	herself attended a performance of '' Presumption '' , the first successful stage adaptation of her novel .
		
		`` The play bill amused me extremely , for in the list of dramatis personae came _________ , by
Mr T. Cooke	PERSON	, '' she wrote to her friend
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.
		
		`` This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good . ''
		
		Within a decade of publication , the name of the creator-Frankenstein-was used to refer to the monster , but it did not become firmly established until much later .
		
		The story was adapted for the stage in
1927	DATE	by
Peggy Webling	PERSON	, Modern practice varies somewhat .
		
		For example , in '' Dean
Koontz	PERSON	's Frankenstein '' , first published in
2004	DATE	, the creature is named `` Deucalion '' , after the character from Greek Mythology , who is the son of the titan Prometheus , a reference to the original novel 's title .
		
		Another example is the second episode of
Showtime	ORGANIZATION	's '' Penny Dreadful '' , which first aired in
2014	DATE	";"
Victor Frankenstein	PERSON	briefly considers naming his creation `` Adam '' , before deciding instead to let the monster `` pick his own name '' .
		
		Thumbing through a book of the works of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, the monster chooses `` Proteus '' from '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	'' .
		
		It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the '' second '' monster Frankenstein has created , with the first , abandoned creation having been named `` Caliban '' , from '' The Tempest '' , by the theatre actor who took him in and later , after leaving the theatre , named himself after the English poet
John Clare	PERSON	.

		The creature eventually introduces himself to the family 's blind father , who treats him with kindness .
		
		When the rest of the family returns , however , they are frightened of him and drive him away .
		
		Hopeful but bewildered , the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her .
		
		He finds Frankenstein 's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory , and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him .
		
		The monster kills
Victor	PERSON	's younger brother
William	PERSON	upon learning of the boy 's relation to his hated creator .
		
		When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains , the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate .
		
		"In return , he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again ; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail ."
		
		Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature , but , aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters , destroys his experiment .
		
		In response , the monster kills
Frankenstein	ORGANIZATION	's best friend
Henry Clerval	PERSON	, and later kills
Frankenstein	ORGANIZATION	's bride
Elizabeth Lavenza	PERSON	"on their wedding night ; whereupon"

Boris Karloff	PERSON	-RRB- .
		
		jpg | thumb | left |
Boris Karloff	PERSON	as the classic
1930s	DATE	film version with an assist from makeup artist
Jack Pierce Shelley	PERSON	"described Frankenstein 's monster as an , hideously ugly creation , with translucent yellowish skin pulled so taut over the body that it `` barely disguised the workings of the arteries and muscles underneath '' ; watery , glowing eyes , flowing black hair , black lips , and prominent white teeth ."
		
		The monster attempts to integrate himself into human society , but is shunned by all who see him .
		
		This compels him to seek revenge against his creator .
		
		A picture of the creature appeared in the
1831	DATE	edition .
		
		Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga , shaded , along with the monster 's skin , a pale blue .
		
		Throughout the
19th century	DATE	, the monster 's image remained variable according to the artist .
		
		The best-known image of
Frankenstein	ORGANIZATION	's monster in popular culture derives from
Boris Karloff	PERSON	's portrayal in the
1931	DATE	movie '' Frankenstein , '' in which he wore makeup applied , and according to a format designed by ,
Jack P. Pierce	PERSON	and possibly suggested by director
James Whale	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Universal Studios , which released the film , was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format .
		
		"Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films , '' Bride of Frankenstein '' and '' Son of Frankenstein '' ;"
Lon Chaney	PERSON	, Jr. took over the part from
Karloff	PERSON	"in '' The Ghost of Frankenstein ; ''"
Bela Lugosi	PERSON	"portrayed the role in '' Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man ; '' and"
Glenn Strange	PERSON	played the monster in the last three
Universal Studios	ORGANIZATION	films to feature the character - '' House of Frankenstein , '' '' House of Dracula , '' and ''
Abbott	PERSON	and Costello Meet Frankenstein . ''
		
		But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by
Karloff	PERSON	.
		
		To this day , the image of
Karloff	PERSON	's face is owned by his daughter 's company ,
Karloff Enterprises	ORGANIZATION	, for which
Universal	ORGANIZATION	replaced
Karloff	PERSON	's features with
Glenn Strange	PERSON	's in most of their marketing .
		
		Since
Karloff	PERSON	's portrayal , the creature almost always appears as a towering , undead-like figure , often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes .
		
		He wears a dark , usually tattered , suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick , heavy boots , causing him to walk with an awkward , stiff-legged gait -LRB- as opposed to the novel , in which he is described as much more flexible than a human -RRB- .
		
		The tone of his skin varies -LRB- although shades of green or gray are common -RRB- , and his body appears stitched together at certain parts -LRB- such as around the neck and joints -RRB- .
		
		This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters , such as the Hulk .
		
		In the
1973	DATE	TV mini-series '' Frankenstein : The True Story , '' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster :
Michael Sarrazin	PERSON	appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process .
		
		In the
1994	DATE	film '' Frankenstein -LRB-
1994	DATE	film -RRB- |
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's Frankenstein , '' the creature is played by
Robert De Niro	PERSON	in a nearer approach to the original source , except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches .
		
		He is , as in the novel , motivated by pain and loneliness .
		
		In this version ,
Frankenstein	ORGANIZATION	gives the monster the brain of his mentor ,
Doctor Waldman	PERSON	, while his body is made from a man who killed
Waldman	PERSON	while resisting a vaccination .
		
		The monster retains
Waldman	PERSON	's `` trace memories '' that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read .
		
		In the
2004	DATE	film '' Van Helsing , '' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design .
		
		He is tall , has a square bald head , gruesome scars , and pale green skin .
		
		The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart .
		
		It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs , essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg .
		
		Although not as eloquent as in the novel , this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent .
		
		In
2004	DATE	, a TV mini-series adaptation of '' Frankenstein '' was made by Hallmark .
		
		
Luke Goss	PERSON	plays The Creature .
		
		This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel : intelligent and articulate , with flowing , dark hair and watery eyes .
		
		The 2014 TV series '' Penny Dreadful '' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's description .
		
		This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by
Shelley	PERSON	, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face .
		
		In this series , the monster names himself `` Caliban '' , after the character in
William Shakespeare	PERSON	's '' The Tempest '' .
		
		In the series ,
Victor Frankenstein	PERSON	makes a second and third creature , each more indistinguishable from normal human beings .
		
		as
Frankenstein	ORGANIZATION	's monster with
Boris Karloff	PERSON	, this time playing another character , in the
1944	DATE	film '' House of Frankenstein '' As depicted by
Shelley	PERSON	, the monster is a sensitive , emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself .
		
		The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in '' Paradise Lost '' , ''
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's Lives '' , and '' The Sorrows of Young Werther '' .
		
		From the beginning , the monster is rejected by everyone he meets .
		
		"He realizes from the moment of his `` birth '' that even his own creator can not stand being around him ; this is obvious when"
Frankenstein	PERSON	says '' ... one hand was stretched out , seemingly to detain me , but I escaped ... '' .
		
		Upon seeing his own reflection , he realizes that he too can not stand to see himself .
		
		"His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance ; but when that desire is denied , he swears revenge on his creator ."
		
		Contrary to many film versions , the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking .
		
		"Almost immediately after his creation , he dresses himself ; and within 11 months , he can speak and read German and French ."
		
		By the end of the novel , the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well .
		
		The '' Van Helsing '' and '' Penny Dreadful '' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original , although the latter version is the only one to retain the character 's violent reactions to rejection .
		
		In the
1931	DATE	"film adaptation , the monster is depicted as mute and bestial ; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal 's `` abnormal '' brain ."
		
		In the subsequent sequel , '' Bride of Frankenstein '' , the monster learns to speak , albeit in short , stunted sentences .
		
		In the second sequel , '' Son of Frankenstein '' , the creature is again rendered inarticulate .
		
		Following a brain transplant in the third sequel , '' The Ghost of Frankenstein '' , the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor .
		
		This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel , '' Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man '' , but the dialogue was excised before release .
		
		The monster was effectively mute in later sequels , though he is heard to refer to Count Dracula as his `` master '' in ''
Abbott	PERSON	and Costello Meet Frankenstein '' .
		
		The monster is often portrayed as being afraid of fire .
		
		of
Turin	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	.
		
		Scholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in
Shelley	LOCATION	"'s story , and have analogized the monster to a motherless child ;"
Shelley	PERSON	's own mother died while giving birth to her.Milner ,
Andrew	PERSON	. ''
		
		Literature , Culture and Society , '' -LRB- Psychology Press ,
2005	DATE	-RRB- .
		
		"The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class ;"
Shelley	PERSON	wrote that the monster recognized `` the division of property , of immense wealth and squalid poverty . ''
		
		Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled technology.Coghill ,

		Another proposal is that the character of Dr.
Frankenstein	PERSON	was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name , and who had been called a modern Prometheus --
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	.
		
		Accordingly , the monster would represent the new nation that

Elizabeth Gaffney	PERSON	visited Fish in Sing Sing , accompanied by
Detective King	ORGANIZATION	and two other men .
		
		She wanted to ask him about her son 's death , but Fish refused to speak to her .
		
		Fish began to weep and asked to be left alone .
		
		After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer ,
James Dempsey	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaffney	PERSON	gave up .
		
		She was still unconvinced that
Albert Fish	PERSON	was her son 's killer .
		
		Albert Fish 's trial for the murder of
Grace Budd	ORGANIZATION	began on
March 11 , 1935	DATE	, in
White Plains	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.
		
		
Frederick P. Close	PERSON	presided as judge and
Westchester County	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	| Westchester County Chief Assistant District Attorney
Elbert F. Gallagher	PERSON	was prosecuting attorney .
		
		Fish 's defense counsel was
James Dempsey	PERSON	, a former prosecutor and the one-time mayor of
Peekskill	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.
		
		The trial lasted for 10 days .
		
		Fish pleaded insanity , and claimed to have heard voices from God telling him to kill children .
		
		Several psychiatrists testified about Fish 's sexual fetishes , which included sadism , masochism , cunnilingus , anilingus , fellatio , flagellation , exhibitionism , voyeurism , piquerism , cannibalism , coprophagia , urophilia , pedophilia and infibulation .
		
		Dempsey in his summation noted that Fish was a `` psychiatric phenomenon '' and that nowhere in legal or medical records was there another individual who possessed so many sexual abnormalities .
		
		The defense 's chief expert witness was
Fredric Wertham	PERSON	, a psychiatrist with an emphasis on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the
New York	LOCATION	criminal courts .
		
		During two days of testimony ,
Wertham	PERSON	explained Fish 's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and
Isaac	PERSON	-LRB- Genesis 22:1 -24 -RRB- .
		
		
Wertham	PERSON	said that Fish believed that similarly `` sacrificing '' a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong , angels would prevent it if God did not approve .
		
		Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past .
		
		
Edward Budd	PERSON	was the next intended victim , but he turned out to be larger than expected so he settled on
Grace	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Although he knew
Grace	ORGANIZATION	was female , it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy .
		
		Wertham then detailed Fish 's cannibalism , which in his mind he associated with communion .
		
		The last question
Dempsey	PERSON	asked
Wertham	PERSON	was 15,000 words long , detailed Fish 's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life .
		
		Wertham simply answered `` He is insane '' .
		
		Gallagher cross-examined
Wertham	PERSON	on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong .
		
		He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin , atonement and religion and thus was an `` insane knowledge '' .
		
		The defense called two more psychiatrists to support
Wertham	PERSON	's findings .
		
		The first of four rebuttal witnesses was
Menas Gregory	PERSON	, the former manager of the
Bellevue	LOCATION	psychiatric hospital , where Fish was treated during
1930	DATE	.
		
		He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane .
		
		Under cross examination ,
Dempsey	PERSON	asked if coprophilia , urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person .
		
		Gregory replied that such a person was not `` mentally sick '' and that these were common perversions that were `` socially perfectly alright '' and that Fish was `` no different from millions of other people '' , some very prominent and successful , who suffered from the `` very same '' perversions .
		
		The next witness was the resident physician at
The Tombs	ORGANIZATION	,
Perry Lichtenstein	PERSON	.
		
		Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying on the issue of sanity , but
Justice Close	ORGANIZATION	overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor .
		
		When asked whether Fish 's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition ,
Lichtenstein	PERSON	replied , `` That is not masochism '' , as he was only `` punishing himself to get sexual gratification '' .
		
		The next witness ,
Charles Lambert	PERSON	, testified that coprophilia was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but `` was a matter of taste '' and not evidence of a psychosis .
		
		The last witness ,
James Vavasour	PERSON	, repeated
Lambert	PERSON	's opinion .
		
		Another defense witness was
Mary Nicholas	PERSON	, Fish 's 17-year-old stepdaughter .
		
		She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation .
		
		None of the jurors doubted that Fish was insane , but ultimately , as one later explained , they felt he should be executed anyway .
		
		He was buried in the Sing Sing Prison Cemetery .
		
		Fish is said to have helped the executioner position the electrodes on his body .
		
		His last words were reportedly , `` I do n't even know why I 'm here . ''
		
		According to one witness present , it took two jolts before Fish died , creating the rumor that the apparatus was short-circuited by the needles that Fish inserted into his body .
		
		These rumors were later regarded as untrue , as Fish reportedly died in the same fashion and time frame as others in the electric chair .
		
		At a meeting with reporters after the execution , Fish 's lawyer
James Dempsey	PERSON	revealed that he was in possession of his client 's `` final statement '' .
		
		This amounted to several pages of hand-written notes that Fish apparently penned in the hours just prior to his death .
		
		When pressed by the assembled journalists to reveal the document 's contents ,
Dempsey	PERSON	refused , stating , `` I will never show it to anyone .
		
		It was the most filthy string of obscenities that I have ever read . ''

Whitey Bulger	PERSON	.
		
		Beginning in
1975	DATE	,
Flemmi	PERSON	was a top echelon informant for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- FBI -RRB- .
		
		Despite delivering a great deal of intelligence about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family ,
Flemmi	PERSON	's own criminal activities proved a public relations nightmare for the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		For this reason , he was prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB- and sentenced to a long term of incarceration .
		
		
Stephen Joseph Flemmi	PERSON	was the eldest of three sons born to Italian immigrant Giovanni and Irish immigrant
Mary Irene Flemmi	PERSON	.
		
		He was raised in the Orchard Park tenement located at 25
Ambrose Street	ORGANIZATION	in
Roxbury	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	|
Roxbury	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.
		
		His father was a bricklayer and veteran of the
Royal Italian Army	ORGANIZATION	during World War I , and his mother was a full-time homemaker .
		
		Flemmi enlisted in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	in
1951	DATE	at the age of 17 and served two tours of duty in
Korea	LOCATION	with the
187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		-LRB- right -RRB- , probably in the
1980s	DATE	In
1967	DATE	,
James J.	PERSON	`` Whitey ''
Bulger	PERSON	was released from
Federal	ORGANIZATION	prison after serving a nine-year sentence for robbing banks .
		
		After a few years of working as a janitor , he became an enforcer for
South Boston	LOCATION	mob boss
Donald Killeen	PERSON	.
		
		After
Killeen	PERSON	was murdered by an enforcer for the
Mullen Gang	PERSON	,
Winter Hill Gang	ORGANIZATION	boss
Howie Winter	PERSON	mediated the dispute between
Bulger	PERSON	and the remaining
Killeens	PERSON	and the
Mullens	PERSON	, who were led by
Patrick Nee	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Winter soon chose
Bulger	PERSON	as his man in
South Boston	LOCATION	.
		
		Shortly afterward ,
Bulger	PERSON	became partners with
Flemmi	PERSON	.
		
		At this time , the
Boston FBI	ORGANIZATION	office tried to convince
Bulger	PERSON	to become an informant , but he refused .
		
		Bulger allegedly told
Flemmi	PERSON	that he knew his secret .
		
		Flemmi has insisted that he did not know at the time that
Bulger	PERSON	was also an informant .
		
		
Kevin Weeks	PERSON	, however , insists that
Flemmi	PERSON	's story is untrue .
		
		He considers it too much of a coincidence that
Bulger	PERSON	became an informant a year after becoming
Flemmi	ORGANIZATION	's partner .
		
		He has written off his belief that
Flemmi	PERSON	had probably helped to build a Federal case against him .
		
		Weeks has said that
Bulger	PERSON	was likely forced to choose between supplying information to the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	or returning to prison .
		
		In the
1950s	DATE	,
Flemmi	PERSON	was married to an Irish-American woman named
Jeanette	PERSON	, from whom he later became estranged .
		
		By
1980	DATE	, he planned to divorce
Jeanette	PERSON	to marry his longtime mistress ,
Marilyn DeSilva	PERSON	, but it is unknown whether he ever followed through with the legal actions .
		
		Throughout his life ,
Flemmi	PERSON	was engaged in clandestine affairs with several other women , including sisters
Debra Davis	PERSON	and
Michelle Davis	PERSON	, and
Deborah Hussey	PERSON	.
		
		Flemmi met
Debra Davis	PERSON	at a jewelry store , and the couple dated for more than seven years .
		
		In
1981	DATE	,
Bulger	PERSON	is said to have killed
Davis	PERSON	because she knew that
Flemmi	PERSON	was an informant .
		
		It is thought that
Flemmi	PERSON	,
Bulger	PERSON	, and Weeks lured her to the house at 799 East Third Street in
South Boston	LOCATION	and garrotted her .
		
		Her body was then buried in the basement .
		
		According to
Kevin Weeks	PERSON	, Rico first recruited Flemmi as an informant in
1965	DATE	.
		
		In
1997	DATE	, shortly after '' The
Boston Globe	ORGANIZATION	'' disclosed that
Bulger	PERSON	and
Flemmi	PERSON	had been informants , former
Bulger	PERSON	confidant
Kevin Weeks	PERSON	met with
Connolly	PERSON	, who showed him a photocopy of
Bulger	PERSON	's
FBI	ORGANIZATION	informant file .
		
		In order to explain
Bulger	PERSON	and
Flemmi	PERSON	's status as informants ,
Connolly	PERSON	said , `` The Mafia was going against
Jimmy	PERSON	and Stevie , so Jimmy and
Stevie	PERSON	went against them . ''
		
		In
December 1994	DATE	,
Connolly	ORGANIZATION	informed
Bulger	PERSON	and Flemmi that several imprisoned Jewish-American bookmakers had agreed to testify to paying them protection money .
		
		As a result , sealed indictments had come from the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	and the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	was due to make arrests during the Christmas season .
		
		In response ,
Bulger	PERSON	fled
Boston	LOCATION	on
December 23 , 1994	DATE	, accompanied by his common law wife ,
Catherine Greig	PERSON	.
		
		According to
Kevin Weeks	PERSON	,
Flemmi	LOCATION	, however , chose to remain in
Boston	LOCATION	and was swiftly taken into custody and incarcerated at the
Plymouth County	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts | Plymouth County House of Correction	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		During the discovery phase , two of
Flemmi	PERSON	's co-defendants ,
Boston	LOCATION	mafiosi
Frank Salemme	PERSON	and
Bobby DeLuca	PERSON	, were listening to tape from a roving bug , which is normally authorized when the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place .
		
		They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention that they should have told one of their informants to give `` a list of questions '' to the other wiseguys .
		
		When their lawyer ,
Tony Cardinale	PERSON	, learned about this , he realized that the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	had lied about the basis for a roving bug in order to protect an informant .
		
		Suspecting that this was not the only occasion that this happened ,
Cardinale	PERSON	sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case .
		
		Eventually , both
Bulger	PERSON	and
Flemmi	PERSON	were revealed to be
FBI	ORGANIZATION	informants .
		
		Flemmi believed that as a result , he had protection from the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	, but not immunity .
		
		He initially planned to prove through his own testimony and that of others that he was being prosecuted for crimes that were effectively authorized by the
FBI	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		He believed that as a result , Judge
Mark L. Wolf	PERSON	would have no choice but to throw out the entire indictment .
		
		However , by
2000	DATE	, it was obvious this gambit had failed .
		
		Out of desperation , he ordered Weeks to get in touch with retired state police lieutenant
Richard J. Schneiderhan	PERSON	, a lifelong friend who had been on
Winter Hill	ORGANIZATION	's payroll for virtually his entire career , to leak information about several wiretaps investigators were monitoring in hopes of tracking down
Bulger	PERSON	.
		
		However , when Weeks reached a plea bargain a year later , he admitted
Schneiderhan	PERSON	's role in the leak .
		
		
Schneiderhan	PERSON	was ultimately convicted of obstructing justice and was sentenced to 18 months in prison .
		
		In
2000	DATE	,
Flemmi	PERSON	's brother
Michael	PERSON	, then a retired
Boston Police	ORGANIZATION	officer , was arrested for moving an arsenal of more than 70 weapons from their mother 's shed after learning that it was to be the target of a search warrant .
		
		He was convicted in
2002	DATE	and sentenced to 10 years in prison .
		
		A year later , he pleaded guilty to selling a load of
Stephen	PERSON	's stolen jewelry for
$ 40,000	MONEY	.
		
		By
2003	DATE	,
Flemmi	PERSON	knew he was at the end of his tether .
		
		Salemme , Weeks and several others had turned informer , and had disclosed enough information to send Flemmi to prison for life , and possibly send him to death .
		
		In
October	DATE	,
Flemmi	ORGANIZATION	pleaded guilty in
U.S. District Court	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	to 10 counts of murder .
		
		He made the decision as a part of a deal to reduce the sentence for his brother ,
Michael Flemmi	PERSON	.

		Two mailbombs of wave number five detonated early in mailboxes , the remaining two were discovered and neutralized .
		
		This was the last incident before
Fuchs	PERSON	was arrested .
		
		At this stage
Fuchs	PERSON	had obviously become highly paranoid .
		
		On 1
October 1997	DATE	near his residence in
Gralla	LOCATION	, he followed two women in a car who he believed were observing him .
		
		When police attempted to question him on what they believed was a routine case of stalking , he produced another IED which he had kept in his car , and detonated it in his hands in front of the policemen .
		
		His suicide attempt failed , but he lost both hands , and also injured a nearby police officer .
		
		Fuchs was arrested without giving further resistance and , after a trial which many in

		The prison physician determined it to be a suicide .
		
		Although the case was officially closed after
Fuchs	PERSON	had been sentenced , and although the `` Bajuvarian Liberation Army '' was determined to never have existed as a terrorist organization in the meaning of the term , doubts remained whether
Fuchs	PERSON	had actually committed his actions without any support or tacit knowledge from sympathizers .
		
		A thorough search of the two rooms in his parents ' house where
Fuchs	PERSON	had lived revealed more IEDs but no traces of the equipment which he would have needed to produce and handle the unstable explosives -LRB- including mercury fulminate and nitroglycerol -RRB- contained in his IEDs .
		
		Most of
Fuchs	PERSON	' `` confession letters '' exhibited an aptitude at verbal expression for which he was not known .
		
		Some had referred to internal affairs in police procedures that were not accessible to the general public .
		
		Even more doubts remain concerning
Fuchs	PERSON	' death .
		
		How exactly a man without hands -LRB-
Fuchs	PERSON	consistently refused having his advanced prosthetic arms fitted to him -RRB- and under almost constant video surveillance could accomplish the manipulations required to convert an electric cable into a noose sufficiently robust for successful self-hanging was never properly explained .
		
		Moreover , no prisoner -LRB- especially not an obvious borderline personality disorder case with a very recent record of suicidal behaviour -RRB- is supposed to be in possession of anything -LRB- including belts and even shoestrings -RRB- that could serve this purpose - most certainly not an electric cable .

April 6 , 1930	DATE	, Saint-Germain-en-Laye -
October 1 , 1957	DATE	, La Santé Prison ,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- was the murderer of a French police officer , who became such a devout Roman Catholic while in prison awaiting execution that he has been proposed for beatification .
		
		
Fesch	PERSON	's father was a wealthy banker of Belgian origin , an artist and atheist , distant from his son and who get along with his wife .
		
		"Jacques was a young dreamer aimlessly in life ; brought up a Roman Catholic , he abandoned religion by the age of 17 ."
		
		At 21 , he married his pregnant girlfriend Pierrette in a civil ceremony .
		
		He gave up a position at his father 's bank , lived the life of a playboy , left his wife and their daughter , and fathered an illegitimate son with another woman .
		
		Disillusioned with his life , he dreamed of escaping to sail around the
South Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, but his parents refused to pay for a boat .
		
		On 24
February 1954	DATE	, to fund the purchase of a boat , he went to rob
Alexandre Sylberstein	PERSON	, a money changer , of gold coins .
		
		Sylberstein was struck but not unconscious , and raised the alarm .
		
		
Fesch	PERSON	fled , losing his glasses , and shot wildly at
Jean Vergne	PERSON	, a pursuing police officer , killing him .
		
		Minutes later he was arrested .
		
		Murdering a police officer was a heinous crime and public opinion , inflamed by newspaper reports , was strongly in favour of his execution .
		
		The Cour d'assises of
Paris	LOCATION	condemned him to death on 6
April 1957	DATE	.
		
		At first
Fesch	PERSON	was indifferent to his plight and mocked his lawyer 's Catholic faith .
		
		However , after a year in prison , he experienced a profound mystical conversion , became very pious , and bitterly regretted his crime .
		
		He corresponded regularly with his family , notably his brother and stepmother , and kept a spiritual journal .
		
		He accepted his punishment serenely and was reconciled to his wife the night before his execution .
		
		His last journal entry was `` In five hours , I will see Jesus ! ''
		
		.
		
		An appeal for clemency to President René Coty failed , and he was guillotined .
		
		After his death his wife and daughter honoured his memory as an example of redemption .
		
		At first he was excoriated by the public , but with the work of
Soeur Véronique	PERSON	, a Carmelite nun , and Father
Augustin-Michel Lemonnier	PERSON	, the family effected publication of his writings , and from the
1970s	DATE	these served as an inspiration to many .
		
		On
September 21 , 1987	DATE	the Archbishop of
Paris	LOCATION	,
Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger	PERSON	", opened a diocesan inquiry into his life ; the cause for his beatification was formally opened in"
1993	DATE	.
		
		This has proved controversial , with those who feel his early crimes make him unfitting as a role model opposed to those who emphasize the hope of his final conversion .

George Forster	PERSON	'' ' -LRB- or '' ` Foster '' ' -RRB- was found guilty of murdering his wife and child by drowning them in
Paddington Canal	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.
		
		He was hanged at
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	on 18
January 1803	DATE	, shortly after which his body was taken to a nearby house where it was used in an experiment by Italian scientist
Giovanni Aldini	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		At his trial the events were reconstructed .
		
		Forster 's mother in law recounted that her daughter and grandchild had left her house to see
Forster	ORGANIZATION	at
4 p.m.	TIME	on
Saturday 4 December 1802	DATE	.
		
		
Joseph Bradfield	PERSON	, in whose house
Forster	PERSON	lodged , reported that they had stayed together that night and gone out at
10 a.m.	TIME	on the
Sunday	DATE	
morning	TIME	.
		
		He also stated that
Forster	PERSON	and his wife had not been on good terms because she wished to live with him .
		
		Various witnesses saw
Forster	PERSON	with his wife and child in public houses near
Paddington Canal	LOCATION	during the day on the
Sunday	DATE	.
		
		The body of his child was found on the
Monday	DATE	
morning	TIME	and , after the canal was dragged for three days , his wife 's body was also found .
		
		Forster claimed that upon leaving The Mitre he set out alone for Barnet in order to see his other two children who were in the workhouse there , though he was forced to turn back at
Whetstone	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	| Whetstone due to the failing light .
		
		This was contradicted by a waiter at the Mitre who said the three left the inn together .
		
		Scepticism was also expressed that he could have walked to
Whetstone	LOCATION	in the time he claimed .
		
		The jury found him guilty .
		
		He was sentenced to death and also to be dissected thereafter .
		
		This sentence was designed not only to provide medicine with corpses on which to experiment , but also to ensure that the condemned could not rise on Judgement Day , their bodies having been cut into pieces and selectively discarded .
		
		Forster was hanged on 18
January	DATE	, shortly before which he made a full confession .
		
		He said he had come to hate his wife and had twice before taken his wife to the canal but his nerve had both times failed him .
		
		A recent ''
BBC	ORGANIZATION	Knowledge '' documentary -LRB- '' Real Horror : Frankenstein '' -RRB- questions the fairness of the trial .
		
		It notes that friends of
George Forster	PERSON	's wife later claimed that she was extremely suicidal and had often talked about killing herself and her daughter .
		
		According to this documentary ,
Forster	PERSON	attempted suicide by stabbing himself with a crudely fashioned knife .
		
		This was to avoid awakening during the dissection of his body , should he not have died when hanged .
		
		This was a real possibility owing to the crude methods of execution at the time .
		
		The same reference suggests that his ` confession ' was obtained under duress .
		
		In fact , it alleges that Pass , a
Beadle	LOCATION	on
Aldini	ORGANIZATION	's payroll , fast-tracked the whole trial and legal procedure in order to obtain the freshest corpse possible for his benefactor .
		
		After the execution
Forster	PERSON	's body was given to
Giovanni Aldini	ORGANIZATION	for experimentation .
		
		Aldini was the nephew of fellow scientist
Luigi Galvani	PERSON	and an enthusiastic proponent of his uncle 's method of stimulating muscles with electric current , known as Galvanism .
		
		The experiment he performed on
Forster	PERSON	's body was a demonstration of this technique . ''
		
		The
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	Calendar '' -LRB- a record of executions at
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- reports that , `` On the first application of the process to the face , the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver , and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted , and one eye was actually opened .
		
		In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched , and the legs and thighs were set in motion . ''
		
		Several of those present believed that
Forster	PERSON	was being brought back to life -LRB- '' The
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	Calendar '' reports that even if this had been so , he would have been re-executed since his sentence was to `` hang until he be dead '' -RRB- and one man ,
Mr Pass	PERSON	, the beadle of the Surgeons ' Company , was so shocked that he died shortly after leaving .
		
		The hanged man was certainly dead , since his blood had been drained and his spinal cord severed after the execution .

February 12 , 2003	DATE	#NOM?
Ohio	LOCATION	for the kidnapping and murder of an 18-year-old college student whom he lured to her death with the fake promise of a job interview .
		
		A three-judge panel convicted Fox of aggravated murder and kidnapping and sentenced him to death on
June 27 , 1990	DATE	.
		
		He spent 12 years , 7 months , and 17 days on death row as his case was appealed through the state and federal court systems .
		
		The crime for which
Fox	ORGANIZATION	paid with his life was his first criminal conviction , but
Fox	ORGANIZATION	had been increasingly aggressive toward women in the months before the murder of 18-year-old
Leslie Renae Keckler	PERSON	, testimony at his trial revealed .
		
		In fact , it was the victim of a previous encounter with Fox who helped police break the case .
		
		On
September 14 , 1989	DATE	,
Leslie Keckler	PERSON	applied for a waitress job at a
Bowling Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	|
Bowling Green	ORGANIZATION	restaurant where Fox worked as a grill cook .
		
		As
Keckler	PERSON	was filling out her job application , Fox pointed out Keckler to a coworker and said `` I 'd like to have some of that '' , the coworker testified later .
		
		Fox gleaned
Keckler	PERSON	's telephone number from the application and asked her to meet him for an interview for a restaurant supply sales job .
		
		On
September 26	DATE	,
Keckler	PERSON	went to a local motel where Fox had arranged the job interview .
		
		Keckler 's boyfriend saw her just before she left and
Keckler	PERSON	told him she might be gone for two or three hours .
		
		When
Keckler	PERSON	did not return that night , her boyfriend and her mother filed a missing persons report with police .
		
		Police found the car Keckler had been driving abandoned at a local mall .
		
		Four days later , two boys riding bicycles found
Keckler	PERSON	's body in a rural drainage ditch .
		
		Keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket .
		
		However , a clasp on her brassiere was broken , her belt was unbuckled , two dress buttons were missing , and her pantyhose was torn in the crotch .
		
		Aside from a nearby shoe , police found no other evidence at the scene .
		
		The autopsy revealed that
Keckler	PERSON	had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds .
		
		"She had been stabbed six times in the back ; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs ."
		
		Her right wrist had a deep defensive wound gash , and her face had bruises on her left eye , upper lip , and nose consistent with blunt force injury .
		
		The coroner found no signs of sexual assault .
		
		When the story of Keckler 's murder was publicized , another Bowling Green woman came forward with a nearly similar story .
		
		She had applied for work at a restaurant and received an invitation for an interview for a different position from a man referred to as ``
Jeff Bennett	PERSON	'' but who was later positively identified as
Fox	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		He asked her to come to a local motel -- the same one that
Keckler	PERSON	was headed -- to discuss the job opportunity .
		
		After meeting
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, she agreed to accompany him in his car that evening to discuss the job .
		
		They drove for a while and then parked .
		
		Fox began making suggestive comments and told the woman he thought her dress was too long .
		
		She realized that she had been duped and informed Fox that she was not interested in any job .
		
		In response ,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	asked what the woman would do if someone `` pulled a knife '' on her and asked her for money , or asked her `` to do other things '' .
		
		At that moment , the woman jumped out of the car as
Fox	ORGANIZATION	tried to grab her and said `` come back '' and that he `` was n't finished with -LSB- her -RSB- yet '' .
		
		She made a safe getaway , but did not report the incident to police until after
Keckler	PERSON	disappeared .
		
		The woman provided police with a sketch of her assailant .
		
		A check of the employees at the restaurants where the two women applied for jobs revealed an interesting coincidence : Fox was employed at both places .
		
		Other circumstantial evidence made Fox their prime suspect .
		
		On
October 2	DATE	, an acquaintance of
Fox	ORGANIZATION	told police that the composite sketch resembled
Richard Fox of Tontogany	ORGANIZATION	.
		
		Police confirmed that Fox matched the description of `` Bennett '' and
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's car also matched the description of `` Bennett 's '' car .
		
		That same day , police secured a search warrant for
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's car and found some `` suspicious items '' .
		
		They asked Fox to come to the station to answer a few questions and he voluntarily accompanied them .
		
		Before Fox was placed under arrest , he admitted that in early
May	DATE	he had worked at a restaurant where his first intended victim had applied for a job , that he met her at the motel , and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length .
		
		After his arrest and after being advised of his Miranda rights , Fox admitted he knew Keckler and claimed they had met and spoke at the restaurant where he worked and met again a couple of days later .
		
		He described his encounter with Keckler at the motel on
September 26	DATE	as a date .
		
		Later , at the mall , `` he saw
Leslie	PERSON	and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car '' .
		
		Fox said that he and
Keckler	PERSON	parked , and `` things were getting warmed up '' .
		
		However , `` then
Leslie	PERSON	did not want to participate '' .
		
		Unwittingly ,
Keckler	PERSON	triggered something in
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's psyche as she tried to get away from him .
		
		She called him `` an asshole '' and started to get out of the car .
		
		Fox told detectives , `` no one calls me an asshole '' .
		
		Fox grabbed the woman by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in , then he pulled the coat up over her head .
		
		Fox told police he got a knife out of the glove compartment and stabbed
Keckler	PERSON	in the back , after which he got a rope out of the trunk `` just to make sure she was dead '' and strangled her .
		
		He took police to a rural location outside
Bowling Green	LOCATION	where he dumped
Keckler	PERSON	's purse and other property .
		
		At
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's clemency hearing where the parole board listens to arguments why it should or should not recommend that the governor commute a death sentence , it was revealed that
Fox	ORGANIZATION	had written a letter apologizing to the
Keckler	PERSON	family for his actions : : `` If I could , I would sit down with my victim 's family and try and share how sorry I am , how I have changed and how I wish I could change what happened .
		
		I am sorry , and I must pay for my actions , if it be with a life in prison or if it be by my life , I will do what is required as I know I must pay for my mistakes ! ''
		
		Neither that letter nor his teenage daughter 's tearful plea not to be made an orphan -LRB- her mother had earlier committed suicide -RRB- swayed the parole board .
		
		Fox made no statement before he was injected with the deadly chemicals .
		
		The execution took a total of 13 minutes from the time the first chemical was started until Fox was declared dead .

Sidney Harry Fox	PERSON	'' ' -LRB- born ?
		
		- died 8
April 1930	DATE	-RRB- was a British petty swindler and murderer .
		
		He was executed for the murder of his mother in an attempt to obtain money from an insurance policy on her life .
		
		His case is unusual in that it is a rare example of a known matricide in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.
		
		His murder was detected by then recent advances in forensic pathology .
		
		Fox was described as `` the son of decent working
Norfolk	LOCATION	"parents '' ; little is known of his father , although it has been said that he was a railway porter ."
		
		Fox was in trouble in his teens as a petty thief while in service at good houses , for which he was birched .
		
		Learning from his association with people of quality , he later developed a role as a plausible , genteel con-man until World War I , when he obtained a job in a
London	LOCATION	bank and proceeded to forge cheques on the accounts of his customers .
		
		On discovery of his dishonesty in
1916	DATE	,
Britain	LOCATION	was then in the middle of the Great War and needed soldiers .
		
		Fox was offered immunity from prosecution on condition that he enlisted in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, however he enlisted in the
Royal Air Force	ORGANIZATION	, getting an officer 's commission by claiming to be an Old Etonian .
		
		He drew on his banking experience to forge cheques on his brother officers ' accounts .
		
		He was caught and sent to prison for three months , ending his military career .
		
		Fox and his mother
Rosaline	PERSON	lived on 18 shillings per week -LRB- # in
2010	DATE	-RRB- .
		
		
Mrs Morse	PERSON	awoke one evening to find the gas-tap in her bedroom turned on .
		
		The resultant outcry led to a divorce action being filed by Mr.
Morse	PERSON	, naming Fox as co-respondent .
		
		Fox was arrested on several charges , imprisoned for the jewellery theft and released in
March 1929	DATE	"; he and his mother found it convenient to renew their travelling life ."
		
		In
April 1929	DATE	Fox persuaded his mother to make a will in his favour , despite her poverty , and on
May 1	DATE	, insured her life against accidental death , the policy to expire on 23
October	DATE	.
		
		Some months later , they arrived at a hotel in
Margate	LOCATION	without any luggage and booked rooms .
		
		A week later , on 23
October	DATE	, Fox and his mother ate dinner , Fox buying a half-bottle of port as a `` nightcap '' for her .
		
		At 11.40 pm that evening , Fox raised the alarm that there was a fire in his mother 's room , and her partly clad body was pulled out of it by another guest .
		
		Although a doctor certified suffocation and shock as the cause of death , and
Rosaline Fox	PERSON	was buried in
Norfolk	LOCATION	
a week later	DATE	, the insurance investigators had examined the room and were suspicious .
		
		They believed that a patch of unburnt carpet between
Mrs Fox	PERSON	's body and the gas stove supposedly the source of the flames made
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's story inconsistent .
		
		As a result ,
Mrs Fox	PERSON	's body was exhumed for forensic examination .
		
		Sir
Bernard Spilsbury	PERSON	performed the post-mortem and deduced that
Mrs Fox	PERSON	had been strangled to death , due to a bruise on her larynx , and the absence of soot in her lungs showed that she had been dead before the fire had started .
		
		As a result , Fox was arrested and charged with the murder .
		
		Fox was tried at
Lewes Assizes before Mr Justice Rowlett	ORGANIZATION	, with Sir
Henry Curtis-Bennett	PERSON	and
William Jowitt	PERSON	, 1st
Earl Jowitt	PERSON	| Sir

		The defence were unable to challenge the evidence given by
Spilsbury	ORGANIZATION	since the bruise on
Mrs Fox	PERSON	's larynx had disappeared due to decomposition by the time their experts had examined it .
		
		Jowitt subjected Fox to a ferocious cross-examination , and
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's excuse that he had closed his mother 's door `` so that smoke should not spread into the hotel '' appeared to be cowardly .
		
		The jury therefore convicted Fox and he was hanged at
Maidstone	LOCATION	Jail on 8
April 1930	DATE	, the Home Secretary having declined to intervene .
		
		Cassels later remarked that
Fox	ORGANIZATION	might have saved himself by answering `` I do n't know '' to
Jowitt	PERSON	's question `` why did you shut the door ? ''
		
		Around

Scotland	LOCATION	Yard '' dramatised the story under the title `` Smoke Clings to the Hair '' .
